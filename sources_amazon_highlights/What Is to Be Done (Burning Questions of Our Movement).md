## Highlights
the socialist consciousness of the working masses – the only basis that can guarantee our victory — location: [120](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0974ZHL6Q&location=120) ^ref-27219

Those who have the slightest acquaintance with the actual state of our movement cannot but see that the wide spread of Marxism was accompanied by a certain lowering of the theoretical level. Quite a number of people with very little, and even a total lack of theoretical training joined the movement because of its practical significance and its practical successes. — location: [340](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0974ZHL6Q&location=340) ^ref-957

---
If you must unite, Marx wrote to the party leaders, then enter into agreements to satisfy the practical aims of the movement, but do not allow any bargaining over principles, do not make theoretical “concessions”. This was Marx’s idea, and yet there are people among us who seek-in his name to belittle the significance of theory! — location: [345](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0974ZHL6Q&location=345) ^ref-7945

---
Without revolutionary theory there can be no revolutionary movement. This idea cannot be insisted upon too strongly at a time when the fashionable preaching of opportunism goes hand in hand with an infatuation for the narrowest forms of practical activity. — location: [348](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0974ZHL6Q&location=348) ^ref-19859

---
the role of vanguard fighter can be fulfilled only by a party that is guided by the most advanced theory. — location: [364](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0974ZHL6Q&location=364) ^ref-37194

---
not two forms of the great struggle of Social Democracy (political and economic), as is the fashion among us, but three, placing the theoretical struggle on a par with the first two — location: [368](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0974ZHL6Q&location=368) ^ref-12540

the practical workers’ movement in Germany ought never to forget that it has developed on the shoulders of the English and French movements, that it was able simply to utilise their dearly bought experience, and could now avoid their mistakes, which in their time were mostly unavoidable. Without the precedent of the English trade unions and French workers’ political struggles, without the gigantic impulse given especially by the Paris Commune, where would we be now? — location: [385](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0974ZHL6Q&location=385) ^ref-46455

---
it will be the duty of the leaders to gain an ever clearer insight into all theoretical questions, to free themselves more and more from the influence of traditional phrases inherited from the old world outlook, and constantly to keep in mind that socialism, since it has become a science, demands that it be pursued as a science, i.e., that it be studied. The task will be to spread with increased zeal among the masses of the workers the ever more clarified understanding thus acquired, to knit together ever more firmly the organisation both of the party and of the trade unions…. — location: [396](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0974ZHL6Q&location=396) ^ref-30647

---
there appeared people – and even Social -Democratic organs – that were prepared to regard shortcomings as virtues, that even tried to invent a theoretical basis for their slavish cringing before spontaneity. — location: [528](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0974ZHL6Q&location=528) ^ref-37738

---
– is it not evident that we shall not be fulfilling our task of developing the political consciousness of the workers if we do not undertake the organisation of the political exposure of the autocracy in all its aspects? — location: [962](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0974ZHL6Q&location=962) ^ref-16203

---
Any and every manifestation of police tyranny and autocratic outrage, not only in connection with the economic struggle, is not one whit less “widely applicable” as a means of “drawing in” the masses. The rural superintendents and the flogging of peasants, the corruption of the officials and the police treatment of the “common people” in the cities, the fight against the famine-stricken and the suppression of the popular striving towards enlightenment and knowledge, the extortion of taxes and the persecution of the religious sects, the humiliating treatment of soldiers and the barrack methods in the treatment of the students and liberal intellectuals — location: [977](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0974ZHL6Q&location=977) ^ref-56439

---
the thesis reduces itself to Svoboda’s usual but fundamentally false contraposition of the enlightened workers to the ”masses“. — location: [2714](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0974ZHL6Q&location=2714) ^ref-5196
