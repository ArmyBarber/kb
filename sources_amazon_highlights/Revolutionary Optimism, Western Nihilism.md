Between 1995 and now, the West plundered the Democratic Republic of Congo once again, mercilessly, by using its closest allies in Africa – Rwanda, Uganda and Kenya. Again, between 7 and 10 million people died there, in just 20 years, — location: [483](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07G38G3V3&location=483) ^ref-22468

That’s why they stick to self-righteous lies, deceptions and dogmas delivered to them by the regime’s propaganda. If Communists were right, then they would be wrong. And they suspect that they may be wrong. Communism is their bad conscience, and it brings fear that the bubble of deceptions could one day get exposed. — location: [778](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07G38G3V3&location=778) ^ref-17804

“If we rape and loot, it is because if we don’t, others would! Everybody is the same. It cannot be helped. What we do is essential to human nature.” — location: [788](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07G38G3V3&location=788) ^ref-3184

After being repeated hundreds of times, the rumors, at least for many people, get confused with facts, and then get accepted as facts. — location: [857](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07G38G3V3&location=857) ^ref-14975

One of many reasons why Russia is perceived as a great ‘threat’ is because it inherited the humanist and internationalist foreign policy of the Soviet Union. — location: [880](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07G38G3V3&location=880) ^ref-45022

Russia is recovering irreversibly from those dark days of the free marketer and West’s lackey, Boris Yeltsin. — location: [882](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07G38G3V3&location=882) ^ref-49294

What we hardly ever hear is the most important story of mankind: the story of Western colonial plunders, of imposed slavery, genocides that lasted for centuries, of British-triggered famines that killed tens of millions — location: [929](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07G38G3V3&location=929) ^ref-54239

systematically committing global holocaust. We are not told that it actually happened, and that it is still going on and on and on! — location: [931](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07G38G3V3&location=931) ^ref-46337

The mass media and Hollywood are asked to perform and to deliver results. And they do! Reality and fiction are now being systematically mixed, and everything gets blurred and finally the great confusion and intellectual chaos are managing to overwhelm both reason and logic. — location: [936](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07G38G3V3&location=936) ^ref-30073

For years and decades, the so-called ‘left’ in the West has been moderately critical of North American (and sometimes even of European) imperialism and neo-colonialism. But whenever some individual or country rose up and began openly challenging the Empire, most of the Western left-wing intellectuals simply closed their eyes. They refused to offer their full, unconditional support to those who were putting their lives (and often even the existence of their countries) on the line. — location: [947](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07G38G3V3&location=947) ^ref-62071

Under the horrid leadership of George W Bush (and later Obama and Clinton) Afghanistan, Libya, Syria and Iraq have been reduced to ruins… — location: [956](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07G38G3V3&location=956) ^ref-56163

do most of the Western leftists really support revolutions and anti-colonialist struggles of the oppressed world? I actually believe that they don’t. And this is clearly visible from reading most of the so-called alternative media in both North America and Europe. — location: [965](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07G38G3V3&location=965) ^ref-31567

China can count on its allies in Russia, Latin America, Africa and elsewhere, but definitely not in the West. — location: [985](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07G38G3V3&location=985) ^ref-41335

Russia, ‘the victim’ during the horrid Yeltsin years was ‘embraced’ by the Western left. Russia the warrior, Russia the adversary to Western imperialism, is, once again, loathed. — location: [989](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07G38G3V3&location=989) ^ref-24905

the main reason why the DPRK is hated so much by the Western regime, is because it, together with Cuba, basically liberated Africa. It fought for the freedom of Angola and Namibia, it flew Egyptian MIGs against Israel, it struggled in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) as well as in many other countries, and it sent aid, teachers and doctors to the entire continent devastated by the Western colonialist barbarity. — location: [998](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07G38G3V3&location=998) ^ref-23498

Wars are all extremely ugly. I have covered many of them, and I know… But some of them, those that are fought for the survival of humanity, or for survival of the particular countries, are inevitable. One either fights, or the entire Planet ends up being colonized and oppressed, in shackles. — location: [1008](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07G38G3V3&location=1008) ^ref-51236

If we, as ‘leftists’, have already once decided that imperialism and colonialism (or ‘neo-colonialism’) are the greatest evils destroying our humanity, then we have to show discipline and join ranks, and support those who are at the frontline; if we are not at the frontline ourselves. — location: [1013](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07G38G3V3&location=1013) ^ref-33061

If you boycott Dubai or Singapore, shouldn’t New York or London actually be on the top of your list? Unless you actually live there, enjoying countless benefits financed by imperialist plunder. — location: [1165](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07G38G3V3&location=1165) ^ref-51178

those depressing, paralyzed societies that are always living at someone else’s expense, from someone else’s sweat and blood, while continuously reserving ‘rights’ to moralize and to pass lofty judgments against others. — location: [1173](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07G38G3V3&location=1173) ^ref-8952

it appears that it does not really like anyone who is really fighting and who is winning: it does not like the left that is actually holding power! — location: [1607](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07G38G3V3&location=1607) ^ref-24509

despite those horrid centuries of colonialist and imperialist plunder of the world by Europe and North America, it does not truly believe that the crimes were committed because of Western culture and way of thinking. — location: [1612](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07G38G3V3&location=1612) ^ref-15301

the Western left is howling at the moon, beating its chest in self-righteous narcissist gestures, and essentially insulting those who are fighting, standing tall, building much better world and yes – governing! — location: [1622](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07G38G3V3&location=1622) ^ref-5313
