## Highlights
The creation of British India over Hindustan was predicated on the very same principles that Savarkar would espouse some two hundred years later: that the true history of India was five thousand years long, and that the Muslims in India were foreigners, whose only relation to the native inhabitants was one of despotism. — location: [331](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08H5PLVVH&location=331) ^ref-10679

The partitioning of the subcontinent in 1947 was based on anti-colonial politicians and intellectuals—from Muhammad Ali Jinnah to Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar to Vinayak Damodar Savarkar—internalizing the colonial argument about Muslim foreignness and considering the past five hundred years of the subcontinent as representative of despotism and decay. — location: [4442](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08H5PLVVH&location=4442) ^ref-59157

He wanted the historians to reject any “fixed idea” (namely, Muslim outsider-ness to the subcontinent) and not to “devote years to the elaboration of our curious prejudices and sub-conscious impulses.” — location: [4467](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08H5PLVVH&location=4467) ^ref-29827
