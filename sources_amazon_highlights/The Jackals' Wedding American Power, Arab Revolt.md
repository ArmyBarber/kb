The race hatred which Americans have shown, and continue to show towards the Arabs, and also towards the Russians, isn’t dead and buried like Angleton and Mayhew. This is the reason for publishing the book now. — location: [110](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09T2FBFDM&location=110) ^ref-32365

US Congress added two qualifiers to the provision in the US code which defines genocide as a crime to be prosecuted if Americans commit it. This new US law declared genocide is “the specific intent to destroy, in whole or in substantial part, a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group”[10]. “Substantial part,” the statute now counted, meant “a part of a group of such numerical significance that the destruction or loss of that part would cause the destruction of the group as a viable entity within the nation of which such group is a part.”[11] — location: [270](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09T2FBFDM&location=270) ^ref-3400

the economic and political links that were soon to sway US policy in the Middle East were from the very beginning much stronger with the Zionists than with the Arabs. — location: [490](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09T2FBFDM&location=490) ^ref-56213

US policy towards the Arab and Iranian oilfields was to destroy them at the beginning of world war, and prevent their being taken over by the Soviets or offered to them by the Arabs. This was a highly classified secret, and it is likely that Arab leaders never knew it. — location: [914](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09T2FBFDM&location=914) ^ref-36323

And so the Arab regimes and Israel have sought US protection in conditions of tension and threat they themselves have fostered, in order to strengthen their appeals to Washington. A succession of US Administrations has responded by licensing an ArabIsraeli arms race, a Persian Gulf arms race, and to a lesser degree, a North African arms race.
