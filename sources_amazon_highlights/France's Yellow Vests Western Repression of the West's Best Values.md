## Highlights
France and Algeria were brothers in a culture much older than “Europe” - that of “Mediterranean Culture”.) — location: [217](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09VCL9PSL&location=217) ^ref-5985

---
Western Liberal Democracy is the desire of the elite for debt-slavery to persist, while Socialist Democracy desires to end both slavery and the elite. — location: [250](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09VCL9PSL&location=250) ^ref-21425

---
France’s history is dominated by 2,500 years of contact with North Africa - Scandinavia and Slavs are but recent friends. — location: [276](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09VCL9PSL&location=276) ^ref-55860

1914: “World War to Forestall Socialism” begins, aka World War I. — location: [328](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09VCL9PSL&location=328) ^ref-48671

---
the French Revolution wasn’t even “French”: Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium - these are just the countries where the people were able to join the Revolution, and certainly many more wanted to. — location: [1105](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09VCL9PSL&location=1105) ^ref-23223

---
It’s almost as if the champions of Liberalism don’t want to admit that armed treason with Bismarck was the reason for their victory in France? — location: [1820](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09VCL9PSL&location=1820) ^ref-37847

---
If the Commune represents such a major advance in global leftism because it’s the first sustained example of the dictatorship of the proletariat - for two months -, then the armed victory of an international elite class over such a major advance must herald something equally significant, no? It does: The Commune represents the very neo-imperialist dictates, with their first troops, of what would eventually be instituted as the European Union. — location: [1827](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09VCL9PSL&location=1827) ^ref-42309

---
The European Union is the bureaucratic expression of these forces which defeated The Commune. — location: [1833](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09VCL9PSL&location=1833) ^ref-18955

---
The Commune is a big deal, but we need to make it a big deal for the victors, because they - rightly - are ashamed of it. — location: [1837](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09VCL9PSL&location=1837) ^ref-40113

---
a major theme of Western history: the covering up of the early crimes of Western Liberal Democracy, which hypocritically loves to endlessly focus on the early errors of a far more moral and democratic movement - Socialism. — location: [1856](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09VCL9PSL&location=1856) ^ref-53323

The Civil War in France, the name of Marx’s famed pamphlet on — location: [1886](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09VCL9PSL&location=1886) ^ref-64413

the Commune, was caused by the restoration of popularly-rejected Western Liberal Democracy, and only via a treasonous siege did it remain a “Paris Commune” and not a true “Second French Revolution”. — location: [1887](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09VCL9PSL&location=1887) ^ref-39943

---
100 years after the French Revolution the Third Republic was a “republic” mainly run by royalists! — location: [1901](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09VCL9PSL&location=1901) ^ref-55122

---
no longer a “French” government based on Liberalism - as in 1849-52 - but a new type of Liberalism based on collusion among the international elite: it’s neoliberalism. — location: [1901](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09VCL9PSL&location=1901) ^ref-29672

---
the refusal of Western Liberal Democracy to honestly examine its formative years from 1848-1914 has led to total historical ignorance. — location: [1930](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09VCL9PSL&location=1930) ^ref-3270

Western Liberal Democracy has brutally repressed Socialist — location: [1941](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09VCL9PSL&location=1941) ^ref-435

thought for nearly two centuries. — location: [1942](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09VCL9PSL&location=1942) ^ref-29371

---
Similarly, Iran, Cuba, China and other Socialist-style democracies censor calls to counter their popular revolutions, but there are two key differences: Western Liberal Democracy hypocritically claims to be more tolerant when they are not, and the notion of Western Liberal Democracy’s popular support is a false construction. — location: [1953](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09VCL9PSL&location=1953) ^ref-16884

It remains clearly a class war, and an international one, and that’s why the Commune is so vital. — location: [1962](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09VCL9PSL&location=1962) ^ref-25788

---
We move from the Paris Commune to 1936 because what occurred in 1936 was extremely similar: In February 1936 the electoral victory of a Popular Front coalition in Spain led to a legal take-over by socialists and anti-monarchists, only to see an international coalition of reactionaries arise - to prop up the dictator General Francisco Franco - and to foment civil and international war. — location: [2078](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09VCL9PSL&location=2078) ^ref-5750

---
1936 marks the point when Western leftists indisputably proved that they have abandoned Socialist Democracy in favor of Western Liberal Democracy - a fundamentally right-wing ideology rooted in monarchism, autocracy and oligarchy - and are thus right-wingers on the global political spectrum. — location: [2094](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09VCL9PSL&location=2094) ^ref-5823

---
(The army Franco originally led to start the war was the Spanish Army of Africa, based in Morocco. Much like France with Algeria in 1848 and beyond, we see the pernicious domestic political effects of Europe’s Old World imperialism once again.) — location: [2110](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09VCL9PSL&location=2110) ^ref-34779

---
By June 1939 national polls showed that 84% of Britain favored an Anglo-French-Soviet military alliance - Britain’s Western Liberal Democratic politicians had no choice but to give the appearance of an effort. — location: [2116](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09VCL9PSL&location=2116) ^ref-5767

---
Western leftists (mostly Trotskyists) howled that the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was a betrayal of leftist ideals. That’s a stunningly opportunistic and hollow claim, considering just how much France’s Popular Front and Western Liberal Democracies failed to defend Spain, and also how Western nations refused make peace with Moscow. — location: [2126](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09VCL9PSL&location=2126) ^ref-27187

---
That may seem hard to believe today, but the idea that Western Liberal Democracy was totally dead was a fundamental assumption of leftists, such as Trotsky, just as it also assumed by Marx in 1852. — location: [2134](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09VCL9PSL&location=2134) ^ref-32112

---
overarching theme of European history since 1789: collusion by oligarchical elites to rule in autocratic fashion, and in order to suppress Socialist Democratic ideas. — location: [2137](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09VCL9PSL&location=2137) ^ref-49579

there is no admission regarding the historical reality that Nazism and 1930s European fascism won power precisely because so many people grasped that Western Liberal Democracy — location: [2143](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09VCL9PSL&location=2143) ^ref-9098

was nothing but awful oligarchy. — location: [2145](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09VCL9PSL&location=2145) ^ref-40744

Western Liberal Democracy has much to fear regarding true discussions of their relationship with the Nazis. They, over and over, allied with Fascism against Socialism in the 1930s; they colluded with the surviving Nazis and Fascists after 1945; — location: [2195](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09VCL9PSL&location=2195) ^ref-21578

---
since the 1930s Fascism and Western Liberal Democracy have been cooperating for more often than they have been fighting. — location: [2197](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09VCL9PSL&location=2197) ^ref-45249

either the people have rights which are subject to the arbitrary whims of a shah or a “liberal strongman” like Emmanuel Macron, or they have lawful rights which the forces of order themselves must be made to respect - this cannot be disputed. — location: [5410](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09VCL9PSL&location=5410) ^ref-30210
