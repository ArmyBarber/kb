"The work of the Marxists, however, is _always_ “difficult” but the thing that makes them different from the liberals is that they do not declare what is difficult to be impossible. The liberal calls difficult work impossible so as to conceal his renunciation of it. The difficulty of the work compels the Marxist to strive for greater solidarity among the best elements in order to overcome the difficulties."  
-Lenin, [How Vera Zasulich Demolishes Liquidationism](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1913/sep/30.htm)

"My generous read on Psaki’s being extremely condescending all the time is that she’s completely West Wing-brained and thinks she’s in a Sorkin script which doesn’t really work in real life but instead just comes off cruel and needlessly hostile"
