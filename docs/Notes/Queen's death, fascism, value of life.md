#Capitalism #Imperialism 

- US reaction to Queen's death shows BS of "American Revolution"
	- No solidarity with colonized/formerly colonized nations
	- US itself was/is the colonizer 
	- attacks on monarchy in Declaration of Independence absurd
- Fawning over Queen shows how little some life is valued
	- Core characteristic of the US from inception, any progress has been hard-fought from below, taken place outside of proper channels until after such struggles waged
- Talk of fascism rising
	- US has always been fascist
	- "classical" fascist states have been colony poor
	- Typically thought of fascist characteristics used to jump start accumulation
	- "classic" fascism thus a manifestation of the same underlying process
	- Important to note process is the same, otherwise a devaluing of certain lives is implied
