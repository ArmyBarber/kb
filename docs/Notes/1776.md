[[Myths about the United States]]

[[The Counter-Revolution of 1776]] highlights the role of the preservation of slavery in light of abolition movements on the horizon in influencing America's push for independence. Good deal of focus on the Somerset case of 1772. [[kb/docs/Sources/Books/Book highlights/Liberalism|Liberalism: A Counter History]] touches on this as well. Paraphrasing its description of the impact of the case: if the air of England is too pure for slavery to exist on its land, to the American colonist, thinking themselves Englishmen: "Wtf does that make us?"

[[A Struggle for Power The American Revolution]] provides a convincing argument less focused on ideology, and more on the fact that a split of the colonies from the motherland was inevitable - at the very least, given their growth (with many in the years before seeing the future population of the colonies exceeding that of the UK based on trends), the status quo could not be maintained - something would have to give. Thus, avoiding discussions of whether taxes amounted to tyranny or were the excuses of whiney bitches not wanting to pay their fair share, the more fundamental issue is one of power - "who are they to decide, all the way over there?". Interesting things brought up - many figures in England in the decades prior to 1776 saw the colonies as eventually seeking independence, not seeing the need for protection from the motherland or benefits of remaining colonies being worth it.


> Americaâ€™s push for independence was largely predicated on a desire by wealthy individuals to escape the financial arrangement with England and the timing of that revolt, in line with the birth of the system of capitalism, with an emphasis on property, is not coincidental. When the Founders began arranging a system of government, they designed it with a total emphasis on protection of property and every system was created specifically to curb democratic impulses through checks and balances preferencing white, wealthy men. -

	"the myths that have grown up since 1776 and sticks to the facts, backed up by contemporary sources which highlight the attendant ironies, not to mention the humbug; the American colonists were the least oppressed, on average the wealthiest and the most under-taxed society in the world at the time.""
