# Chapter 1 Two Major Theoretical Achievements of Sinicization of Marxism


## 1.1 Sinicization of Marxism and its Development

### 1.1.1 Proposal of Sinicization of Marxism

To major theoretical achievements of Sinicization of Marxism:
1. Mao Zedong Thought
2. Socialism with Chinese Characteristics

What is it?
- integration of basic principles of Marxism w/ concrete conditions of contemporary China

Mao, October 1938, *On New Stage*:
- communists are internationalists, but can only put Marxism into practice when integrated w/ specific characteristics of country
>Being Marxists, Communists are internationalists, but we can put Marxism into practice only when it is integrated with the specific characteristics of our country and acquires a definite national form. The great strength of Marxism-Leninism lies precisely in its integration with the concrete revolutionary practice of all countries. For the Chinese Communist Party, it is a matter of learning to apply the theory of Marxism-Leninism to the specific circumstances of China. For the Chinese Communists who are part of the great Chinese nation, flesh of its flesh and blood of its blood, any talk about Marxism in isolation from China's characteristics is merely Marxism in the abstract, Marxism in a vacuum. Hence to apply Marxism concretely in China so that its every manifestation has an indubitably Chinese character, _i.e.,_ to apply Marxism in the light of China's specific characteristics, becomes a problem which it is urgent for the whole Party to understand and solve. Foreign stereotypes must be abolished, there must be less singing of empty, abstract tunes, and dogmatism must be laid to rest, they must be replaced by the fresh, lively Chinese style and spirit which the common people of China love. To separate internationalist content from national form is the practice of those who do not understand the first thing about internationalism. We, on the contrary, must link the two closely. In this matter there are serious errors in our ranks which should be conscientiously overcome.[^2]

### 1.1.2 Why did Mao Zedong propose Sinicization of Marxism?

- Scientific reflection (positive and negative) of China's revolutionary practice
- Failure integrate Marxism w/ China's realities resulted in "one right and three left mistakes"
	- Right - opportunistic
	- Left - trying to be "100% Bolshevik"
> Because of the distinctive characteristics of China’s social and historical development and its backwardness in science, it is a unique and herculean task to apply Marxism systematically to China, to transform it from its European form into a Chinese form and thereby to solve the various problems in the contemporary Chinese revolution from the Marxist standpoint and with the Marxist method. Many of our problems have never been considered or approached by the worlds Marxists because, unlike the conditions in other countries, in China the main sections of the masses are not workers but peasants and the fight is directed not against domestic capitalism but against foreign imperialist oppression and feudal practices. This can never be accomplished, as some people seem to think it can, by memorizing and reciting Marxist works or by just quoting from them. It requires a high level of the combination of scientific and revolutionary spirit. It requires profound historical and social knowledge, rich experience in guiding the revolutionary struggles and skill in using Marxist-Leninist methods to make an accurate, scientific analysis of social and historical conditions and their development. It further requires boundless and tenacious loyalty to the cause of the proletariat and the people, faith in the strength, creative power and future of the masses and skill in crystallizing the experience, ideas and will of the masses and in bringing what is crystallized back to the masses for application. Only thus is it possible to make original and brilliant additions to Marxism-Leninism in the light of the historical development of each specific period and the concrete economic and political conditions in China, to express Marxism-Leninism in plain language easily understood by the Chinese people, to adapt it to the new historical environment and Chinas special conditions and to make it a weapon in the hands of the Chinese proletariat and the working people.[^3]

### 1.1.3 What are scientific connotations of Sinicization of Marxism?

Three aspects - the Sinicization of Marxism is:
1. the embodiment of Marxism in instructing China's practice of revolution, construction and reform
2. the abstraction of China's practical and historical experience in revolution, construction and reform into Marxist theory
3. the implantation of Marxism in China's brilliant culture

Theoretical substance - three integrations:
1. Marxist general principles + China's realities
2. Marxist Internationalist content + China's national forms
3. Using Marxism + Developing Marxism

Things to avoid:
1. Marxist "dogmatism" and "pragmatism"
	1. dogmatism - ignoring specific conditions, indiscriminate application of theory
	2. pragmatism - using national context as pretext to arbitrarily revise, tailor theories
2. Marxist "legalism", "Confucianism"
3. Right and left mistakes
	1. Left usually neglect reality, advance rashly
	2. Right usually stick w/ realities, become passive and conservative


### 1.1.4 Necessity of Sinicization of Marxism

1. Meets urgent need to solve China's practical problems
	1. Marxism not so much doctrine as a method
2. Is the internal requirement of development of Marxist theory
>We do not regard Marx’s theory as some thing completed and inviolable; on the contrary, we arc convinced that it has only laid the foundation stone of the science which socialists _must_ develop in all directions if   they wish to keep pace with life. We think that an _independent_ elaboration of Marx’s theory is especially essential for Russian socialists; for this theory provides only general _guiding_ principles, which, _in particular_, are applied in England differently than in France, in France differently than in Germany, and in Germany differently than in Russia.[^4]

Mao: insisted their theory should be regarded as "a branch of Marxism-Leninism"

- Must receive criticism/feedback/acceptance of Chinese masses

### 1.1.5 Possibility of Sinicization of Marxism



### 1.1.6 Differentiation of Sinicization of Marxism and related concepts

Sinicization of Marxism (SoM): historical process
Sinicized Marxism: theoretical achievement of such a process

SoM: nationalization, localization of Marxism
Modernization of Marxism: Marxism + features of the time to make Marxism improve w/ time, continue to answer questions in a scientific way
Massification of Marxism: popularization, specification, and life-orientation of basic principles of Marxism to make it better understood, accepted, and used by the public

Sinicization - spatial dimension
Modernization - time dimension
Massification - subject dimension

"the sinicization of Marxism is not the same as the Marxistization of China. The Marxistization of China is to use Marxism in guiding China's revolution, construction and reform changing China's contemporary conditions transforming China and making China Marxistized. This is different from the sinicization of Marxism"

### 1.1.7 Relationship between the two major theoretical achievements

SWCC: theories on socialist reform, construction, and development
MZT: content on socialist revolution, construction, as well as theories on new democratic revolution

Including MZT w/ SWCC would damage coherence of latter and vice versa

1. we cannot use Mao Zedong to deny Deng Xiaoping nor can we use Deng Xiaoping to deny Mao Zedong because both of them are giants in the process of the rejuvenation of China
2. we cannot use Mao Zedong era to deny Deng Xiaoping era nor can we use Deng Xiaoping era to deny Mao Zedong era because both eras are great historical periods created by Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China
3. we cannot use Mao Zedong Thought to deny the Theoretical System of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics nor can we use the Theoretical System of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics to deny Mao Zedong Thought because both of them are important theoretical achievements of the sinicization of Marxism. Both have great, irreplaceable values

### 1.4.3 What is difficult about seeking truth from facts?



# Chapter 2 Theory on New Democratic Revolution

"It is due to the danger of "national subjugation and genocide" that "saving the nation from subjugation and ensuring its survival" has become a crucial endeavor. That is the basic logic of modern Chinese history"

"The contradiction between imperialism and the Chinese nation and the contradiction between feudalism and the great masses of the people are the basic contradictions in modern Chinese society. Of course, there are others, such as the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat and the contradictions within the reactionary ruling classes themselves. But the contradiction between imperialism and the Chinese nation is the principal one."[^1]

![[Pasted image 20230602182614.png]]

The theme of modern China:
	Not "whether we should resist feudalism and imperialism", but rather "how to resist imperialism and feudalism"

![[Pasted image 20230602183047.png]]

![[Pasted image 20230602184530.png]]

"Mao Zedong here used the method of elimination. He was absolutely right. Revolution was indeed caused by some objective reason that was independent of man's will"

## 2.2 The general line and basic program of new democratic revolution

- General line - fundamental guiding line (vs specific lines)
- General line of new democratic revolution identifies the target, motive force, and leadership of revolution

- ### Target:
	- Distinguishing between foe and friend is primary question of a revolution
	- Major targets determined by social nature, major contradictions of society. For Chinese revolution:
		- Imperialism
			- Reduced China from feudal society to semi-colonial, semi-feudal society
			- Root cause of poverty in modern China
		- Feudalism
			- Landlord class exploits peasants w/ feudal institutions, impeding political, cultural, and economic progress of society
				- (what barriers in modern US society impede progress?)
			- Anti-feudalism:
				- Economically: eradicate feudalist systems
				- Politically: destroy warlords' despotism
		- Bureaucratic capitalism
			- Feudalist, monopolistic national capitalisms et up by compradors
			- Massively appropriated social wealth
	- In different periods, change of major social contradictions changes major enemies
	- The target of revolution includes exploitative and oppressive institutions and relations that underlie them
		- Ex behind imperialism lies unfair international, political economic order


### Motive force of new democratic revolution

- Subject of revolution
- In revolutionary China:
	- CPC
	- Proletariat 
	- Peasantry
	- Urban petty bourgeoisie 
	- National bourgeoise 
- Reasons for their participation in revolution:
	- Need to survive
	- General dissatisfaction w/ reality
	- Patriotism
	- Forceful guidance of revolutionary theories

### Leadership

- Proletariat leadership (vs bourgeoise) is key issue
- General characteristics of world proletariats:
	- Associated w/ advanced production, representatives of advanced productive forces
	- Not in possession of private means of production (selfless)
	- well organized, disciplined
- To gain leadership, political parties/mass orgs must:
	- Lead followers in fighting against common enemies, achieving victory
	- Reward followers w/ material welfare (at least not harm) and educate politically

### Nature and perspective of new democratic revolution

- New democratic revolution was still bourgeois
	- Led by proletarian but included others, not exclusively prole
	- while different from socialist rev, they are related and interconnected

### The general programme of new democratic revolution

- Mao once pointed out that substituting certain capitalist development for foreign imperialist and domestic feudalist oppression is not only inevitable but a step forward
	- Benefits bourgeoisie, but also conducive to proletariat



## 2.3 Path and basic experience of new democratic revolution

### 2.3.1 Gradual formation of new democratic path

- Initially CPC focused on cities, neglected peasants
- Mao remarked on revolutionary paths of western capitalist countries
	- Not oppressed by others but themselves
	- Task of prole parties to educate workers, build up strength, go through long period of legal struggle, oppose imperialist wars
	- When time for insurrection comes, cities will be seized first, then countryside
	- In China, path will be reverse (rural to cities)


### 2.3.2 What is the basis for choosing new democratic revolution path?

![[Pasted image 20230602211715.png]]

### 2.3.3 Three magic weapons of new democratic revolution

1. United front
2. Armed struggle/ Guerrilla war
3. Party building/ revolutionary solidarity

"The three magic weapons not only significantly enlighten our revolutionary success but also shed light upon our personal success. I think people who want to succeed must first have an awareness of "united front" make more friends and fewer enemies handle all kinds of relationships properly and make good conditions for success. One also needs to have the awareness of "armed struggle". Be willing to take tough challenges and meet difficulties to create a solid capital for success. Finally, one also needs to be aware of "party building" that is to make up deficiencies bring out strong suits accumulate steadily and break forth vastly. Keep enriching oneself will create a strong subject for success"

### 2.3.4 Significance of new democratic revolution theory

# Chapter 3 Socialist Transformation Theories

## 3.1 Transition from New democraticism to socialism

### 3.1.1 Why new democratic society was called a transitional society

![[Pasted image 20230605122320.png]]

### 3.1.2 The changing attitude of the party on transition to socialism

![[Pasted image 20230602225123.png]]

Conception soon changed - economy picked up tremendously

![[Pasted image 20230602225514.png]]

Plan was conducting construction and transition at the same time
10-15 years was given as estimate, based on experience of USSR

### 3.1.3 Mao Zedong and Liu Shaoqi's agreement and disagreement over socialist transformation

![[Pasted image 20230602225737.png]]

![[Pasted image 20230602225809.png]]

![[Pasted image 20230602225913.png]]

- The disagreement b/w Mao and Liu was over specific policies, not between two lines
	- After discussion w/in party, Liu gave up original views and supported Mao's


### 3.1.4 Basic content of the general line during transitional period

_Outline of Studying and Promoting the Party's General Line for the transition Period_ (December 1953)
![[Pasted image 20230602230257.png]]

General line should be beacon illuminating all work
Aspects of this line:

1. "fairly long period of time"
2. "Socialist industrialization"
3. "transformation in three aspects"

2 and 3 form core of general line: summarized into "one localization (socialist industrialization) and three changes", latter being socialist transformation of:

1. agriculture
2. handicrafts
3. capitalist industry and commerce

![[Pasted image 20230602232604.png]]

![[Pasted image 20230602232921.png]]



### 3.1.5 What is the theoretical basis for the general line during transition period?

![[Pasted image 20230602233021.png]]

>"The democratic revolution is the necessary preparation for the socialist revolution, and the socialist revolution is the inevitable sequel to the democratic revolution. The ultimate aim for which all communists strive is to bring about a socialist and communist society. A clear understanding of both the differences and the interconnections between the democratic and the socialist revolutions is indispensable to correct leadership in the Chinese revolution."[^5]

> "The substance of the Party’s general line for the transition period is to make socialist ownership of means of production the only economic basis for our country and our society The reason for doing so is that only after we complete the transition from private ownership of means of production to socialist ownership can we rapidly accelerate the development of social productive forces and initiate a technological revolution In this way can we change the situation where the vast majority of our economy uses simple and backward agricultural instruments into the situation where we use various kinds of machinery and the most advanced machinery in order to produce all kinds of industrial and agricultural products on a large scale meet people's growing needs increase their living standards steadily enhance national defense powers resist imperialist invasion ultimately consolidate people's regime and prevent anti-revolutionaries from coming back"
-Mao


## 3.2 Path and historical experience of socialist transformation

### 3.2.1 Three debates about agricultural socialist transformation

- Consensus: after agrarian reform, agricultural sector should be transformed, embark on socialist path
- Points of contention:
	- When?
	- How?
	- At what speed? etc
- 


### 3.2.2 Socialist transformation of the agricultural sector



### 3.2.3 Socialist transformation of handicraft industry



### 3.2.4 Socialist transformation of capitalist industrial commerce



### 3.2.5 Historical experience of socialist transformation



### 3.2.6 Problems in socialist transformation
