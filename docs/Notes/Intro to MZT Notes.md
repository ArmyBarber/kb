"It is due to the danger of "national subjugation and genocide" that "saving the nation from subjugation and ensuring its survival" has become a crucial endeavor. That is the basic logic of modern ChineseÂ history"

"The contradiction between imperialism and the Chinese nation and the contradiction between feudalism and the great masses of the people are the basic contradictions in modern Chinese society. Of course, there are others, such as the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat and the contradictions within the reactionary ruling classes themselves. But the contradiction between imperialism and the Chinese nation is the principal one."[^1]

"Mao Zedong here used the method of elimination. He was absolutely right. Revolution was indeed caused by some objective reason that was independent of man's will"
