# Chapter 2

"It is due to the danger of "national subjugation and genocide" that "saving the nation from subjugation and ensuring its survival" has become a crucial endeavor. That is the basic logic of modern Chinese history"

"The contradiction between imperialism and the Chinese nation and the contradiction between feudalism and the great masses of the people are the basic contradictions in modern Chinese society. Of course, there are others, such as the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat and the contradictions within the reactionary ruling classes themselves. But the contradiction between imperialism and the Chinese nation is the principal one."[^1]

The theme of modern China:
	Not "whether we should resist feudalism and imperialism", but rather "how to resist imperialism and feudalism"

"Mao Zedong here used the method of elimination. He was absolutely right. Revolution was indeed caused by some objective reason that was independent of man's will"

## 2.2 The general line and basic program of new democratic revolution

- General line - fundamental guiding line (vs specific lines)
- General line of new democratic revolution identifies the target, motive force, and leadership of revolution

- ### Target:
	- Distinguishing between foe and friend is primary question of a revolution
	- Major targets determined by social nature, major contradictions of society. For Chinese revolution:
		- Imperialism
			- Reduced China from feudal society to semi-colonial, semi-feudal society
			- Root cause of poverty in modern China
		- Feudalism
			- Landlord class exploits peasants w/ feudal institutions, impeding political, cultural, and economic progress of society
				- (what barriers in modern US society impede progress?)
			- Anti-feudalism:
				- Economically: eradicate feudalist systems
				- Politically: destroy warlords' despotism
		- Bureaucratic capitalism
			- Feudalist, monopolistic national capitalisms et up by compradors
			- Massively appropriated social wealth
	- In different periods, change of major social contradictions changes major enemies
	- The target of revolution includes exploitative and oppressive institutions and relations that underlie them
		- Ex behind imperialism lies unfair international, political economic order


### Motive force of new democratic revolution

- Subject of revolution
- In revolutionary China:
	- CPC
	- Proletariat 
	- Peasantry
	- Urban petty bourgeoisie 
	- National bourgeoise 
- Reasons for their participation in revolution:
	- Need to survive
	- General dissatisfaction w/ reality
	- Patriotism
	- Forceful guidance of revolutionary theories

### Leadership

- Proletariat leadership (vs bourgeoise) is key issue
- General characteristics of world proletariats:
	- Associated w/ advanced production, representatives of advanced productive forces
	- Not in possession of private means of production (selfless)
	- well organized, disciplined
- To gain leadership, political parties/mass orgs must:
	- Lead followers in fighting against common enemies, achieving victory
	- Reward followers w/ material welfare (at least not harm) and educate politically

### Nature and perspective of new democratic revolution

- New democratic revolution was still bourgeois
	- Led by proletarian but included others, not exclusively prole
	- while different from socialist rev, they are related and interconnected

### The general programme of new democratic revolution

- Mao once pointed out that substituting certain capitalist development for foreign imperialist and domestic feudalist oppression is not only inevitable but a step forward
	- Benefits bourgeoisie, but also conducive to proletariat



## 2.3 Path and basic experience of new democratic revolution

### 2.3.1 Gradual formation of new democratic path

- Initially CPC focused on cities, neglected peasants
- Mao remarked on revolutionary paths of western capitalist countries
	- Not oppressed by others but themselves
	- Task of prole parties to educate workers, build up strength, go through long period of legal struggle, oppose imperialist wars
	- When time for insurrection comes, cities will be seized first, then countryside
	- In China, path will be reverse (rural to cities)


### 2.3.2 What is the basis for choosing new democratic revolution path?

### 2.3.3 Three magic weapons of new democratic revolution

1. United front
2. Armed struggle/ Guerrilla war
3. Party building/ revolutionary solidarity

"The three magic weapons not only significantly enlighten our revolutionary success but also shed light upon our personal success. I think people who want to succeed must first have an awareness of "united front" make more friends and fewer enemies handle all kinds of relationships properly and make good conditions for success. One also needs to have the awareness of "armed struggle". Be willing to take tough challenges and meet difficulties to create a solid capital for success. Finally, one also needs to be aware of "party building" that is to make up deficiencies bring out strong suits accumulate steadily and break forth vastly. Keep enriching oneself will create a strong subject for success"

- The disagreement b/w Mao and Liu was over specific policies, not between two lines
	- After discussion w/in party, Liu gave up original views and supported Mao's


### 3.1.4 Basic content of the general line during transitional period

_Outline of Studying and Promoting the Party's General Line for the transition Period_ (December 1953)
![[Pasted image 20230602230257.png]]

General line should be beacon illuminating all work
Aspects of this line:

1. "fairly long period of time"
2. "Socialist industrialization"
3. "transformation in three aspects"

2 and 3 form core of general line: summarized into "one localization (socialist industrialization) and three changes", latter being socialist transformation of:

1. agriculture
2. handicrafts
3. capitalist industry and commerce
