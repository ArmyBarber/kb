# Chapter 2

"It is due to the danger of "national subjugation and genocide" that "saving the nation from subjugation and ensuring its survival" has become a crucial endeavor. That is the basic logic of modern ChineseÂ history"

"The contradiction between imperialism and the Chinese nation and the contradiction between feudalism and the great masses of the people are the basic contradictions in modern Chinese society. Of course, there are others, such as the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat and the contradictions within the reactionary ruling classes themselves. But the contradiction between imperialism and the Chinese nation is the principal one."[^1]

The theme of modern China:
	Not "whether we should resist feudalism and imperialism", but rather "how to resist imperialism and feudalism"

"Mao Zedong here used the method of elimination. He was absolutely right. Revolution was indeed caused by some objective reason that was independent of man's will"

## 2.2 The general line and basic program of new democratic revolution

- General line - fundamental guiding line (vs specific lines)
- General line of new democratic revolution identifies the target, motive force, and leadership of revolution

- ### Target:
	- Distinguishing between foe and friend is primary question of a revolution
	- Major targets determined by social nature, major contradictions of society. For Chinese revolution:
		- Imperialism
			- Reduced China from feudal society to semi-colonial, semi-feudal society
			- Root cause of poverty in modern China
		- Feudalism
			- Landlord class exploits peasants w/ feudal institutions, impeding political, cultural, and economic progress of society
				- (what barriers in modern US society impede progress?)
			- Anti-feudalism:
				- Economically: eradicate feudalist systems
				- Politically: destroy warlords' despotism
		- Bureaucratic capitalism
			- Feudalist, monopolistic national capitalisms et up by compradors
			- Massively appropriated social wealth
	- In different periods, change of major social contradictions changes major enemies
	- The target of revolution includes exploitative and oppressive institutions and relations that underlie them
		- Ex behind imperialism lies unfair international, political economic order
