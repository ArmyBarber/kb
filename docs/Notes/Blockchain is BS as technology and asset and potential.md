- As asset, completely speculative, unstable, many scams
- No assurances from centralization to protect users
- As ledger, git already does same thing
	- Both are merkle trees
- No compelling uses for blockchain

	- Improvements in tech unlikely to improve features
- Little to show far
	- Despite over 10 years, only use seems to be as speculative asset
- Harmful consequences
	- Power use/environmental damage
