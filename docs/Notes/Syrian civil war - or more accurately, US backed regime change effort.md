Crimes by "rebels"

>Whereas the Khan Shaykhun attack killed about 90 people, the Rashideen attack killed at least [126](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria/death-toll-from-aleppo-bus-convoy-bomb-attack-at-least-126-observatory-idUSKBN17H04Y), including [80](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-04-17/syrian-bus-bombing-kills-at-least-80-children/8447104) children en route to Aleppo as part of an international agreement. The only crime of the victims was being Shiite; they were headed to safer ground because their towns of Fuaa and Kefraya were besieged by rebels.

"More than 100 people, including 68 children, were killed in a suicide attack on Saturday in rebel-held northwestern Syria. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the vast majority of the victims were families evacuating from two Shiite villages, Fuaa and Kefraya, long besieged by rebels"
"Prominent opposition figures have long rejected a total evacuation of the Shiite villages, one of the last pressure points to be used as leverage in dealings with the government and its powerful Shiite ally Iran."
