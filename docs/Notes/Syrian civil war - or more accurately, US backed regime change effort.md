# Overall thoughts

The regime-change effort that took place in Syria is tragically misunderstood in mainstream narratives. This misunderstanding (perhaps not the best word since it is deliberately misrepresented) hampers anti-imperialist efforts in the Global North and effectively aids imperialism:
>The Palestine solidarity movement in the Global North is for a variety of reasons not in a position to contribute materially to the military capabilities of the national liberation forces in West Asia. They are, at the time being, only capable of obstructing the maneuvers of the imperialist states under which they reside. For that reason, consciousness-raising and agitation are of utmost importance. By offering celebratory gestures at the overthrow of the Syrian government, solidarity organisations help to shape a consciousness either ignorant of or outright enthusiastic about the long-term efforts of imperialist states to destroy the sovereignty of a Global South country, in turn weakening the sovereignty of other countries in the Global South and hampering the ability of those forces that _are_ capable of providing material support to do just that. The objective result is a solidarity movement at risk of serving as a force multiplier for imperialism’s war objectives.[^1]

**Key themes**

- Domestic support for Assad government - despite real flaws and actual unpopularity amongst some, the feeling for all out regime change was simply not there initially (2011)
- Outside interference and massacres *against* government forces early on, leading to crackdown (as opposed to government forces simply massacring people immediately simply for protesting)
- Rationale for outside interference/regime change efforts, including history of regime change efforts in Syria post WWII
- As things progressed in 2011 and onwards, the crimes of the "rebels"
- The crimes  of sanctions

Crimes by "rebels"

>Whereas the Khan Shaykhun attack killed about 90 people, the Rashideen attack killed at least [126](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria/death-toll-from-aleppo-bus-convoy-bomb-attack-at-least-126-observatory-idUSKBN17H04Y), including [80](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-04-17/syrian-bus-bombing-kills-at-least-80-children/8447104) children en route to Aleppo as part of an international agreement. The only crime of the victims was being Shiite; they were headed to safer ground because their towns of Fuaa and Kefraya were besieged by rebels.

"More than 100 people, including 68 children, were killed in a suicide attack on Saturday in rebel-held northwestern Syria. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the vast majority of the victims were families evacuating from two Shiite villages, Fuaa and Kefraya, long besieged by rebels"
"Prominent opposition figures have long rejected a total evacuation of the Shiite villages, one of the last pressure points to be used as leverage in dealings with the government and its powerful Shiite ally Iran."
