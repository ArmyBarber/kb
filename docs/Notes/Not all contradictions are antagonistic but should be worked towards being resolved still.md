>In fact, in Mao Zedong’s 
view, “socialist society grows more united and consolidated through the ceaseless process of 
correctly handling and resolving contradictions”. These contradictions are not antagonistic, 
but should be resolved through intervention and adjustment.

Reminds me
>Human beings face ever more complex and urgent problems, and their effectiveness in dealing with these problems is a matter that is critical to the stability and continued progress of society. A human is effective not just because he applies to a problem a high degree of native intelligence or physical strength (with a full measure of motivation and purposefulness), but also because he makes use of efficient tools, methods, and strategies. 

\- Doug Engelbart, 1961
