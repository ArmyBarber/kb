>They failed because their conception of what a variant different from bourgeois thought and different from socialist thought inevitably turned out to be merely another branch of bourgeois thought.

“The European working class will only succeed in overthrowing the capitalist order once [the source of its profits] has finally been stopped up,”

What is fascism but colonialism at the very heart of traditionally colonialist countries?

"The work of the Marxists, however, is _always_ “difficult” but the thing that makes them different from the liberals is that they do not declare what is difficult to be impossible. The liberal calls difficult work impossible so as to conceal his renunciation of it. The difficulty of the work compels the Marxist to strive for greater solidarity among the best elements in order to overcome the difficulties."
-Lenin, [How Vera Zasulich Demolishes Liquidationism](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1913/sep/30.htm)

"Communism,” he wrote, “is humanism mediated with itself through the supersession of private property. Only when we have superseded this mediation will _positive_ humanism, positively originating in itself, come into being.”
-Marx

“The essence of man is no abstraction inherent in each single individual. In its reality it is the ensemble of social relations.”
-Marx, [_Theses on Feuerbach_](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/theses/theses.htm)

"By the dialectics of reform and revolution I mean the following: revolution is the _denouement_ of a persistent demand for reform on the part of the people which the system cannot accommodate. Therefore pressing for reform and mobilizing people around a demand for reform is not “reformism”; it is itself a revolutionary task. The problem with social democracy which is avowedly “reformist” is not that it asks for “reform” instead of “revolution” but that, being avowedly “reformist” it tailors and limits its demand for reform only to whatever the system can agree to. It does not ask for reforms that push the boundaries of the system."

"But not to demand something under capitalism because its realization is not possible under capitalism is precisely to miss the dialectics between reforms and revolution; on the contrary the whole point of Left praxis must be to demand things which are not necessarily possible under capitalism."
