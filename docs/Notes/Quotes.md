>They failed because their conception of what a variant different from bourgeois thought and different from socialist thought inevitably turned out to be merely another branch of bourgeois thought.

“The European working class will only succeed in overthrowing the capitalist order once [the source of its profits] has finally been stopped up,”

"The work of the Marxists, however, is _always_ “difficult” but the thing that makes them different from the liberals is that they do not declare what is difficult to be impossible. The liberal calls difficult work impossible so as to conceal his renunciation of it. The difficulty of the work compels the Marxist to strive for greater solidarity among the best elements in order to overcome the difficulties."
-Lenin, [How Vera Zasulich Demolishes Liquidationism](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1913/sep/30.htm)

"Communism,” he wrote, “is humanism mediated with itself through the supersession of private property. Only when we have superseded this mediation will _positive_ humanism, positively originating in itself, come into being.”
-Marx

“The essence of man is no abstraction inherent in each single individual. In its reality it is the ensemble of social relations.”
-Marx, [_Theses on Feuerbach_](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/theses/theses.htm)

"By the dialectics of reform and revolution I mean the following: revolution is the _denouement_ of a persistent demand for reform on the part of the people which the system cannot accommodate. Therefore pressing for reform and mobilizing people around a demand for reform is not “reformism”; it is itself a revolutionary task. The problem with social democracy which is avowedly “reformist” is not that it asks for “reform” instead of “revolution” but that, being avowedly “reformist” it tailors and limits its demand for reform only to whatever the system can agree to. It does not ask for reforms that push the boundaries of the system."

"But not to demand something under capitalism because its realization is not possible under capitalism is precisely to miss the dialectics between reforms and revolution; on the contrary the whole point of Left praxis must be to demand things which are not necessarily possible under capitalism."

"The weapon of criticism cannot, of course, replace criticism of the weapon, material force must be overthrown by material force; but theory also becomes a material force as soon as it has gripped the masses."
-[Marx, A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right 1844](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1843/critique-hpr/intro.htm)

"If there are no isolated phenomena in the world, if all phenomena are interconnected and interdependent, then it is clear that every social system and every social movement in history must be evaluated not from the standpoint of “eternal justice” or some other preconceived idea, as is not infrequently done by historians, but from the standpoint of the conditions which gave rise to that system or that social movement and with which they are connected."
-[Dialectical and Historical Materialism](https://redsails.org/dialectical-and-historical-materialism/)

"It does not follow from Marx’s words, however, that social ideas, theories, political views and political institutions are of no significance in the life of society, that they do not reciprocally affect social being, the development of the material conditions of the life of society. We have been speaking so far of the origin of social ideas, theories, views and political institutions, of the way they arise, of the fact that the spiritual life of society is a reflection of the conditions of its material life. As regards the significance of social ideas, theories, views and political institutions, as regards their role in history, historical materialism, far from denying them, stresses the important role and significance of these factors in the life of society, in its history."
