Biden could have used executive order[^1] or the Fed could buy up the debt[^2], to implement a plan that isn't limited and means tested[^3] [^4], instead of spending years acting like even the meager act he ended up passing (now held up in court)[^5] wouldn't be possible[^6]. Now if I said the same thing about, say, healthcare instead of student loan relief, I realize there would be much more work to do (though a leader who genuinely cared would at least be campaigning/pushing for something like [[Medicare for all would save money and improve lives|Medicare for all]], popularizing the idea and calling out people in the way of getting something passed). But assuming such effort was clearly put in and obstructionism or w/e outside forces still got in the way, I would understand it was beyond the ability of the President to simply make it so.


> In August, Biden announced a plan to cancel $10K-20K of student debt for debtors who earn less than $125K per year. But instead of automatically canceling debt for everyone, Biden forced people to apply for relief. In the two months between Biden’s announcement and the application roll-out, several  right-wing groups filed lawsuits, which now threaten to block the program altogether.
> 
> Biden STILL has the power to cancel student debt with the mere flick of a pen using an executive order* – despite right-wing attempts to block cancellation in the courts.[^7]
