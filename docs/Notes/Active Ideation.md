[[Progressive Summarization]] is: “Collect, Collect more, Bold, Bold, Bold, Collect, Collect more, Highlight the bolds, Highlight the Highlights, Collect, Collect, Summarize a tiny bit, Rewrite an even tinier bit. Collect more.”

**_[Active Ideation]()_** is:

1.  Highlight/Comment/Relate
2.  Create/Connect/Create

For the sake of the quality of your thinking, the difference is night and day. (This is not a new concept, it’s just my take on the a process heavily inspired by the Zettelkasten method.)

-   As you read, you’re actively engaged. You make **highlights** and **comments** as you go — and you’re not afraid to think in the back of your mind: _“How does this_ **_relate_**_?”_
-   Later, with an equally engaged mind, you **create** new notes from the highlights and comments, or you **connect** an idea with an already existing note — and you continue to **create** all sorts of dynamically related and growing ideas.
