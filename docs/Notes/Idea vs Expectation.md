# Idea to get across

- Communism more faithful to goals than capitalism
	- Express general idea of expecations vs reality
	- Cap specifically
		- All men created equal
		- Human rights
		- Liberty
		- Reality
			- Not True
			- Prison, slavery, destruction, war
	- Communism
		- Limited by material reality
		- Outside hositle forces
		- Still achieved
		- WORK TOWARDS IMPROVEMENT


- Back to "Idea vs Expectation"
	- Examples:
		- Marriage
		- Governments
		- Jobs
		- Kids
		- Friendships
	- In all cases things are not always perfect (though there may be thresholds indicating abnormality/dysfunction)
	- At the heart of it: #Contracition, namely: [[Not all contradictions are antagonistic but should be worked towards being resolved still]]
