- Inflation of the role of capitalists/their importance
	- Capitalists take all the risk!
	- Role of "genius" (Musk/Tony Stark)
	- A distinction between "thinking" and (manual/physical) "working" people
		- Initially written w/ the CEO vs workers in mind, this could range from a split between mental/manual labor (between academics/intelligentsia and manual workers) to distinction between nations and races (one need only think of Blackness and slavery)
- Capitalism being the best system ever (or alternatively, the worst system except for everything else - functionally the same thing?)
- "Freedom" being it individual or free markets and how capitalism is the best system for that (what/whose freedom are we talking about though?)
	- related, capitalists/workers freely associate w/ each other and have supposedly equal power when entering contracts based on their mutual need
- Capitalism being the most democratic system/inherently tied to democracy (again, for who?)
