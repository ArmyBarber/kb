## Official

-   For fast, synchronous discussion of potential bugs, the [Obsidian Members Group on Discord](https://obsidian.md/community) is probably your best bet, and the developers ( `@Licat` and `@Silver`) are very active there. `@Licat` handles more of the backend stuff, while `@Silver` primarily does front-end work and handles most customer service things.
-   The best place for longform, evergreen resources, workflow tips, and code snippets is the [Discourse forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/). This is definitely where bug reports and feature requests should go so they don't get lost in the shuffle of Discord conversation. For ease of using it as an archival system, please, _please,_ search before creating a new report.
-   If you really hate live chats and creating new accounts, the [ObsidianMD reddit community](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/) does exist and is monitored by the Obsidian mod team.  
-   Note: Due to the incredible pace of development, it's really hard to keep Obsidian-related documentation up to date. If you'd like to help, you can contribute on [the github repository](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-docs).
-   The [getting started guide](https://dynalist.io/d/CQ4V16tFhIJIfy-rgDK7r1Bp) isn't always the most cutting edge, but it has the benefit of being official. A quasi-official community-run alternative is the [Hub](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/00+-+Start+here), which strives to collect showcases, templates, guides, workflows, courses, and resources (including the Obsidian roundup) into an organized, easy-to-search format. I _strongly_ recommend starting there when looking for information, as it's the most centralized resource I'm aware of. If you know of something that _isn't_ included, please consider submitting a pull request to add it!

## For Beginners

-   Nick Milo has an [Obsidian For Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbLb6QCK88&list=PL3NaIVgSlAVLHty1-NuvPa9V0b0UwbzBd) series on youtube.
-   I really like this [Obsidian basics](https://hackmd.io/KSuvFGtVQcW8LR7G2d_-lA) write-up; it starts very basic which is great for total beginners to markdown, is quite indepth, and has lots of pictures.
-   This is [an organizational system aimed at beginners](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/cut-ter-away-the-chaos-of-your-vault-with-this-one-two-three-four-five-six-simple-method/33700) who aren't quite sure how to roll their own custom system yet.
-   This [Obsidian beginner's guide](https://www.sitepoint.com/obsidian-beginner-guide/) via Adrian Try over at Sitepoint is an excellent starting point!
-   Matt Birchler put together a handy 12-minute [Getting Started with Obsidian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qB2-ciYlt4&feature=youtu.be) video guide.
-   There's [a playlist for Obsidian](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvmlaxyxtsWz428CtIo_Ia8Bhbo8Uvq2f) over at Productivity Guru that does a nice job of introducing the [basics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvmlaxyxtsWwRXCLFmDVIRM-TxiZSMfda).
-   Josh Duffney also has [a nice video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1Kask7oomM) aimed at total beginners.
-   Danny Hatcher put together a beginner's guide for [building a second brain from scratch using Obsidian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njibNuFQwjw). He's also got a [great guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7OUgdvXh0o) for how Obsidian themes and CSS work.
-   Here's the best [how to develop plugins for Obsidian guide](https://marcus.se.net/obsidian-plugin-docs/) I'm aware of.

### Paid Options

-   Nick Milo of the [Linking Your Thinking](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/) workshop has a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC85D7ERwhke7wVqskV_DZUA/playlists) that often touches on things useful to Obsidian, although not all LYT folks are Obsidian users. The primary focus is Personal Knowledge Management. He also has a self-paced [Flight School course](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/obsidian-flight-school) with tons of content and, bonus, it's an Obsidian vault to practice in.
-   Here's a [starter kit](https://developassion.gumroad.com/l/obsidian-starter-kit) from Sébastien Dubois with recommended plugins, explanations of common terms and organizational structures, etc.

## Personal Knowledge Management

-   This [summary of How To Take Smart Notes](https://theknowledgeworker.substack.com/p/how-to-take-smart-notes-in-obsidian) is a fairly nice primer on how many people in the Obsidian community approach note-taking. `@joshduffney` has a more targeted [tutorial](https://www.knowledgeworker.blog/p/how-to-take-smart-notes-in-obsidian) on how to follow the Smart Notes philosophy.
-   This [summary](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NfdHG6oHBJ8Qxc26s/the-zettelkasten-method-1) of the [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/) method is also very informative.
-   The [LYT kit](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/lyt-kit-now-downloadable/390) by `@nickmilo` is a more up-to-date methodology that leans on flexibility and leverages Obsidian's features more specifically.
-   This roundup of [different classification & organization systems that can be leveraged for personal knowledge management](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/cataloging-classification-information-science-pkms-and-you/10071) is a great starting point.

## Appearance

-   `@gitobsidiantutorial` via `@foreveryone` has several [repositories](https://github.com/gitobsidiantutorial?tab=repositories), including some nifty CSS for tabs, some ways manipulate images, kanban boards that work with outline lists, and a handy tutorial for how to set up git with Obsidian if you've never used git before.
-   `@klaas` maintains a list of [popular CSS snippets](https://github.com/Dmitriy-Shulha/obsidian-css-snippets) on github as well.
-   `@Reggie` has a nice youtube [tutorial for how to create a custom theme](https://youtu.be/lyaEnxgow4E).

## Workflows

-   This [meta thread on various sync options](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/meta-post-syncing-between-devices/20983) is meant to offer explanations of how to set up third party sync, which are not generally officially supported by the developers but do often work if you put in the setup time.
-   This [dataview snippet showcase](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/dataview-plugin-snippet-showcase/13673) is an incredibly useful list of how one can leverage the incredibly powerful [dataview plugin](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview), which was also the topic of the first Obsidian Community Talk. Here's [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgzrRNkgsE&t=0s) and [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jW5pD4SioFM) on YouTube. `@SkepticMystic` is currently an excellent point of contact about dataview, although `@blacksmithgu` is the developer.
-   This [meta thread on migration workflows](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/meta-migration-workflows/15252) is meant to be a roundup of methods to people import/transfer from other tools.
-   `@liam`, the mod who is currently most involved with plugin code review and created [Calendar](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-calendar-plugin), Obsidian's most frequently downloaded plugin, maintains an [unofficial FAQ for plugin development](https://liamca.in/Obsidian/API+FAQ/index) that is pretty helpful. This [mini FAQ](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/plugins-mini-faq/7737) is also a handy place to start if you're interested in developing plugins for Obsidian.
-   This [tutorial on how to set up Zotero](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/zotero-zotfile-mdnotes-obsidian-dataview-workflow/15536) (a reference manager) for academic notes and get them into Obsidian markdown format with only a few clicks is really helpful. It also has some tips for leveraging the dataview plugin. `@argentum` and `@cat` are currently good points of contact about this.
-   `@Eleanor Konik` maintains an index of her workflow write-ups & interviews about how she uses [Obsidian for Writing Fiction & Notes](https://eleanorkonik.com/obsidian-for-writing/) that includes links to relevant resources from other writers.
