## Highlights
Socialism in practice conclusively solved many of the worst of humanity’s problems; problems which capitalism had not (and still has not) been able to resolve. — location: [98](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=98) ^ref-48318

---
in a socialist system, where the fruits of labour are shared by the people rather than being monopolized by the capitalist class, the existence of unemployment is a shocking waste of resources. — location: [142](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=142) ^ref-17840

---
The Soviet system . . . gave these republics, regions, and autonomous districts, established over huge territories, the right to their cultural and linguistic expression, which had been despised by the tsarist government. — location: [179](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=179) ^ref-3087

---
it is crucial to bear in mind that capitalist progress was built on a bedrock of colonialism and imperialism. — location: [233](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=233) ^ref-24131

---
The reasons for this are manifold and disputed, but they centre round a failure of the existing economic system to produce significant gains in productivity from the mid-1960s onwards. — location: [360](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=360) ^ref-56057

‘It is a law of technology that the more types of jobs a tool can do, the less specialized and productive it will be’, — location: [399](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=399) ^ref-5283

---
Over-centralization of production ended up impeding the development of more modern, highly technical and capital-intensive industry. — location: [400](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=400) ^ref-19520

---
between 1975 and 1991, industrial labour productivity fell by as much as 50 per cent. — location: [410](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=410) ^ref-545

---
For the leading capitalist powers, an easier life was established through exploitation of the poorer sections of the working class and through neo-colonialism. For the Soviet Union, however, these options were not available. The way to have more food, better housing, better clothes, cars and so on was to produce more, to work more effectively. — location: [465](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=465) ^ref-9571

---
The Soviet Union, as Kotz and Weir found, ‘largely failed to absorb the revolution in communication and information-processing brought by electronics and computers’. By the time of the Soviet collapse, use of computing in industry and military technology is reckoned to have been around twenty years behind that of the United States. — location: [496](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=496) ^ref-19104

---
At ground level, with a heavy emphasis on annual production targets, there was minimal incentive for risk-averse enterprise managers to introduce sweeping technological changes, and in the absence of a centrally-mandated and society-wide information revolution, computerization was somewhat marginalized. — location: [507](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=507) ^ref-20989

---
It is necessary to see to it that those who boldly introduce new technology will not find themselves at a disadvantage. — location: [512](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=512) ^ref-44102

---
Once they realized they were falling behind, Soviet leaders hoped to catch up quickly through technology transfer – importing Western computers and reverse-engineering them. However, US policymakers deliberately made that difficult by imposing tight trade embargoes. — location: [525](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=525) ^ref-27964

---
China, however, has succeeded in its programme of technology transfer, overcoming obstacles that the Soviets weren’t able to surmount. — location: [533](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=533) ^ref-37372

---
An emerging socialist society must participate in the international division of labour in order to survive and then prosper. . . . The Soviet Union could compete with the most advanced capitalist powers individually. But it could not compete when it cut itself off from world markets and they collaborated within world markets. — location: [548](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=548) ^ref-21708

---
It is not fair to say that the USSR ‘cut itself off from world markets’ – in reality it was actively cut out of the international division of labour by the imperialist powers, — location: [550](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=550) ^ref-36481

---
China from the late 1970s developed an incredibly sophisticated means of levering itself into the global economy and thereby absorbing the latest scientific and technological developments in record time, but the circumstances that enabled this may not have been available to the Soviet leaders. — location: [553](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=553) ^ref-39706

---
Producers were concerned above all to meet targets set by planners. They had no particular reason to concern themselves with the wishes of the users of their products, nor with the activities of competitors. Indeed, the concept of competition was absent: other producers in the same line of activity were simply not competitors but fellow-executors of the state plan. — location: [569](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=569) ^ref-60144

if a large section of the intelligentsia stops believing in the basic philosophical and economic underpinnings of society, this constitutes a quite serious problem — location: [582](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=582) ^ref-20924

---
Attempts to rapidly dismantle the cultural/ideological legacy of class society – most notably the Cultural Revolution in China – have not achieved their aims. Socialist society does not emerge ‘on its own foundations, but, on the contrary’, Marx wrote in 1875, ‘from capitalist society’. It is therefore ‘in every respect, economically, morally, and intellectually, still stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it emerges’. — location: [587](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=587) ^ref-60756

Socialism Betrayed — location: [598](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=598) ^ref-64315

---
‘the shadow economy was running out of space for expanded reproduction; consequently, its bosses raised the question of how to weaken political restraints by influencing the state and Party apparatus, including the CPSU Central Committee, from the inside. It was under such pressures that perestroika came into existence.’ — location: [611](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=611) ^ref-63071

---
Capitalism is actually far superior to socialism when it comes to the industry of death and destruction: in an economy aimed at furnishing profits for corporations, a large market for high-value single-use products like nuclear bombs is a wonderful thing, hence the position of the military-industrial complex at the heart of United States government. — location: [630](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=630) ^ref-5678

A key issue was the absence of an effective feedback loop. — location: [651](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=651) ^ref-62694

---
The early period of his rule, from 1964 to around 1973, is generally considered as having been rather successful in terms of economic growth and geopolitical consolidation. — location: [659](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=659) ^ref-33618

Andropov seemed to understand the problems facing the Soviet Union and to have a sensible vision for addressing them. — location: [672](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=672) ^ref-29122

---
the economic problems fed into a general sentiment of dissatisfaction that reduced the masses’ confidence in socialism and, therefore, their willingness to fight for it when it came under attack. The economic problems also created a stratum of people who felt they would do better under conditions of capitalism: people running small businesses in the informal sector who would benefit from freer markets; and managers and intellectuals who saw socialism as an impediment to a life of privilege. — location: [684](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=684) ^ref-29124

---
Rather than carry out a fundamental economic reform – as China had been doing for a decade – Gorbachev and then Yeltsin capitulated to the West, dissolved the Communist Party, accepted shock therapy and the break-up of the USSR. — location: [690](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=690) ^ref-31888

---
By the time the Communist Party leadership itself started (under Gorbachev) to challenge the basic beliefs underlying the system, the masses were by and large sufficiently alienated from these beliefs that they were ambivalent in the face of this cyclopean act of social sabotage. — location: [714](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=714) ^ref-55746

---
Yet this same leadership had supported Stalin when he was alive. This disparity can at least be partly explained by the fast-changing political environment. Harsh repression and the personality cult both had their roots in political necessity, in a context where the young Soviet state was desperately struggling for its life. — location: [732](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=732) ^ref-36102

---
Instead of the European working class coming to the aid of its Soviet brothers and sisters, the European ruling classes came to the aid of the White Army of deposed capitalists and landowners in order to destroy the Soviet project. — location: [744](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=744) ^ref-5549

---
On the contrary, the personalities and motives of Stalin and the other leaders were socially formed according to the requirements of the situation, and the leadership itself was socially selected on the basis of the effects of these two elements. — location: [758](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=758) ^ref-59511

---
It should have been possible to make political changes without launching a severe frontal attack on Stalin and all that he represented. Stalin was the most prominent Soviet leader from 1924 until his death in 1953. In other words, Stalin led the USSR for twenty-nine of the thirty-six years of the USSR’s existence. To criticize him so harshly, to tear down a personality cult so suddenly, meant to cast doubt on the entire Soviet experience to that point; it meant to delegitimize the extraordinary achievements of the CPSU and the Soviet people during the Stalin era. — location: [804](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=804) ^ref-10136

---
We fought the Nazis with the battle cry ‘For the Homeland! For Stalin!’, and they wanted to pull down the statue. Over our dead bodies, we said. We stood firm, and we won.

---
the first steps towards undermining Soviet ideology had been taken, and these laid the ground for the generation of right-wing and liberal intellectuals who, in the Gorbachev era, made their way to the heart of government and led the dismantling of socialism. — location: [829](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=829) ^ref-14212

‘to put it in the simplest terms, the October Revolution created a world communist movement, the 20th Congress destroyed it’. — location: [833](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=833) ^ref-8093

---
There is a considerable continuity in Stalin’s efforts to keep the hostility of capitalist powers at bay, and Khrushchev’s call for peaceful coexistence. — location: [885](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=885) ^ref-51897

in the industrialized world the insurrectionary ferment of the now largely sated working class was replaced by the alienation of students and racial minorities.’ — location: [896](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=896) ^ref-8595

---
The Soviet Union was less experienced in dealing with these movements than it was with the traditional organizations of the industrial working class, and Soviet socialism had a less obvious appeal for them. — location: [897](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=897) ^ref-17723

the Chinese strongly encouraged Khrushchev to intervene in Hungary in 1956, but then denounced the intervention in Czechoslovakia as an example of ‘social imperialism’. — location: [903](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=903) ^ref-51931

---
the theory of the general crisis severely underestimated post-war capitalism’s ability to cheat death. The Soviet Union won the Second World War, but in so doing it sustained the most horrific human and economic losses. The United States, meanwhile, had been able to attach itself to the winning side and turn a handsome profit at the same time. — location: [941](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=941) ^ref-46747

---
the US was able to breathe new life into global capitalism after the Second World War by using its economic dominance to reduce inter-imperialist rivalry, give a kick-start to economic globalization, introduce some Keynesian reforms, prevent several countries from adopting socialism (via bribery, coups and/or military intervention), and unite efforts to isolate and destabilize the socialist camp. — location: [956](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=956) ^ref-4388

---
The United States had a number of advantages that enabled it to sustain steady growth throughout the 1950s and 1960s: unlike the Soviet Union, it was not devastated by war; unlike in the Soviet Union, wars and military expenditure constituted an economic boost rather than a drain; unlike the Soviet Union, it benefited immensely from the exploitation of people and resources in the developing world; and unlike the Soviet Union, it felt no particular obligation to privilege the basic needs of the masses over the exploration of new markets and technologies. — location: [973](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=973) ^ref-25912

once an expectation is set, the failure to meet it creates disappointment. — location: [980](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=980) ^ref-53119

---
By the late 1970s, Soviet growth was grinding to a halt, just as the United States and Western Europe were starting to dial up their attacks on the organized working class, privatizing, globalizing, deregulating, lowering wages, and leveraging technology to stimulate a redefined economy with the balance of power tipped even further in favour of the capitalist class. — location: [982](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=982) ^ref-6879

---
The need to widen democracy and allow greater individual freedoms is a complex problem for socialist states under siege. In a world dominated by imperialism, a socialist leadership has to carefully balance responding to the legitimate demands and needs of the people with not creating structures that can easily be leveraged by hostile states to destabilize and to spread disinformation. — location: [1012](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=1012) ^ref-35178

---
With a declining communist and collectivist mentality, a capitalist and individualist mentality reappeared quickly to fill the gap, fuelled by Western propaganda and by the habits preserved in the social fabric through many centuries of class society pre-1917. — location: [1037](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=1037) ^ref-35500

All this, to use Marx’s terminology, are consequences of the alienation of labour and they do not automatically and suddenly evaporate from the mind, although alienation itself has already been abolished. — location: [1043](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=1043) ^ref-21642

In a context of rising alienation, economic stagnation and ideological deterioration, it was easy enough for the seeds of counterrevolution to sprout. — location: [1059](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=1059) ^ref-50821

This economic warfare did not stop with denying the Soviets access to high-tech; the US also sabotaged the goods the Soviets did receive. — location: [1114](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=1114) ^ref-28559

the CIA and the Pentagon ‘abandoned the idea of the mere “containment” of communism in favour of using military force to push back against its exertions – even when these were met with massive popular support’. — location: [1138](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=1138) ^ref-12789

The struggle that the Emir of Afghanistan is waging for the independence of Afghanistan is objectively a revolutionary struggle, despite the monarchist views of the Emir and his associates, for it weakens, disintegrates and undermines imperialism. — location: [1176](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=1176) ^ref-33196

Land reform, debt cancellation and gender equality should have been popular among the masses of poor peasants, but the landowners and mullahs had better access to these people and were able to convince many of them that the PDPA’s programme was a ruthless attack on Islam by godless urban communists. — location: [1216](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=1216) ^ref-6301

The first Russian troops crossed the border into Afghanistan on December 25, 1979. The scope of their mission was limited: help their contacts in the PDPA to overthrow Amin and establish the Parcham leader Babrak Karmal as head of state; end the feuding in the PDPA; help the Afghan Army gain the upper hand against the uprising; and come home soon. There was absolutely no question of wanting to colonize or occupy Afghanistan. — location: [1254](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=1254) ^ref-61640

an opponent of the Soviet intervention, writes, ‘What I saw in 1981, and on three other visits to several cities over the 14 years that the PDPA was in charge, convinced me that it was a much less bad option than the regime on offer from the western-supported Mujahedin.’ — location: [1287](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=1287) ^ref-51435

When I visited Afghanistan in September 2008 . . . I was told by almost every Afghan I met that things were better under the Russians. . . .

The United States deployed increasingly sophisticated weaponry to the rebel groups at just the right rate so as to prevent the Soviet Union from either winning or withdrawing. — location: [1296](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=1296) ^ref-5954

---
It’s worth pointing out that Gorbachev never put much meat on the bones of ‘democratization’. With hindsight, it’s obvious that his use of the term reflected an ideological concession to Western ‘liberal’ capitalism; that he had come to believe that the Soviet Union should aspire to the political norms defined in Western Europe and the United States. — location: [1518](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=1518) ^ref-61617

a level of political repression is an unhappy necessity.

The Soviet political system was undeniably rife with problems: the alienation and disaffection of young people, excessively centralized decision-making, corruption, arbitrariness by police and officials, insufficient levels of popular participation in the soviets, and more. But these were not problems that could be solved by imitating a Western bourgeois-democratic model that had no cultural and social basis in the USSR. Rather, political reforms should have attempted to build on and improve the existing system. — location: [1536](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=1536) ^ref-16872

Szymanski describes ‘a few basic assumptions of Soviet society’ that were not debated in the press: socialism as a system, communism as a goal, and the leading role of the Communist Party. ‘These issues are considered to have been settled once and for all and public discussion of them is considered by the regime to be potentially disruptive of popular rule.’ — location: [1549](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=1549) ^ref-34125

Glasnost, then, was an attempt to ‘unleash the public’, where the public was defined as people who unambiguously supported perestroika. — location: [1567](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=1567) ^ref-59841

Given almost complete autonomy in the areas of media and propaganda, Yakovlev went about ‘overcoming myths and utopias’ by doing everything possible to attack the CPSU and Soviet history.

It is disgusting to see how many people, even in the Soviet Union itself, are engaged in denying and destroying the history-making feats and extraordinary merits of that heroic people. That is not the way to rectify and overcome the undeniable errors made by a revolution that emerged from tsarist authoritarianism in an enormous, backward, poor country.

Attacking the CPSU backfired badly for Gorbachev. He had made a dangerous assumption: that the liberals and nationalists he promoted would give him the political support denied him by the communists, thus allowing him to realize his dreams of a mixed economy with a welfare state and political pluralism.

Gorbachev responded to the US request that the Soviet Union participate in the 1991 Gulf War by saying, ‘I want to emphasize that we would like to be by your side in any situation.

frustrated by the economic crisis and falling prey to the cynical demagoguery of Yeltsin and his coterie who blamed all problems on socialist planning and the ‘privileged bureaucracy’, coal miners carried out strikes on an unprecedented scale.

the proportion of ‘yes’ votes was slightly lower in Russia (73 per cent) and Ukraine (71 per cent) but extremely high in the Central Asian republics (over 94 per cent in Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan) and Belarus. This reflects a growing eurocentrism and reactionary nationalism within Russia and Ukraine that resented sharing a state with ‘backward’ and ‘burdensome’ Asians – a prejudice that Yeltsin and others played to. — location: [1763](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=1763) ^ref-63798

Yeltsin led the drive towards greater autonomy for Russia. He is on record as saying, in 1990, ‘I soon understood that there would be no radical reforms at an all-Union level . . . and so I thought to myself: If the reforms cannot be carried out at that level, why not try in Russia?’ — location: [1768](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=1768) ^ref-24690

The USSR’s dissolution at the end of 1991 was in that sense profoundly anti-democratic. However, crisis and confusion were so entrenched that, while people might vote for socialism, most were not mobilized to fight for it. — location: [1774](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=1774) ^ref-19986

the Soviet Union and its allies in the German Communist Party (KPD) had pushed strongly for a unified German state that would have multi-party elections, that would be prevented from rearmament and that would be committed to neutrality. — location: [1831](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=1831) ^ref-15312

Germany: the Federal German Republic (FRG), established in May 1949. It was only then that the GDR was set up as a separate, socialist state. The border in Berlin then became the nexus for covert actions by Western imperialism against the socialist bloc (it should be recalled that, throughout this era, US-led capitalism was waging a horrifically violent global crusade against progressive forces, from Cuba to Korea, from Vietnam to Indonesia, from Guatemala to Congo). — location: [1835](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=1835) ^ref-48302

Breaking with the tradition that the Politburo and Central Committee should have representation from all the republics, Gorbachev oversaw a ‘russification’ of the central bodies, feeding into resentment and rising complaints about Russian chauvinism. — location: [1857](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=1857) ^ref-39951

The first republic to quit the USSR was Russia in June 1990. This was an unconstitutional move made by Yeltsin. It was motivated primarily by the impatience of the neoliberal hawks, who wanted to go faster than Gorbachev down the capitalist road. — location: [1869](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=1869) ^ref-50521

Now the Russian Republic was asserting its right to control its own natural resources and their disposition. The leaderships of the republics which had previously been relatively quiet now immediately passed sovereignty resolutions. By August 1990 sovereignty resolutions had been passed by Uzbekistan, Moldavia, Ukraine, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan. By October even loyal Kazakhstan followed suit as well. — location: [1875](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=1875) ^ref-21381

It is now widely believed that US-led finance capital knowingly directed the post-Soviet Russian economy into disaster so as to: 1) thoroughly wipe out the economic roots of socialism by replacing it with gangster anarcho-capitalism; and 2) to prevent the Russian Federation from becoming a serious competitor to US post-Cold War hegemony. — location: [2009](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=2009) ^ref-12551

If the USSR had been able to overcome its economic stagnation from the 1970s onwards, there’s every reason to believe it would still exist today.

in the 1930s and ’40s, the heavily centralized Soviet economy was working very well: ‘The rapid development of modern industry was interwoven with the construction of a welfare state that guaranteed the economic and social rights of citizens in a way that was unprecedented.’ — location: [2080](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087V4ZTDP&location=2080) ^ref-362

Gorbachev’s reforms were implemented in an impatient, heavy-handed, top-down way, without consulting the people or attempting to collate feedback. His methodology was profoundly flawed.

The attack on the Party was putatively carried out in the name of enhancing democracy, yet the results turned out to be profoundly anti-democratic.
