spite of the unprecedented statement by the G8 scientists ahead of next month’s Gleneagles summit—George W. Bush, the US president, insists we still do not know enough about this literally world-changing phenomenon.” Washington then “succeeded in removing language calling for prompt action to control global warming” and eliminating such inflammatory statements as “Our world is warming,” because “Mr. Bush has said global warming is too uncertain a matter to justify anything more than voluntary measures.” — location: [330](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000Q9IU7U&location=330) ^ref-7734

Between 1980 and 2003, there were 315 suicide attacks worldwide, initially for the most part by the secular Tamil Tigers.

“US forces and policies are completing the radicalization of the Islamic world, something Osama bin Laden has been trying to do with substantial but incomplete success since the early 1990s.

Seeking to provoke Iraq into some action that could be portrayed as a casus belli, London and Washington renewed their bombing of Iraqi targets in May 2002, with a sharp increase in September 2002. In the nine months leading up to the official start of the war in March 2003, US and UK planes flew almost 22,000 sorties, hitting 391 “carefully selected targets,” — location: [506](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000Q9IU7U&location=506) ^ref-3637

These sites had been secured by UN inspectors, but the invaders dismissed them, leaving the sites unguarded. The immediate consequence was sophisticated and massive looting of these installations. — location: [546](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000Q9IU7U&location=546) ^ref-36003

The official justification for the invasion was to prevent the use of WMDs that did not exist. The invasion provided the terrorists who had been mobilized by the United States and its allies with the means to develop WMDs—namely, equipment that the United States and others had provided to Saddam Hussein, — location: [554](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000Q9IU7U&location=554) ^ref-44322

The invasion of Iraq is perhaps the most glaring example of the low priority assigned by Washington planners to the threat of terror, but there are numerous others. — location: [568](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000Q9IU7U&location=568) ^ref-53577

Fortunately, Western commentators are saved from the unambiguous conclusion, thanks to our self-exemption from the most elementary of moral principles, the principle of universality. — location: [675](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000Q9IU7U&location=675) ^ref-45432

It is a rational calculation, on the assumption that human survival is not particularly significant in comparison with short-term power and wealth. And that is nothing new. These themes resonate through history. The difference today is only that the stakes are enormously higher. — location: [690](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000Q9IU7U&location=690) ^ref-46734

The crucial issue throughout the post-World War II period, however, has been control, more so than access or profit. And that concern for “critical leverage” in world affairs will presumably remain true for the foreseeable future. — location: [716](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000Q9IU7U&location=716) ^ref-9872

AMONG THE MOST salient properties of failed states is that they do not protect their citizens from violence—and perhaps even destruction— or that decision makers regard such concerns as lower in priority than the short-term power and wealth of the state’s dominant sectors. Another characteristic of failed states is that they are “outlaw states,” whose leaderships dismiss international law and treaties with contempt. — location: [718](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000Q9IU7U&location=718) ^ref-31745

The attack began with a bombing campaign intended to drive out all but the adult male population; men ages fifteen to forty-five who attempted to flee Falluja were turned back. The plans resembled the preliminary stage of the Srebrenica massacre, though the Serb attackers trucked women and children out of the city instead of bombing them out. — location: [851](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000Q9IU7U&location=851) ^ref-62916

Thus the front page of the world’s leading newspaper was cheerfully depicting war crimes for which the political leadership could be sentenced to severe penalties under US law, the death penalty if patients ripped from their beds and manacled on the floor happened to die as a result. — location: [881](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000Q9IU7U&location=881) ^ref-62105

The new constitution, the Wall Street Journal notes, has “far deeper Islamic underpinnings than Iraq’s last one, a half century ago, which was based on [secular] French civil law,” and had granted women “nearly equal rights” with men. — location: [945](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000Q9IU7U&location=945) ^ref-47362

The conclusions of the study, carried out on rather conservative assumptions, are that “the death toll associated with the invasion and occupation of Iraq is probably about 100,000 people, and may be much higher.” — location: [956](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000Q9IU7U&location=956) ^ref-30133

The relatively high nutritional levels of Iraqis in the 1970s and 1980s, even through the war with Iran, began to decline severely during the decade of the sanctions, with a further disastrous decline after the 2003 invasion. — location: [986](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000Q9IU7U&location=986) ^ref-49574

The authors of the study comment that it is as if college students in Germany estimated Holocaust deaths at 300,000, in which case we might conclude that there are some problems in Germany—and if Germany ruled the world, some rather more serious problems. — location: [1003](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000Q9IU7U&location=1003) ^ref-47230

It is an interesting comment on the prevailing moral-intellectual culture that unsupported slander of opponents who are unidentified is considered legitimate practice, particularly among those who modestly describe themselves as “the decent left”—indeed highly meritorious, as long as the conclusions come out the right way. — location: [1019](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000Q9IU7U&location=1019) ^ref-32433

It is a remarkable fact that Washington planners have had more trouble controlling Iraq than Russia had in its satellites or Germany in occupied Europe, where the countries were run by domestic governments and security forces for the most part, with the ruling power in the background to sustain the client regimes. — location: [1029](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000Q9IU7U&location=1029) ^ref-6802

The sanctions, he wrote, “treat Iraq as a massive refugee camp to be provided with emergency relief. What Iraqis need is to be able to regenerate their economy and resume reconstruction and development. This means that essential services and the infrastructure have to be given a high priority, and the import programme has to be geared to raising domestic production,” precisely what the US-imposed sanctions regime prevented. — location: [1052](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000Q9IU7U&location=1052) ^ref-54987

Halliday resigned in protest in 1998, condemning the sanctions as “genocidal.” Von Sponeck resigned two years later, for similar reasons. — location: [1058](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000Q9IU7U&location=1058) ^ref-16776

the comparison to South Africa, where the sanctions evaded by the Reaganites were welcomed by the black majority despite the harm caused them.

When an international tribunal was established to try war crimes in the Balkan wars, a group of international lawyers requested the tribunal to investigate NATO crimes during the Serbian bombing campaign, presenting documentary evidence recorded by the major international human rights organizations, along with revealing admissions by the NATO command. — location: [1183](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000Q9IU7U&location=1183) ^ref-49267

In short, the Mexican press concluded, “Rice was telling the Mexicans . . . that while they had a water treaty to live up to, the United States could simply withdraw from a signed agreement that it found ‘inappropriate.’ — location: [1239](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000Q9IU7U&location=1239) ^ref-29657

Therefore, contrary to what others mistakenly believe, it was quite appropriate for Washington to refuse to pay its UN dues from the Reagan years until 2001, when Washington changed course because it then needed international support. — location: [1253](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000Q9IU7U&location=1253) ^ref-777

“new thinking in the law of war,” which takes international law and treaties to be “private contractual rules” that the more powerful party “is free to apply or disregard as it sees fit”: sternly enforced to ensure a safer world for investors, but quaint and obsolete when they constrain Washington’s resort to aggression and other crimes. — location: [1259](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000Q9IU7U&location=1259) ^ref-55734

---
But in the longer term, by far the most important was that such an operation (and the reasoning that led to the decision to undertake it) threatened to undermine the very fabric of international relations. That decision repudiated a century of slow, intermittent and often painful progress towards an international system based on cooperative security, multilateral decision-making, collective action, agreed norms of behaviour and a steadily growing fabric of law — location: [1285](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000Q9IU7U&location=1285) ^ref-26931

The NPT was based on two central agreements: “In return for renouncing the option of acquiring nuclear weapons for themselves, ‘non-nuclear-weapon states’ were promised, first, unimpeded access to nuclear energy for nonmilitary use, and second, progress on nuclear disarmament” — location: [1293](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000Q9IU7U&location=1293) ^ref-48749

Washington has gone out of its way to instruct Iran on the need for a powerful deterrent, not only by invading Iraq, but also by strengthening the offensive forces of its Israeli client, which already has hundreds of nuclear weapons as well as air and armored forces larger and more advanced than any NATO power other than the United States. — location: [1352](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000Q9IU7U&location=1352) ^ref-21404

major European firms as Thyssen-Krupp and the British oil giant BP have withdrawn major investments in Iran, fearing US government sanctions or other consequences of actions “offensive to the US.” — location: [1361](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000Q9IU7U&location=1361) ^ref-21767

If logic and moral truisms mattered, the US and British governments and supporters of their doctrine of “anticipatory self-defense” should be calling on Iran to develop a nuclear deterrent. — location: [1366](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000Q9IU7U&location=1366) ^ref-24290

According to South Korean president Roh Moo-hyun, “North Korea professes that nuclear capabilities are a deterrent for defending itself from external aggression.

the primary reason the NPT now faces collapse is the failure of the nuclear states to live up to their obligation under Article VI to pursue “good faith” efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons. — location: [1384](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000Q9IU7U&location=1384) ^ref-52814

November, the UN Committee on Disarmament voted in favor of a verifiable FISSBAN.

For the first time in history, a state—the “idealistic New World”—was observing “principles and values,” acting from “altruism” and “moral fervor,” while leading the “enlightened states.” It was therefore free to resort to force for what its leaders determine to be right. — location: [1486](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000Q9IU7U&location=1486) ^ref-56187

The legitimacy of use of force is not the only issue on which public opinion in the United States diverges sharply from elite political culture.

the most detailed inquiry into the Srebrenica massacre, by the Dutch government, concluded that Milošević had no connection to it, and that he “was very upset when he learnt about the massacres,” the Dutch scholar who headed the team of intelligence specialists reported.

Only now under President Chávez, the former parachute colonel elected to office in 1998, has medicine started to become something of a reality for the poverty-stricken majority in the rich but deeply divided—virtually non-functioning—society.

These were transmitted sympathetically by Israeli military intelligence but rejected or ignored by the higher political echelons, which insisted on “substantial border changes” and had no intention of reaching any agreement, acting “with determination to thwart any Palestinian hopes in that direction [while] Israel forbade any political activity. — location: [3148](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000Q9IU7U&location=3148) ^ref-33325

By adopting this extreme rejectionist stance, Gazit believes, the US-backed Labor governments of the early 1970s bear significant responsibility for the rise of the fanatic Gush Emunim settler movement, and eventually the Palestinian resistance that developed many years later in the first intifada—after years of state terror, settler brutality, and steady takeover of valuable Palestinian lands and resources. — location: [3153](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000Q9IU7U&location=3153) ^ref-30608

Focus on testing does not advance, and probably harms, such objectives, for which quite different initiatives would be required. — location: [4071](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000Q9IU7U&location=4071) ^ref-21108

A large majority of the public believe that the United States should accept the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the World Court, sign the Kyoto protocols, allow the United Nations to take the lead in international crises, and rely on diplomatic and economic measures more than military ones in the “war on terror.” Similar majorities believe the United States should resort to force only if there is “strong evidence that the country is in imminent danger of being attacked,” thus rejecting the bipartisan consensus on “preemptive war” — location: [4102](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000Q9IU7U&location=4102) ^ref-55794

When the Bush administration released its budget in February 2005, PIPA did a study of popular attitudes about what the budget should be.

The World Bank and others stimulate borrowing by the rich and powerful in the poor countries, the risky loans yield high returns, and when the system crashes, structural adjustment programs transfer the costs to the poor, who never borrowed the money in the first place and gained little from it, and to the taxpayers of the North.

The rapidly escalating costs of health care are threatening a serious fiscal crisis, along with immeasurable human costs. Infant mortality is one major index.

These estimates are seriously understated because of the ideological decision not to count the costs for individuals—for doctors who waste their own time or are forced to misuse it, or for patients who “enter a world of paperwork so surreal that it belongs in one of Kafka’s tales of the triumph of faceless bureaucracies.” — location: [4418](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000Q9IU7U&location=4418) ^ref-19410

The propaganda image is that the retirement of the “baby boomers” is going to crash the system; as repeatedly pointed out, their retirement had already been financed by the Greenspan-led increase in payroll taxes in 1983. That aside, the boomers were once children, and had to be cared for then as well. And we find that during those years there was a sharp increase in spending for education and other child care needs. There was no crisis. If American society was able to take care of the boomers from ages zero to twenty, there can be no fundamental reason why a much richer society, with far higher output per worker, cannot take care of them from ages sixty-five to ninety. — location: [4450](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000Q9IU7U&location=4450) ^ref-62697

Social Security is based on the idea that it is a community responsibility to ensure that the disabled widow on the other side of town has food to eat, or that the child across the street should be able to go to a decent school.

we cannot be very confident about the state of public opinion on such matters because of another feature of the democratic deficit: the topics scarcely enter into public discussion and the basic facts are little known.
