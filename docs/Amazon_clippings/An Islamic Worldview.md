## Highlights
If one person is killed in west, there is such a big hue and cry while millions die in Muslim countries and nobody cares as if their lives are not as precious as the lives of westerners. This discrimination violates the basic tenet of Islam that killing of one person is like killing of the whole humanity. — location: [214](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07257N5J8&location=214) ^ref-42233

In addition to stories of Muslim heroes (here again a start has been made by a number of biographies of Syed Ahmed Shaheed), we need to have a realistic history of colonialism. The flattering self-portrait of Western Civilization, with a depiction of colonization as a noble effort to spread the benefits of their advanced civilization to primitive peoples, needs to be questioned. — location: [488](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07257N5J8&location=488) ^ref-54594

Non-Muslim Struggles Against Oppression: Another category of literature and history, which needs to be assimilated into the Islamic worldview is the so-called postcolonial literature. — location: [503](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07257N5J8&location=503) ^ref-23696
