You know you cannot reason with an irrational person. You don’t react defensively. Instead, you respond with disbelief. Here are some suggestions: • “What?” • “What did you say?” • “Did you just tell me what I am?” — location: [323](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0063HY5M8&location=323) ^ref-64310

Don’t define you and your inner world • Ask you about you, rather than only talk about themselves • Share themselves with you rather than remain secretive • Are spontaneous, not compulsive • Are calm, not angry • Are conversational, not silent • Are expressive, not stilted • Express empathy and understanding, not anger • Apologize if they make a mistake, not blame you — location: [446](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0063HY5M8&location=446) ^ref-22552

If you find yourself going over conversations and trying to figure out why the abuser didn’t really understand how you felt, it is because he couldn’t. — location: [494](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0063HY5M8&location=494) ^ref-28280

Verbal abuse, covertly or overtly, defines a person’s very being. People who are defined negatively from birth on suffer tremendously, although as a child they may adapt to, and normalize, everything happening to them. They may, then, as adults, be depressed and confused. They may not even realize that they are being verbally abused nor how it is impacting them. A person who has been slammed with verbal abuse may feel like giving up, like dying. Their emotional pain and mental anguish may be so great they self-medicate with drugs or alcohol. They may have had no name for what they suffered. — location: [686](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0063HY5M8&location=686) ^ref-21785

---
the difference between a partner who stays in an abusive relationship for years and one who leaves in the first few years is their childhood experience. If the partner grew up in an abusive family atmosphere, the partner will be inclined to endure the abuse longer. Everything is their fault, they learn from infancy on. — location: [773](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0063HY5M8&location=773) ^ref-65224

---
“They don’t have to learn anything to look good to others. They look good to others because their lost self is not projected into others. The other person is not ‘the rest of’ them.” — location: [863](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0063HY5M8&location=863) ^ref-55257
