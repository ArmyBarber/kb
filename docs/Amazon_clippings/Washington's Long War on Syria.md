## Highlights
In place of pandering to Wall Street, Syria’s Arab nationalists sought to free Syria—and as an ultimate goal, the entire Arab world—from the political and economic agendas of foreign powers. — location: [99](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=99) ^ref-59464

This is not to suggest that a cabal of rich capitalists secretly meets to dictate policy prescriptions to the U.S. government. Instead, the business community takes advantage of a multitude of mechanisms to ensure its policy preferences prevail in competition with other groups. — location: [175](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=175) ^ref-37470

---
The United States, accordingly, embarked on a decades-long campaign of invasions and economic warfare to drive Iraq’s experiment in Arab nationalism into ruin, and eventually to purge the state of its secular Arab nationalist influence. — location: [246](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=246) ^ref-27512

political Islam of revolutionary Iran, to which the Arab nationalists of the Syrian state were allied as a consequence of sharing with Iran’s Islamic Revolution three core values: a commitment to freeing the Middle East from Western domination; an implacable opposition to the colonial settlement of Palestine (a country, which, from the perspective of Syria’s ruling Arab nationalists, was Arab, and from the vantage point of Iran’s Islamists, was Muslim); and a state-directed model of economic development. — location: [308](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=308) ^ref-8427

---
Wahhabism, unlike the Muslim Brotherhood movement and Iranian Islamic Revolution, was not a reaction to Western domination. Wahhabism arose in the eighteenth century as a viciously sectarian, fundamentalist interpretation of Islam, unrelated to the Arab and Muslim world’s encounter with European colonialism. — location: [330](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=330) ^ref-4241

---
One way to blunt the appeal of Iran’s Islamic Revolution to Arabs and Muslims, most of whom were Sunni, was to foster anti-Shi’a animosity. Galvanized by animus of Shi’a “apostates,” Islamic State spent a good deal of its energies attacking Shi’a targets. — location: [356](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=356) ^ref-5814

Alawites had historically faced discrimination from Syria’s Sunni majority. As a consequence, they were attracted to political parties which were explicitly secular and anti-sectarian and which sought to overcome the Arab world’s religious divisions. — location: [369](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=369) ^ref-33517

---
both the Syrian officer corps and Ba’ath party came to have a disproportionally strong representation of Alawites (along with members of other religious minorities) and a disproportionally weak representation of Sunnis. — location: [375](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=375) ^ref-49852

---
Assad led a second coup, this time against his former comrades, which he styled a “correction.” Assad resolved to take the country in a less hardline leftist direction than his now erstwhile comrades had taken it, largely because he believed the government’s policies had alienated a large part of the population. Conservative Muslims needed to be won over by persuasion, not force, and a go-slow approach was, in his view, called for. — location: [380](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=380) ^ref-50439

---
appointees to top security positions were Alawites. They weren’t Alawite because Assad chose them on the basis of their religious identity, but because he chose them on the basis of their kinship and amity ties. The over-representation of Alawites in key state security positions, then, was a concomitant, or epiphenomenon, of Assad’s decision to surround himself with trusted intimates, — location: [386](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=386) ^ref-26324

---
Accusing the Ba’ath Party of being an instrument of the Alawite community was tantamount to accusing the mid-twentieth century U.S. Communist Party of pursuing a Jewish agenda because Jews were over-represented in the party relative to their numbers in the U.S. population. — location: [392](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=392) ^ref-31146

propagation of the myth of sectarian warfare comported with the predilection of Western discourse for Orientalist depictions of the Global South — location: [401](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=401) ^ref-7685

---
the myth of the Assad government as an Alawite instrument of oppression concealed the central role that secular Arab nationalism played in the Middle East and in the politics of the Assad government. This obfuscated the true dimensions of the conflict. — location: [407](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=407) ^ref-29378

---
Acknowledging the ideological framework within which the Syrian government operated, rather than presenting Syrian leaders as motivated by a lust for power to advance a sectarian agenda on behalf of the Alawite minority, would have presented Syria’s Arab nationalists as rational actors pursuing what many may have considered defensible, if not praiseworthy, goals. — location: [411](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=411) ^ref-49357

Iran’s revolutionaries defined Iran’s private sector as subordinate and subservient to the state sector—an anathema from the perspective of Washington’s Wall Street-defined economic orthodoxy. — location: [427](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=427) ^ref-35377

The sanctions led to the deaths of more Iraqis, observed the Muellers, than all the deaths attributable to the use of weapons of mass destruction throughout history. — location: [454](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=454) ^ref-22153

---
Many peace activists embraced sanctions as an alternative to the soldier’s business, viewing them erroneously, not as a form of warfare, with destructive consequences as great if not greater than pushing or throwing pieces of metal at the enemy, but as peaceful coercion. — location: [459](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=459) ^ref-10335

the U.S. war on Syria began long ago, before 2011. It began the moment Arab nationalists came to power in Damascus, proclaiming a motto they were determined would guide their efforts to liberate the Arab world from its centuries of domination by outside powers. — location: [466](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=466) ^ref-29710

independent, united Arab state through public ownership and planning—that is, via socialism, a concept which stirred deep antipathy on Wall Street and therefore at the U.S. State Department, where Wall Street’s influence was strong. — location: [480](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=480) ^ref-50589

As a collection of individual states, each with its own local concerns and each seeking to safeguard its own autonomy, the countries of the Arab nation would forever work at cross-purposes and would never be able to achieve the coordination and unity necessary to muster a serious challenge to their domination by Europe. — location: [496](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=496) ^ref-54861

Why had seven Arab states been unable to defeat Zionist forces in the 1947-1948 war? Answer: Because there were seven Arab states. — location: [500](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=500) ^ref-41451

while the Palestinians had begun to think of themselves in national terms, this was only one of several overlapping identities, which included identities related to being members of Greater Syria and beyond that, a greater Arab nation, as well as religious, local and familial identities.” — location: [514](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=514) ^ref-41602

Aflaq was a Christian and al-Bitar a Sunni Muslim, both of whom viewed sectarianism as the very antithesis of the party’s raison d’être; — location: [523](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=523) ^ref-52329

Arab socialism was defined as state planning, that is, direction and control of the economy in order to overcome the Arab world’s colonial legacy of underdevelopment. — location: [536](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=536) ^ref-56886

For Ba’athists, the enemy was Western imperialism and its instruments, including Israel, the Jewish settler state in Palestine, and Washington’s Arab client states, Saudi Arabia among the most important. — location: [540](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=540) ^ref-34617

While considering client states as enemies may bring thoughts of open hostility to fellow Muslims, the role those client states play result in just that

Western leaders spoke often of their vision of a political transition in Syria toward a pluralistic, democratic state, obfuscating the reality that pluralism and an elected legislature had been parts of Syrian political life for decades. — location: [594](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=594) ^ref-43944

One divide and rule practice was to transmute politically insignificant ethno-sectarian divisions within a community into significant ones by establishing quotas for political office based on ethno-sectarian identity. — location: [607](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=607) ^ref-15314

A majority of Iraqis were opposed to Bremer’s plan. A September 2003 poll found that only 29 percent of the country’s citizens agreed that it was important that their political leaders represent their sect. — location: [632](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=632) ^ref-28894

the difference between presidential elections in Syria, under its 1973 constitution, and the United States today, is that presidential candidates in the former were chosen by Arab nationalists to carry out the country’s Arab nationalist mission, while in the latter, the candidates are chosen by the U.S. capitalist class to carry out the country’s capitalist-based imperialist mission. — location: [679](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=679) ^ref-28328

What this criticism ignored was that all religious minority communities in Syria enjoyed improved standards of living under the Ba’athists, because members of these communities belonged to the class of poor, rural, laborers who the Ba’athists’ socialist policies targeted for uplift. — location: [696](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=696) ^ref-48001

By exploiting open society guarantees of civil and political liberties, such as freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and freedom of the press, proxies of foreign countries, or indigenous forces which lacked commitment to the national independence project, would be able to organize opposition to the goal of asserting national self-determination. — location: [734](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=734) ^ref-2091

The fear of falling into what they call neo-colonialism is always present. Hence, opposition to the dominant party appears to be, and sometimes actually is, destructive of the chances of nationhood. In such circumstances, opposition appears as treason against the nation. — location: [748](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=748) ^ref-34733

---
in a newly-independent underdeveloped country there are strong inherent pressures against a liberal-democratic system. The pressure militates not only against a competitive party system, but also against maintenance of realistic civil liberties. — location: [752](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=752) ^ref-19785

---
It is not unusual to hear of the non-liberal, single-party state of post-colonial societies as a form of government that springs from revolutionary leaders’ lust for power, rather than from the logic of the circumstances in which revolutionaries find themselves. This fits an ubiquitous discourse which holds all revolutionaries to be dictators in embryo. — location: [756](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=756) ^ref-8943

totalitarianism is the ideology of total war; in other words, that totalitarianism is not inherent in ideology but political circumstances.21 Governments become totalitarian in times of grave crisis, no matter what their political stripe. — location: [760](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=760) ^ref-8056

By 1921, the Bolsheviks had abandoned their initial tolerance of a multi-party arrangement in favor of a one-party state. Why? Ideology was not the reason. The structural logic of the Bolshevik’s situation was. — location: [768](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=768) ^ref-41062

---
What the propagandists failed to mention was that non-liberal one-party states arose as adaptations to enormous political challenges which required strong leadership and unity of purpose; that communist and post-colonial states had to fight for their lives against the fierce opposition of the Great Powers; and that when Washington itself faced even less formidable dangers it regularly shed its liberal and democratic institutions. — location: [786](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=786) ^ref-63276

Even in our day, the sequel to the attack of 11 September 2001 was the opening of a concentration camp at Guantanamo, where detainees have been imprisoned without trial, and without even being informed of a specific charge, regardless of age. — location: [794](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=794) ^ref-54044

In both world wars the United States faced neither the threat of nuclear annihilation nor a realistic threat of invasion, and certainly did not face the hostility of a country stronger than it militarily by many orders of magnitude. — location: [803](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=803) ^ref-45380

---
the threats faced by the United States in two world wars and after 9/11, no matter how grave they were, were less minatory than the threats which Arab nationalist Syria faced. All the same, U.S. presidents assumed virtual dictatorial powers in both WWI and WWII, and strengthened the United States’ police state powers in response to the 9/11 attacks. — location: [805](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=805) ^ref-53585

there are generally two kinds of ways in which democracy has been defined: as a set of procedures for electing candidates to public office, or as a type of society. — location: [815](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=815) ^ref-18563

---
Today, democracy, as a set of procedures for electing people to public office, is lionized by the capitalist elite of the liberal democratic world, though it’s very unlikely that capitalists would welcome democracy as real, genuine rule by the masses, in which decision-making is aimed at promoting and defending the interests of the rabble — location: [822](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=822) ^ref-16404

The capitalist elite embraces democracy in the first sense (a set of procedures), and deplores it in the second (a type of society). — location: [825](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=825) ^ref-3452

---
Within a capitalist framework, democracy as a set of procedures for electing representatives does not translate into democracy as a type of society in which average citizens and mass-based interest groups have decisive influence over government policy. — location: [835](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=835) ^ref-48631

The survival of Ba’athism as a movement of Arab national liberation now demanded flexibility. Accordingly, the Ba’athists made a number of concessions that were neither superficial nor partial. — location: [871](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=871) ^ref-23407

---
By making these concessions, the Ba’athist government was delivering the multi-party democracy that Western state officials and media said (erroneously it turned out) protesters had clamored for. — location: [879](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=879) ^ref-33295

---
the insurgency intensified, as outside powers—Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey—poured money into it. The insurgents rejected the reforms, explaining that they had arrived too late. Yet the date the reforms were implemented hardly made them less desirable or significant. — location: [882](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=882) ^ref-54134

---
Washington, London and Paris also dismissed the Syrian government’s concessions. The concessions were “meaningless,” they said, but did not explain why. — location: [884](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=884) ^ref-48639

The only people who knew what had sparked the demonstrations were the demonstrators themselves.

nor was the difficulty that the Ba’athists’ reforms weren’t democratic enough.

Ba’athist Iraq illustrated an Arab nationalist truth which Washington did not want publicized.

Washington’s assigning Syria to the company of countries in which it sought regime change, a full decade before the Arab Spring uprising, is evidence that the March 2011 disturbances, or more precisely, Damascus’s response to them, did not precipitate Washington’s decision to topple the Syrian government. — location: [1662](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=1662) ^ref-20022

The second view, which is clearly untenable, is that the protests were non-violent.

The moderate rebel was a myth. The insurgency was continuous with an Islamist rebellion that had broken out the moment secular Arab nationalists came to power in Damascus in 1963.

While Iran was an Islamic republic, and Arab nationalist Syria, Libya, and Iraq were secular, they were all alike in having constitutions which committed their respective states to act in three broad areas: promoting unity; achieving independence from foreign influence; and using the levers of the state to direct economic development to overcome the colonial legacy of under-development and provide for the common welfare of their citizens. — location: [2416](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XS1MM93&location=2416) ^ref-35953

It seems unlikely that Tehran would have provided anywhere near the same level of support for non-Muslims who had been displaced by settlers colonizing territory outside the Islamic world.

citizens are more likely to mount opposition to domestic policy that is hostile to their interests (because they’re more likely to see and feel and understand it) than to foreign policy (whose effects are often distant and indirect and difficult to discern).
