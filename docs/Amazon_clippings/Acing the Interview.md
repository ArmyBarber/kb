## Highlights
They care about what they need and only what you need to an extent that you could help them get what they want. This mindset also will empower you to ask better questions. — location: [457](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009RQGW64&location=457) ^ref-34790

The idea is to call a hiring authority with “pain” … the personal need to hire someone. — location: [568](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009RQGW64&location=568) ^ref-55671

If you simply call and ask for an interview without giving specific features, advantages, and benefits to the prospective employer, you won’t get to first base. — location: [788](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009RQGW64&location=788) ^ref-54787

---
briefly and succinctly tell a hiring authority your personal features and advantages so that they can be perceived as benefits to the hiring authority’s company. The question is, and always will be, on the part of that a hiring authority, “Why should I hire you?” — location: [800](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009RQGW64&location=800) ^ref-506

---
the purpose of this statement is to intrigue a hiring authority enough to want to interview you. — location: [809](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009RQGW64&location=809) ^ref-30772

---
“Could I see you tomorrow morning or would tomorrow afternoon be better?” — location: [812](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009RQGW64&location=812) ^ref-774

state, “Based on what we’ve talked about here, I am a great match for this job.

asking the cold, aggressive question of “What do I need to do to get the job?” or “When can I go to work?” — location: [939](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009RQGW64&location=939) ^ref-43767

---
If the hiring authority communicates that “the company prides itself in retaining employees who work together as a family,” you will want to communicate a cooperative, consultative, and collaborative style about yourself. If the hiring authority communicates that “life is a bitch and then you die,” you might want to communicate that you are a “survivor” — location: [1034](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009RQGW64&location=1034) ^ref-1156

---
If you bring up why you left in positive terms—even if it wasn’t under the most positive circumstances, i.e., you were fired—the whole scenario has a tendency to be more palatable to a hiring authority. — location: [1136](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009RQGW64&location=1136) ^ref-30244

you have to put your present or previous employers in a positive light.

“The people I have worked for in the last two jobs thought I was underqualified before they hired me. But I performed very well on both.

---
“All of the organizations that I am talking to are quality firms with quality people just like this one. All of the positions that I am interviewing for have their strengths and weaknesses.

getting mad or angry doesn’t help solve the immediate problem. I don’t think any of us perform well under the emotional stress of anger.” — location: [2015](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009RQGW64&location=2015) ^ref-24683

---
A “high level of commitment” means something that is well beyond the call of duty. Have a good story ready and make sure that it communicates how you really went the extra mile. — location: [2137](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009RQGW64&location=2137) ^ref-9996

saying anything negative or disparaging about the company that you are presently with, or are leaving, is not going to do you well.

“I really love the company that I work for, and I have done well by them. They have been very good to me and I really appreciate that. But in the position I am in now, I am not as challenged, nor can I contribute as much as I could in the position we’re discussing here at your firm. — location: [2267](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009RQGW64&location=2267) ^ref-26354

“While you are correct that I’ve had three very short stints in my employment, there are two things that are very important. First of all, I realize that someone like you is going to look at this as a liability. I don’t like it any better than anyone else; in fact, it has really concerned me. I made a couple of mistakes in taking several of those positions, and if knew then what I know now, I would never have done that. The truth is, however, that I really learned from the mistake. The fact that I’ve had three relatively short positions is one of the very reasons I can guarantee stability. I cannot very well afford another short stint at a job, so I am being very careful about the job I take. Whoever hires me is going to get a passionate and committed employee for at least seven years. — location: [2275](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009RQGW64&location=2275) ^ref-13708

to address it, make it to be as much of a positive as you possibly can, ask for understanding and empathy, then shut up. — location: [2286](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009RQGW64&location=2286) ^ref-19721

When the employment economy is more difficult and there are many candidates to choose from, most hiring authorities are more concerned about the reasons you might have left your last employer or why you’re looking to leave your present one. No — location: [2365](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009RQGW64&location=2365) ^ref-16493

first, don’t mention how much they appreciate the job they had or presently have and then, second, talk about selfish, or self-centered, “me” reasons for either leaving or changing jobs. — location: [2369](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009RQGW64&location=2369) ^ref-5312

anything related to your needs, before the needs of the company you were with, will destroy you. — location: [2371](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009RQGW64&location=2371) ^ref-5224

“You know, I really loved that job for _________ and really appreciated all of the people who I was working with. Unfortunately, the company had to downsize because of the economy and since I was one of the last hired, I was one of the first to go.” — location: [2374](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009RQGW64&location=2374) ^ref-1245

---
Unfortunately, I have reached a point with my position that the opportunity for me to grow both personally and professionally just isn’t there. — location: [2376](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009RQGW64&location=2376) ^ref-28080

---
If the answer to this question makes you look like a dedicated, committed, reasonably well-performing employee, who for very good business reasons is looking for a job, you’ll be fine. If your answer does anything less than that, you’re dead in the water. — location: [2385](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009RQGW64&location=2385) ^ref-33463

Hopefully, if you were in a position to be fired, you got your most recent organization to lay you off rather than fire you. — location: [2464](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009RQGW64&location=2464) ^ref-57455

say, “I really love that company and I was there for a reasonably long time. I performed well, but there came a time for us (the company and me) to make a change.” — location: [2487](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009RQGW64&location=2487) ^ref-43183

---
If there’s no way of avoiding having to say that you were fired, simply acknowledge that you were: that you really enjoyed the time you were at that particular organization; that you learned from that organization and appreciated all that they did for you; and that it was simply time to make a change. — location: [2493](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009RQGW64&location=2493) ^ref-10663

---
pretty sure that a prospective employer is going to find out that you were fired rather than laid off, the best thing to do is to explain exactly what happened in your opinion. — location: [2502](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009RQGW64&location=2502) ^ref-57045

---
Communicate the idea that although you don’t agree with the decision, you do respect it. In order to overcome the situation where you were fired with cause (and there is no way around having to talk about it in the interview), you are going to have to “counter” being fired with excellent references. — location: [2504](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009RQGW64&location=2504) ^ref-2493

Simply state, “That’s very interesting, I’m going to do more research on it myself.” — location: [2547](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009RQGW64&location=2547) ^ref-35197

hard work, determination, passion, and willingness to go the extra mile will do. — location: [2580](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009RQGW64&location=2580) ^ref-26451

you always want to communicate a high energy level. You do that by sitting up and leaning forward with relaxed intensity. — location: [2584](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009RQGW64&location=2584) ^ref-62204

---
Describe your day by making sure you are up and at your job very early, getting a lot of work done, i.e., undertaking lots of activity, and going home later than most people. You have to communicate doing a lot of work and doing it quickly. — location: [2586](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009RQGW64&location=2586) ^ref-36202

You should be able to relate a good story here. One or two situations where you performed well under extreme pressure will do. — location: [2607](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009RQGW64&location=2607) ^ref-37052

“My experience has been that if companies can find equal candidates internally and externally, they should be hiring internally. But I have also found that hiring externally brings new blood, new ideas, and energy to the organization, and it usually works out very well,” — location: [2635](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009RQGW64&location=2635) ^ref-11621

combining earnings with job performance is the most important thing you can do. Something along the lines of, “Well, I have found that the better job I do, the harder I work, recognition, advancement, and, especially, money usually take care of themselves.” — location: [2793](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009RQGW64&location=2793) ^ref-46553

The better you sell yourself in the interviewing process, the more a company likes you and wants to hire you, the more leverage you have in negotiation. — location: [2829](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009RQGW64&location=2829) ^ref-3646

If you approach the negotiation as though it is just part of the other conversations, you are much more likely to do well. — location: [2836](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009RQGW64&location=2836) ^ref-9706

when you go in to negotiate, if you don’t already have a crystal clear understanding of the job, get one! — location: [2841](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009RQGW64&location=2841) ^ref-55412

You have to say, in the beginning of the conversation, “Mr. or Ms. Hiring Authority, I really want this job and I want to work for you. I would like to see if we can work the money out together.” — location: [2842](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009RQGW64&location=2842) ^ref-38897

if you are being interviewed by a person who does not have direct, personal responsibility for the job—i.e., the hiring authority—you are being interviewed by someone who is more concerned with how he or she appears as a screener than finding the best candidate. — location: [3124](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009RQGW64&location=3124) ^ref-19105

Why did you come to work here? People love to talk about themselves. It is a great way to break the ice and get them to talk. — location: [3141](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009RQGW64&location=3141) ^ref-52616

Why do you like working here? Notice the metaphors. This question gets people to talk again and tells you about them. It gets the spotlight off of you. — location: [3142](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009RQGW64&location=3142) ^ref-65368
