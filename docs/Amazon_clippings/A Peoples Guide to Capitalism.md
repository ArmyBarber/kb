“The starting point of the development that gave rise both to the wage-laborer and to the capitalist was the enslavement of the worker. The advance made consisted of a change in the form of this servitude, in the transformation of feudal exploitation into capitalist exploitation.” — location: [351](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08DCN3RBW&location=351) ^ref-58294

While in 1973, David McNally explained, “financial returns made up just 16 percent of total profits in the American economy—a level that remained steady until the mid-1980s,” by 2007, “financial gains had soared to fully 41 percent of all US profits: And because these profits derive overwhelmingly from loans, their stupendous rise could only mean one thing: mounting levels of indebtedness throughout the economy… from slightly more than $10 trillion [in 1987] to $43 trillion [in 2005].” — location: [4046](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08DCN3RBW&location=4046) ^ref-63267
