## Highlights
According to al-Ghazzali, our firm and certain belief in the Oneness of God should lead us—as it did Prophet Muhammad—to the following beliefs: (i) The belief that everything happens for a reason. We look for the good and positive in whatever happens. (ii) The belief that there is no such thing as failure, only results or outcomes. — location: [200](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JZTCW8&location=200) ^ref-47642

---
The belief that we must take responsibility for whatever happens. No matter what happens, know and believe that we are in charge. — location: [206](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JZTCW8&location=206) ^ref-60791

---
The belief that we need to learn from other people who are our greatest resource. — location: [209](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JZTCW8&location=209) ^ref-16335

The belief that we need to challenge our profession or line of work and excel in it. Explore new ways of doing things. Increase our sense of curiosity and vitality. — location: [211](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JZTCW8&location=211) ^ref-38171

The belief that there is no success without commitment. — location: [213](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JZTCW8&location=213) ^ref-7350

In this relationship and all others, our state of mind is important because that determines our emotion and our emotion determines how many resources are available to us. — location: [241](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JZTCW8&location=241) ^ref-13449

---
One of the best methods which al-Ghazzali uses over and over again in the Alchemy is that of what is today called reframing: changing the way we evaluate what something means. — location: [250](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JZTCW8&location=250) ^ref-62527

---
we need to become resourceful, to realize that nothing has power over us but the power we give it by our own conscious thoughts. — location: [252](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JZTCW8&location=252) ^ref-1872

---
We learn to change the way we represent a situation so we feel differently about it. Now we are at the level of choice instead of reaction. By learning to reframe, we change our emotions so that they empower us. — location: [256](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JZTCW8&location=256) ^ref-24736

The unseemliness of each power has two aspects: one is that which arises from an excess which is too strong, the other from an insufficiency which is a deficit. — location: [605](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JZTCW8&location=605) ^ref-51352

---
When it is in balance—not too much or too little—it is called courage. Courage gives rise to nobility, high-mindedness, bravery, mildness, patience, moderation, control of anger, and characteristics like these. — location: [610](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JZTCW8&location=610) ^ref-21353

---
When it is in balance, it is called chasteness. From it, come modesty, contentment, patience, tolerance, grace, wit, and approval. — location: [615](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JZTCW8&location=615) ^ref-4734

---
Everything is overcome by its contrary, just as the treatment of an illness that causes heat is the consumption of cold (foods). The treatment of every illness that arises from anger is patience. The treatment of whatever arises from arrogance is humility. The treatment of whatever arises from miserliness is giving away wealth. The same (rule) is valid for all. — location: [677](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JZTCW8&location=677) ^ref-23263

the beginning of all (spiritual) happiness is taking pains in (the performance of) good deeds. — location: [736](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JZTCW8&location=736) ^ref-48635

“It is a cause for thanks when peace is made with a person who deserves Fire with ashes.” — location: [920](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JZTCW8&location=920) ^ref-24421

---
They are the qualities of persons who, by self-discipline, have totally cleansed themselves of the qualities of (their) human nature and see nothing except God Most High. Whatever they see, they see as from Him. A person who, because of his self, does not see this, nor any little thing resembling it, must not deceive himself and suppose himself to have a good character. Peace! — location: [940](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JZTCW8&location=940) ^ref-25446

Whosoever’s pleasure is derived from people will not reach God. — location: [1050](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JZTCW8&location=1050) ^ref-53590

Hunger closes the way of Satan, sleeping little illuminates the soul, silence keeps the soul from the distraction of talk, and seclusion turns away the darkness of people from him and closes the way to the eyes and ears. Sahl Tustari (R) says: “The saints who have become saints became so by seclusion, hunger, silence, and wakefulness.” — location: [1084](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JZTCW8&location=1084) ^ref-4709
