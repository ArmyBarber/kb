It is only in failed settler colonies, such as South Africa, Algeria, and Zimbabwe, where colonists were relatively few and Indigenous societies and economies robust, that Indigenes have regained political independence. — location: [632](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09S5NR7VD&location=632) ^ref-23434

James Belich justifiably describes settlers as “dangerous people, especially when in full-frothing boom frenzy.” — location: [671](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09S5NR7VD&location=671) ^ref-52684

---
Settler obsession with the elimination of the native has been propelled by the inescapable reality that the very existence of the Indigene challenges the legitimacy of the settler regime. — location: [792](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09S5NR7VD&location=792) ^ref-61459

The narrative that successful settler projects across the globe have propagated can be summarized as: “We made the land productive through hard work and enterprise, and the land, in turn, remade us. We are as good as Indigenous.” — location: [805](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09S5NR7VD&location=805) ^ref-36409

Perpetrators of exterminatory violence generally act in groups and usually with the sanction of their broader societies or sections of it. As such they share ideas about their motives and the necessity for resorting to final solutions to a perceived social or political problem. Ideologies, moreover, are important enablers of mass violence to the extent that they help perpetrators overcome taboos against taking human life, help mobilize sympathizers to their cause, and provide ready-made justifications for violence. — location: [4358](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09S5NR7VD&location=4358) ^ref-7336

In terms of this deeply rooted conviction, many land-hungry settlers believed that they had a right, even an obligation, to appropriate Indigenous land because they were supposedly able to make better use of it. — location: [4376](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09S5NR7VD&location=4376) ^ref-10528

Settlers across the globe, and very often the colonial establishments that supported them, had little difficulty justifying the killing of Indigenous women and children as well, and did so in remarkably similar fashion, claiming that the women bred bandits and that children grew up to become enemies. — location: [4404](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09S5NR7VD&location=4404) ^ref-700

---
righteous violence is particularly pernicious as perpetrators feel little, if any, remorse and are motivated by what they regard to be honorable goals. This is amply reflected in the mythologies and manifest destinies that settler societies have constructed to justify their existence, their acquisition of the land, and treatment of Indigenous peoples. — location: [4437](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09S5NR7VD&location=4437) ^ref-64942

We who live in the present did not create the violence and hatred of the past. But the violence and hatred of the past, to some degree created us. It formed the material world and the ideas with which we live, and will continue to do so unless we take active steps to unmake their consequences. — location: [4455](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09S5NR7VD&location=4455) ^ref-29538
