Mutazila scholar took on an intimidated representative of the embattled Sunnis on the issue of whether man brings about his own actions (the Mutazila stance) or whether God does (the Sunni one). When the Sunni let his arm dangle at the elbow and asked, ‘Who is moving this?’ – he expected the answer to be God – the Mutazila responded, ‘Someone whose mother is a whore.’ The caliph approved. — location: [1172](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00M80KZ64&location=1172) ^ref-63210

Confronting the Kharijite rebels, who based their violent claims on what the Qur’an ‘said,’ Ali alerted them that ‘This Qur’an is but lines written between two covers, it does not speak, rather it is but men who speak for it.’ — location: [1925](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00M80KZ64&location=1925) ^ref-63566

‘No compulsion in religion’ (2:256) was a Qur’anic command revealed in Medina when a child from one of the Muslim families who had been educated in the town’s Jewish schools decided to depart with the Jewish tribe being expelled from Medina. His distraught parents were told by God and the Prophet in this verse that they could not compel their son to stay. The verse, however, has been understood over the centuries as a general command that people cannot be forced to convert to Islam. — location: [2093](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00M80KZ64&location=2093) ^ref-34503

The Sufi jurist Sha‘rani considered all four Sunni madhhabs to be one great school of law, offering each believer a range of positions on any issue and thus the choice between relaxed or more stringent rules on any one issue. — location: [2306](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00M80KZ64&location=2306) ^ref-7784

It is simplistic and naive to explain jihadism merely as an inevitable growth from Islam’s ‘violent’ scripture, or as no more than a miscarried interpretation triggered solely by some tragic misreading. — location: [2766](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00M80KZ64&location=2766) ^ref-6834

Muhammad declared: ‘Indeed I will expel the Jews and the Christians from the Peninsula of the Arabs so that I leave only Muslims.’ This was not accomplished until the reign of the second caliph, Umar, who acted on the Prophet’s order and expelled the Jews of the oasis of Khaybar, north of Medina, from the Hejaz. — location: [2776](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00M80KZ64&location=2776) ^ref-33897

Ibn Taymiyya and his disciple Ibn Qayyim had argued that the Qur’anic equation of two women to one man pertained only to notarizing a loan, not bearing witness in court.

Even as late as the nineteenth century, societies in which the vast majority of the population worked the land in small agricultural communities (‘peasant’ societies) were generally characterized by marriage ages that we would consider extremely young. — location: [3140](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00M80KZ64&location=3140) ^ref-24569

They could find no effective deterrent in the practices of the Shariah courts because the evidentiary standards needed to amputate a thief’s hand were so strict that this punishment was unrealistic, and the discretionary punishment (ta‘zir) that Shariah judges would usually mete out instead were limited by Hadiths to only ten lashes. — location: [3293](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00M80KZ64&location=3293) ^ref-20122

Ironically, with all the weight and meaning that a canonical community invests in its scriptures, it is the interpreters who always matter the most. — location: [3455](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00M80KZ64&location=3455) ^ref-17754

---
In 1011, in fact, the Sunni caliph in Baghdad and the Iranian Shiite military junta that was exercising effective control over Iraq and Iran issued a rare joint manifesto.

crimes more lightly than comparable offenses all draw these laws from the Ottoman Criminal Code of 1858. It, in turn, translated this provision directly from the French Legal Code of 1810.42 — location: [3860](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00M80KZ64&location=3860) ^ref-40712

When the couple then retracted their confession, the senior Shariah judge in Cairo was sent into exile for insisting – correctly, other ulama affirmed – that the couple’s sentence had to be commuted and that ‘whoever executes them should be executed in turn.’ — location: [3894](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00M80KZ64&location=3894) ^ref-17887

A woman once rose up and interrupted the caliph Umar while he was addressing the congregation from the pulpit of the Prophets’ mosque. Far from silencing her, he admitted the mistake she had pointed out. — location: [4249](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00M80KZ64&location=4249) ^ref-27483

---
A humbling reminder of this is found in the life of Ibn Taymiyya, a learned and conservative Hanbali don but also an iconoclast unintimidated by mainstream censure. He used to admit how impressed he was by one Fatima bint Abbas (d. 1315), a female Hanbali scholar who had mastered the greatest works of law and took to the pulpits of Damascus mosques to harangue and inspire a sinful public with her preaching. Despite his respect for her, Ibn Taymiyya recalled that he had marked reservations about her speaking in the mosque pulpit. He intended to put a stop to it. Then the Prophet came to him in a dream. ‘This is a righteous woman,’ the Messenger of God counseled him. The inimitable scholar, who had stood unperturbed before sultans and had smashed idols, held his tongue. — location: [4275](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00M80KZ64&location=4275) ^ref-64156

As the immediate danger faded amid Muslim military triumph, the ulama immediately admitted Zoroastrian dualists and the polytheist pagans of India as protected ‘People of the Book’ with the right to practice their religions freely. — location: [4508](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00M80KZ64&location=4508) ^ref-2246

---
The loss of tradition had become political because, phrased differently, if the accepted framework around a discussion is removed, any claim that then assumes the presence of a framework is in actuality imposing it. This act is of political consequence in that it seeks to compel. And it is sure to be contested. — location: [4530](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00M80KZ64&location=4530) ^ref-32375

---
The universal ‘Reason’ touted by Western natural-law philosophers was an early casualty of the snapping of tradition’s last threads. Born in the rubble of postmodernity, contemporary critics of liberalism note that Reason cannot be the judge that rules impartially from outside discourse. It is part of the discourse, and any transcendent throne claimed for it is a stealthy grab for power. Stanley Fish observed that Reason(s) ‘always come from somewhere,’ and it is clear that once you have stepped outside of a tradition or leveled its authority, you cannot in fairness invoke ‘Reason’ without admitting its aims and assumptions and convincing others to accept them – precisely the unifying role that tradition used to perform. — location: [4532](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00M80KZ64&location=4532) ^ref-55425

---
In other words, if after admonishing his wife and then sleeping in a separate bed, the husband finds that she has still not rectified her behavior, he leaves the marital home entirely. This was, in fact, what Hadiths described the Prophet doing in Medina when his wives’ conduct had so disappointed him that he almost divorced them. — location: [5737](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00M80KZ64&location=5737) ^ref-2194

---
there is no such thing as ‘literal meaning’ in its usual sense of ‘what a text really says.’ We often assume that, however much we differ on interpretations, a statement or text has an obvious and objective ‘literal’ aspect that preserves an unchanging core of meaning and cannot be escaped. — location: [5770](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00M80KZ64&location=5770) ^ref-55741

---
Muslim sects agreed that the Qur’an had to be read through the prism of the Prophet’s teachings as expounded by the ulama, who then disagreed endlessly on what those teachings should be. — location: [5801](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00M80KZ64&location=5801) ^ref-32726

Darimi, a teacher of both Tirmidhi and Muslim bin Hajjaj as well as a leading early scholar in Iran, collected all the Hadiths showing Muhammad’s disapproval of beating in a chapter entitled ‘The Prohibition on Striking Women.’ — location: [5830](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00M80KZ64&location=5830) ^ref-38991

---
Just as the Hudud punishments were meant more as signs of the grievous nature of certain offenses than as sentences to be enacted, so the command to strike a wife was intended to communicate the severity of her behaving disgracefully towards her husband, not as a license for domestic abuse. — location: [5840](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00M80KZ64&location=5840) ^ref-18300

people are not all the same in how they should be disciplined. ‘A slave might be hit with a stick,’ the judge noted as an analogy, ‘while with a free man it’s enough to point it at him.’ — location: [5885](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00M80KZ64&location=5885) ^ref-30761

Scripture’s definitive interpretation often came not in legal textbooks but in the actual application of Shariah law. — location: [5946](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00M80KZ64&location=5946) ^ref-2805

---
Shariah courts in the pre-modern Muslim world were surprisingly receptive to women seeking redress or protection from spousal abuse. If it were established that violence had been done, the wife could expect judicial remedy, and the husband’s excuse for why he beat his wife did not matter. — location: [5948](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00M80KZ64&location=5948) ^ref-37834

---
If a wife was innocent of any wrongdoing, the only consequence her husband faced for declaring a Talaq was that he forfeited the dower payment he had given her (or, more frequently by the 1800s, still owed her in part) and had to pay spousal maintenance for a period of time. — location: [5959](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00M80KZ64&location=5959) ^ref-46195

In 1529, the Ottoman Shariah court in a Greek town heard the complaint of a Christian family whose daughter had been beaten to death by her husband, ultimately awarding them her wergild amount. — location: [5988](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00M80KZ64&location=5988) ^ref-48376

If neighbors claimed they heard a wife screaming but saw nothing (i.e., they could provide no evidence of abuse), the judge would still punish the husband. — location: [6003](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00M80KZ64&location=6003) ^ref-46582
