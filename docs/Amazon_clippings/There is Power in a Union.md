## Highlights
“twenty years ago ‘Abolitionist’ sounded as terrible as the word ‘Communist’ does today…. Let us not wait in this case till our tongues are tied and our hands are manacled. Let us not lie supine till our chains are forged, but let the forgers be warned and thwarted in advance.” — location: [93](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003F3PN6U&location=93) ^ref-16644
