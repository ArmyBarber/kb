One of the ways others are going to ascertain how things turned out is by how you present yourself. Are you upbeat? Do you project power and success or the reverse? This is why developing the ability to act in ways that you may not feel at the moment, described in chapter 7, is such an important skill. You want to convey that everything is fine and under your control, even under dire circumstances. — location: [2722](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003V1WSZK&location=2722) ^ref-27920

People have a heightened risk of death in the period immediately after they lose their job—and not just because of greater financial stress or the absence of medical insurance. As Michael Marmot, a British researcher on the effects of social standing on health, has written, one reason there is a connection between not working and health is because being out of work “represents loss of a social role and all the things that go with it.” — location: [2941](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003V1WSZK&location=2941) ^ref-59698

One lesson from the growing number of studies on the effects of power is how little it takes to get people into a power mind-set where they engage in all kinds of disrespectful and rude behavior. — location: [3003](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003V1WSZK&location=3003) ^ref-19108

It’s easier to lose your patience when you are in power—power leads to disinhibition, to not watching what you say and do, to being more concerned about yourself than about the feelings of others. But losing patience causes people to lose control and offend others, and that can cost them their jobs. — location: [3106](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003V1WSZK&location=3106) ^ref-63158

Companies and leaders can fail to see the changes in the social environment that can make old ways less successful than they once were. The tendency of power to diminish the power holder’s attention and sensitivity to others with less power compounds this problem. The combination of diminished vigilance and changed circumstances often leads to the loss of power. — location: [3161](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003V1WSZK&location=3161) ^ref-46399

political struggles are more likely to occur and to be more fierce and power is used more often when resources are scarcer and therefore there is more struggle over their allocation. — location: [3210](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003V1WSZK&location=3210) ^ref-44977

One implication of this phenomenon for you is that the specific organization or domain in which you rise to power may matter less than the fact that you manage to achieve high-level status someplace. — location: [3289](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003V1WSZK&location=3289) ^ref-14316

lower-power groups often developed attitudes that justified their own inferior (and others’ more favored) position, thereby contributing to the persistence of hierarchical arrangements that disadvantaged them. So, people attending a lower-status university would not bolster their university’s status compared to higher-status schools but accepted the fact of the lower status of their educational institution and the implications of that lowered status. — location: [3301](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003V1WSZK&location=3301) ^ref-45015
