## Highlights
I have worked with many survivors stranded in this form of adult helplessness. Those who recover from it typically do so by engaging extensively in the angering work of grieving that is discussed throughout this book. The ability to invoke willpower seems to be allied to your ability to healthily express your anger. With sufficient recovering, you can learn to manufacture your volition. — location: [661](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=661) ^ref-24848

---
mindfulness eventually awakens your fighting spirit to resist the abusive refrains from your childhood, and to replace them with thoughts that are self-supportive. — location: [736](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=736) ^ref-59160

---
repression of one end of the emotional continuum often leads to a repression of the whole continuum, and the person becomes emotionally deadened. — location: [758](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=758) ^ref-6962

---
The repression of the so-called negative polarities of emotion causes much unnecessary pain, as well as the loss of many essential aspects of the feeling nature. In fact, much of the plethora of loneliness, alienation, and addictive distraction that plagues modern industrial societies is a result of people being taught and forced to reject, pathologize or punish so many of their own and others’ normal feeling states. — location: [767](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=767) ^ref-62516

---
those who cannot feel their normal angry or fearful responses to abuse, are often in danger of putting up with it without protest. — location: [777](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=777) ^ref-36186

feelings of fear, shame and guilt are sometimes signs that we have said or done the right thing. They are emotional flashbacks to how we were traumatized for trying to claim normal human privileges. — location: [1435](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=1435) ^ref-42745

a powerful clue that you are in a flashback. With practice, mindfully noticing a sudden upsurge in craving can be interpreted as the need to invoke the flashback management steps.

hypervigilance typically devolves into intense performance anxiety on every level of self-expression. — location: [2612](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=2612) ^ref-60466

---
I reduce procrastination by reminding myself that I will not accept unfair criticism or perfectionist expectations from anyone. Even when afraid, I will defend myself from unfair criticism. I won’t let fear make my decisions. — location: [2673](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=2673) ^ref-7546

All this in reaction to the tiny faux pas of a spilled glass of water! — location: [2703](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=2703) ^ref-31276

---
As the quest for perfection fails over and over, and as parental acceptance and nurturing remain elusive, imperfection becomes synonymous with shame and fear. Perceived imperfection triggers fear of abandonment, which triggers self-hate for imperfection, which expands abandonment into self-abandonment. This in turn amps fear up even further, which in turn intensifies self-disgust, etc. On and on it goes in a downward spiral of fear and shame-encrusted depression. It can go on for hours, days, weeks, and for those with severe Cptsd, can become their standard mode of being. — location: [2753](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=2753) ^ref-34974

---
Permanent abandonment, public humiliation, lethal illness, lonely death, imminent attack, and penniless homelessness are common endangerment themes of many survivors. — location: [2763](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=2763) ^ref-21226

---
the critic is above all a self-perpetuating process of extreme negative noticing. Second the critic is a constant hypervigilance that sees disaster hovering in the next moment about to launch into a full-court-press. — location: [2766](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=2766) ^ref-1433

---
We can re-hijack the anger of the critic’s attack, and forcefully redirect it at the critic instead of ourselves. We can then silently and internally say “No!” or “Stop!” or “Shut Up!” to short-circuit drasticizing and perfectionistic mental processes. — location: [2773](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=2773) ^ref-16441

The most important thought correction of all is a switch in the perspective of our thinking. — location: [2868](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=2868) ^ref-2675

Chronic lateness and poor follow through on commitments can also be unconscious, passive-aggressive ways of expressing anger to others. — location: [2969](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=2969) ^ref-51525

---
I subscribe to authenticity as one of my highest values, but it does not include sharing my outer critic’s view of you or exposing my inner critic’s unfair judgments of me. — location: [2977](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=2977) ^ref-58093

---
the toxic critic is not an authentic part of us. — location: [2979](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=2979) ^ref-49530

---
When we do not resist this junk food feeding of our psyches with a news “service” that exults so thoroughly in the negative, we can be left floundering in a dreadful hypervigilance. — location: [3033](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=3033) ^ref-61462

---
In worse case scenarios, outer critic drasticizing deteriorates into paranoia. — location: [3038](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=3038) ^ref-8137

---
Cognitive work in both cases involves the demolition and rebuilding processes of thought-stopping and thought substitution, respectively. And, emotional work in both instances is grief work. It is removing the critic’s fuel supply - the unexpressed childhood anger and the uncried tears of a lifetime of abandonment. — location: [3155](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=3155) ^ref-9717

---
we can choose to face the acute pain of critic-shrinking work because we want to end the chronic pain of having the critic destroy our enjoyment of life. It is the fight of a lifetime. — location: [3172](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=3172) ^ref-27537

---
Critic management is often the primary work of early stage grief work. This work involves recognizing and challenging the ways the critic is blocking or shaming the processes of grieving. — location: [3318](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=3318) ^ref-35050

---
Self-hate is the most grievous reenactment of parental abandonment. — location: [3335](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=3335) ^ref-19549

---
When we greet our own tears with self-acceptance, crying awakens our develop- mentally arrested instinct of self-compassion. Once we establish self-compassion through consistent and repeated practice, it becomes the cornerstone of an increasing sense of self-esteem. When an attitude of self-compassion becomes habitual, it can instantly antidote the self-abandonment that so characterizes a flashback. — location: [3414](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=3414) ^ref-5452

The depth of our ability to be there for an intimate generally depends on the depth of our capacity to practice unwavering allegiance to ourselves. — location: [3418](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=3418) ^ref-38556

---
Without complete emoting of his hurt, a survivor can become stuck in moodiness. — location: [3435](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=3435) ^ref-62099

---
Blocked anger can degenerate into bitter sullenness, and blocked sadness can deteriorate into melancholic self-indulgence. — location: [3437](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=3437) ^ref-52462

---
Grieving has almost instantly delivered him from painful loss into eager apprehension of what is fun about life and what there is to look forward to. — location: [3447](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=3447) ^ref-38502

---
When we can both anger and cry while re-experiencing our early abandonment in a flashback, we can obtain a more complete release from the abandonment mélange. Each survivor does well to assess whether his angering or crying is blocked or stultified, and to then work at recovering it. — location: [3449](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=3449) ^ref-36416

As unsupported children, we have to dissociate because we are not able to effectively grieve. We have to protect ourselves by not allowing the full brunt of our pain into awareness. — location: [3507](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=3507) ^ref-35346

---
Some survivors over-rely on reasoning and lofty dialogue to protect themselves from the potentially messy and painful world of feeling. Even the highest levels of creative thinking can deteriorate into an obsessive defense when they are excessively engaged. — location: [3533](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=3533) ^ref-47884

We must repudiate this damaging legacy of the past. Verbal ventilation is the key way that people make friends. — location: [3540](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=3540) ^ref-37886

Nowhere is this truer than with mutual commiseration. Mutual commiseration is the process in which two intimates are reciprocally sympathetic to each other’s troubles and difficulties. It is the deepest most intimate channel to intimacy – profounder than sex. — location: [3549](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=3549) ^ref-10244

Feeling is a way of focusing on somatic experience that enables us to reclaim our ability to experience full, relaxed and vital inhabitancy of our bodies. — location: [3558](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=3558) ^ref-25818

---
A child who is repeatedly punished for emoting learns to be afraid of inner emotional experience and tightens [armors] the musculature of her body in an effort to hold feelings in and to banish them from awareness. — location: [3583](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=3583) ^ref-19453

As a survivor becomes more adept at angering and crying, fear of his feelings will decrease, and opportunities to learn to simply feel will present themselves. — location: [3603](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=3603) ^ref-54782

On a deeper layer, the critic is also distracting and disassociating us from our emotional pain. — location: [3700](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=3700) ^ref-15997

fear and shame dis-associate us from the bottom layer - the terrible abandonment depression itself. — location: [3701](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=3701) ^ref-65466

---
Overreaction to depression essentially reinforces learned toxic shame. It reinforces the person’s belief that he is unworthy, defective and unlovable when he is depressed. Sadly this typically drives him deeper into abandonment-exacerbating isolation. — location: [3733](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=3733) ^ref-52408

chapter. Mild sensations of fear are muscular tightness or tension anywhere in the body, especially in the alimentary canal. Tension in the jaw, throat, chest, diaphragm or belly also often correlates with fear. — location: [3744](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=3744) ^ref-19919

One of the biggest challenges of mindfully focusing on depression is to not dissociate into sleep. Sitting up straight in a comfortable chair can help to keep you awake and focused on fully feeling and metabolizing your depression. — location: [3758](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=3758) ^ref-46580

that I typically function well enough no matter how tired or introverted I feel. These days, I am sometimes even able to authentically welcome the most exhausted of these experiences as a chance to take a break from my less essential routines. I have learned how to resist my critic’s all-or-none productivity program, and be satisfied with days of getting less done. — location: [3790](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=3790) ^ref-44791

---
feeling tired is sometimes unrelated to sleep deprivation. It is instead an emotional experience of the abandonment depression. I believe that emotional tiredness comes from not resting enough in a safe relationship with yourself or with another. — location: [3807](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=3807) ^ref-5249

Step. The cyclothymic two-step is the dance of flight types or subtypes who habitually overreact to their tiredness with workaholic or busyholic activity. Self-medicating with their own adrenalin, they “run” to counteract the emotional tiredness of the unprocessed abandonment depression. Eventually however, many exhaust themselves physically, and become temporarily too depleted or sick to continue running. At such times, they collapse into an accumulated depression so painful, that they re-launch desperately into “flight-speed” at the first sign of replenished adrenalin. Survivors with this pattern sometimes misdiagnose themselves as bipolar because of their abrupt vacillations between adrenalin highs and abandonment-exacerbated lows. — location: [3813](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00HJBMDXK&location=3813) ^ref-63729
