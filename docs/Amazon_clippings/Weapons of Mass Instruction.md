## Highlights
We could encourage the best qualities of youthfulness — curiosity, adventure, resilience, the capacity for surprising insight — simply by being more flexible about time, texts, and tests, by introducing kids to truly competent adults, and by giving each student the autonomy he or she needs in order to take a risk every now and then. — location: [194](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0097DE6XI&location=194) ^ref-44941

compulsory schooling on this continent was intended to be just what it had been for Prussia in the 1820s: a fifth column into the burgeoning democratic movement that threatened to give the peasants and the proletarians a voice at the bargaining table. Modern, industrialized, compulsory schooling was to make a sort of surgical intervention into the prospective unity of these underclasses. — location: [250](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0097DE6XI&location=250) ^ref-17708

Divide children by subject, by age-grading, by constant rankings on tests, and by many other more subtle means, and it was unlikely that the ignorant mass of mankind, separated in childhood, would ever re-integrate into a dangerous whole. — location: [253](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0097DE6XI&location=253) ^ref-18975

Maturity has by now been banished from nearly every aspect of our lives. Easy divorce laws have removed the need to work at relationships; easy credit has removed the need for fiscal self-control; easy entertainment has removed the need to learn to entertain oneself; easy answers have removed the need to ask questions. — location: [305](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0097DE6XI&location=305) ^ref-24460

School trains children to be employees and consumers; teach your own to be leaders and adventurers. School trains children to obey reflexively; teach your own to think critically and independently. Well-schooled kids have a low threshold for boredom; help your own to develop an inner life so that they’ll never be bored. — location: [315](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0097DE6XI&location=315) ^ref-44970

school became an open battleground between old-fashioned, modest, reading, writing and arithmetic ambitions of historic schooling, and proponents of advanced academic thinking, located mainly in project offices of great corporate non-profit foundations like Carnegie and Rockefeller — men who worked diligently to lead institutional schooling toward a scientific rationalization of all social affairs. — location: [368](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0097DE6XI&location=368) ^ref-46927

Ninety-nine [students] out of a hundred are automata, careful to walk in prescribed paths, careful to follow the prescribed custom. This is not an accident but the result of substantial education which, scientifically defined, is the subsumption of the individual. . . . The great purpose of school [self-alienation] can be realized better in dark, airless, ugly places. . . . It is to master the physical self, to transcend the beauty of nature. School should develop the power to withdraw from the external world. — location: [526](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0097DE6XI&location=526) ^ref-28052

When you flip hamburgers, sit at a computer all day, unpack and shelve merchandise from China year after year, you manage the tedium better if you have a shallow inner life, one you can escape through booze, drugs, sex, media, or other low level addictive behaviors. Easier to keep sane if your inner life is shallow. School, thought Harris the great American schoolman, should prepare ordinary men and women for lifetimes of alienation. Can you say he wasn’t fully rational? — location: [537](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0097DE6XI&location=537) ^ref-3868

Andrew Carnegie, writing 126 years after Smith, in The Empire of Business disagreed.

the reality of mass production which could not be constrained to simply meet human demands, but instead imposed the demands of production on human wishes. Where once the conventional laws of supply and demand put the buyer in the driver’s seat, in the topsy-turvy world of financial capitalism demand had to be created for whatever could be supplied most profitably at the moment. — location: [567](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0097DE6XI&location=567) ^ref-51867

The new forced schooling octopus taught anyone unable to escape its tentacles that inert knowledge — memorizing the dots — is the gold standard of intellectual achievement. Not connecting those dots.

Any political management, even tyranny, must provide enough work for ordinary people that revolutionary conditions don’t emerge. Forced schooling provides a spectacular jobs project, one almost infinitely elastic, one expanding and contracting with employment needs. It should be no secret to you that institutional schooling, with all its outriggers, is the principal employer in the United States. — location: [664](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0097DE6XI&location=664) ^ref-11794

to produce at all in a mass production sense requires huge amounts of money to be assembled from investors for the purchase of production machinery, and for its repair and upgrading, training programs, advertising, a distribution infrastructure, and so on.

rationalized pedagogy was a natural vehicle to implant habits and attitudes to accomplish that end. Under this outlook, the classroom would never be used to produce knowledge, but only to consume it; it would not encourage the confined to produce ideas, only to consume the ideas of others.

Andrew Carnegie, one of the principal architects of the new command and control system saw its drawbacks clearly; he said it would act to some degree as an anti-meritocracy, denying a goodly number of the best quality people in every field the leadership their merit should have earned them — but on the whole Carnegie thought it was a fair bargain: exchanging merit for social stability and protection of capital. — location: [982](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0097DE6XI&location=982) ^ref-45763

highly centralized mass production economies take on the character of oligarchies, they can’t allow natural processes of capitalism to go unregulated; the creative destruction which Schumpeter saw as central to the health of market economoies can’t be allowed to occur naturally.

The opposite of mass-mindedness is dialectical-mindedness.

Complex minds are always dialectical.

Overproduction would have strangled capital accumulation by posing continuous competition — and without capital accumulation, no dominant corporations. Far from production as an ideal, it was consumption that had to be encouraged. School had to train in consumption habits: listening to others, moving on a bell or horn signal without questioning, becoming impressionable — more accurately, gullible — in order to do well on tests. — location: [1017](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0097DE6XI&location=1017) ^ref-52747

To enlist public opinion behind this utopian transformation, a pathological state of youth, heretofore unrecognized by history, was designed by G. Stanley Hall of Johns Hopkins University.

after adolescence was professionalized, a decline in the numbers of patent applications by Americans occurred.

Formulaic schooling is worthless to common citizens, even destructive. It’s only useful to policymakers and managers. It must be killed, not modified.

schooling is a matter of habit and attitude training. It takes place from the outside in.

Education must be largely self-initiated, a tapestry woven out of broad experience, constant introspection, ability to concentrate on one’s purpose in spite of distractions, a combination of curiosity, patience, and intense watchfulness, and it requires substantial trial and error risk-taking, along with a considerable ability to take feedback from the environment — to learn from mistakes. — location: [1289](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0097DE6XI&location=1289) ^ref-56257

The official economy we have constructed demands constantly renewed supplies of leveled, spiritless, passive, anxious, friendless, family- less people who can be scrapped and replaced endlessly, and who will perform at maximum efficiency until their own time comes to be scrap; people who think the difference between Coke and Pepsi, or round hamburgers versus square ones, are subjects worthy of argument. — location: [1324](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0097DE6XI&location=1324) ^ref-2840

As our economy has been shaped by its architects, it relies upon encouraging frenzy for novelty, for fashion in more than clothing, all the way to telephones.

The steep decline in common prosperity over 90 years of intense forced schooling drove both parents from the home to work, depositing their children in the management systems of daycare and extended schooling.

the poison pill in merit proposals. Merit would certainly NOT go to the meritorious — as a student, parent or citizen would define merit — but as a school administrator would. When 22% of the teachers don’t survive more than a year, the caste system that corrupts our schools is partially to blame.

If you believe nothing can be done for the dumb except kindness, because it’s biology (the bell-curve model); if you believe capitalist oppressors have ruined the dumb (the neo-Marxist model); if you believe the dumbness reflects depraved moral fiber (the Calvinist model), or is nature’s way of disqualifying boobies from the reproduction sweepstakes (the Darwinian model), or society’s way of providing someone to clean your toilet (the pragmatic-elitist model), or that it’s evidence of bad karma (the Buddhist model); if you believe any of the various explanations given for the position of the dumb in the social order, then you will be forced to concur that a vast bureaucracy is necessary to address the problem of the dumb. — location: [1657](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0097DE6XI&location=1657) ^ref-567

The country has been sold the idea Hector is the problem of modern schooling. That misperception is the demon we face, under its many guises and behind its shape-shifting rhetoric. Forced schooling itself was conceived to be the front line in a war against chaos, the beginning of the effort to keep Hector and his kind in protective custody.
