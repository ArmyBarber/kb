## Highlights
Conversely, a topic that is mystified or distorted in our history, like secession, usually signifies a continuing injustice in the present, like racism. Telling the truth about the past can help us make it right from here on. — location: [295](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DRP1GZ2&location=295) ^ref-37645

The very first thing they omit is the next point Lincoln made: “. . . I have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty, and I intend no modification of my oft-expressed personal wish that all men, everywhere could be free.” — location: [4198](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DRP1GZ2&location=4198) ^ref-38557

Saving the Union had never been Lincoln’s sole concern, as shown by his 1860 rejection of the eleventh-hour Crittenden Compromise, a constitutional amendment intended to preserve the Union by preserving slavery forever. — location: [4207](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DRP1GZ2&location=4207) ^ref-19013

history textbooks still present Union and Confederate sympathizers as equally idealistic. The North fought to hold the Union together, while the Southern states fought, according to The American Way, “for the preservation of their rights and freedom to decide for themselves.” Nobody fought to preserve racial slavery; nobody fought to end it. — location: [4423](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DRP1GZ2&location=4423) ^ref-11476
