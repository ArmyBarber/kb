## Highlights
schools are more segregated today than they were forty years ago, but this is mostly because the neighborhoods in which schools are located are so segregated. — location: [2701](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01M8IWJT2&location=2701) ^ref-5814

the United States has less mobility than many other industrialized societies. Of American children born to parents whose incomes were in the bottom income quintile, almost half (43 percent) remain trapped in the bottom quintile as adults. — location: [2776](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01M8IWJT2&location=2776) ^ref-55121

AS A NATION, we have paid an enormous price for avoiding an obligation to remedy the unconstitutional segregation we have allowed to fester. — location: [2923](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01M8IWJT2&location=2923) ^ref-61964

---
remedies are inconceivable as long as citizens, whatever their political views, continue to accept the myth of de facto segregation. — location: [2969](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01M8IWJT2&location=2969) ^ref-63007

With very rare exceptions, textbook after textbook adopts the same mythology. If middle and high school students are being taught a false history, is it any wonder that they come to believe that African Americans are segregated only because they don’t want to marry or because they prefer to live only among themselves? — location: [3002](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01M8IWJT2&location=3002) ^ref-17193
