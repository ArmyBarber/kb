## Highlights
By the time the East-West standoff that some historians had termed the “Long Peace” ended in 1991, the United States had already embarked upon a decade of unprecedented interventionism. — location: [62](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=62) ^ref-57046

---
A political elite preoccupied with the governance of empire paid little attention to protecting the United States itself. — location: [85](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=85) ^ref-36040

---
In practical terms, prior to 9/11 the mission of homeland defense was unassigned. — location: [86](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=86) ^ref-9531

---
Seeing themselves as a peaceful people, Americans remain wedded to the conviction that the conflicts in which they find themselves embroiled are not of their own making. — location: [108](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=108) ^ref-51394

---
Certain of our own benign intentions, we reflexively assign responsibility for war to others, typically malignant Hitler-like figures — location: [109](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=109) ^ref-23499

---
In our public discourse, freedom is not so much a word or even a value as an incantation, its very mention enough to stifle doubt and terminate all debate. — location: [127](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=127) ^ref-40566

---
Good fortune and a position of apparent preeminence placed the United States “under the most grievous temptations to self-adulation.” — location: [151](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=151) ^ref-48800

---
Niebuhr once wrote disapprovingly of Americans, their “culture soft and vulgar, equating joy with happiness and happiness with comfort.”9 Were he alive today, Niebuhr might amend that judgment, with Americans increasingly equating comfort with self-indulgence. — location: [168](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=168) ^ref-49924

---
The actual exercise of American freedom is no longer conducive to generating the power required to establish and maintain an imperial order. If anything, the reverse is true: Centered on consumption and individual autonomy, the exercise of freedom is contributing to the gradual erosion of our national power. — location: [177](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=177) ^ref-23106

American power has limits and is inadequate to the ambitions to which hubris and sanctimony have given rise. — location: [203](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=203) ^ref-4150

---
While the defense of American freedom seems to demand that U.S. troops fight in places like Iraq and Afghanistan, the exercise of that freedom at home undermines the nation’s capacity to fight. — location: [204](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=204) ^ref-15952

---
a state of perpetual national security emergency aggravates the disorders afflicting our political system, allowing the executive branch to accrue ever more authority at the expense of the Congress and disfiguring the Constitution. In this sense, the Long War is both self-defeating and irrational. — location: [208](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=208) ^ref-45540

---
Rather than insisting that the world accommodate the United States, Americans need to reassert control over their own destiny, ending their condition of dependency and abandoning their imperial delusions. — location: [228](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=228) ^ref-19437

Americans of an earlier generation worried about bomber and missile gaps, both of which turned out to be fictitious. The present-day gap between requirements and the means available to satisfy those requirements is neither contrived nor imaginary. It is real and growing. This gap defines the crisis of American profligacy. — location: [261](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=261) ^ref-12305

to credit the United States with possessing a “liberating tradition” is equivalent to saying that Hollywood has a “tradition of artistic excellence.” The movie business is just that—a business. Its purpose is to make money. If once in a while a studio produces a film of aesthetic value, that may be cause for celebration, but profit, not revealing truth and beauty, defines the purpose of the enterprise. Something of the same can be said of the enterprise launched on July 4, 1776. The hardheaded lawyers, merchants, farmers, and slaveholding plantation owners gathered in Philadelphia that summer did not set out to create a church. They founded a republic. Their purpose was not to save mankind. It was to ensure that people like themselves enjoyed unencumbered access to the Jeffersonian trinity. — location: [283](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=283) ^ref-27321

---
“our whole national history has been one of expansion.” TR spoke truthfully. The founders viewed stasis as tantamount to suicide. From the outset, Americans evinced a compulsion to acquire territory and extend their commercial reach abroad. How was expansion achieved? On this point, the historical record leaves no room for debate: by any means necessary. — location: [302](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=302) ^ref-62405

---
When it came to action rather than talk, even the policy makers viewed as most idealistic remained fixated on one overriding aim: enhancing American influence, wealth, and power. The record of U.S. foreign relations from the earliest colonial encounters with Native Americans to the end of the Cold War is neither uniquely high-minded nor uniquely hypocritical and exploitive. — location: [316](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=316) ^ref-325

---
The achievements of these preeminent American statesmen derived not from their common devotion to a liberating tradition but from boldness unburdened by excessive scruples. — location: [333](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=333) ^ref-40077

---
Notwithstanding the high-sounding pronouncements that routinely emanate from the White House and the State Department, the defining characteristic of U.S. foreign policy at its most successful has not been idealism, but pragmatism, frequently laced with pragmatism’s first cousin, opportunism. — location: [334](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=334) ^ref-35466

---
expansion fostered prosperity, which in turn created the environment within which Americans pursued their dreams of freedom even as they argued with one another about just who deserved to share in that dream. The promise—and reality—of ever-increasing material abundance kept that argument within bounds. — location: [349](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=349) ^ref-23761

By the end of World War II, the country possessed nearly two-thirds of the world’s gold reserves and more than half its entire manufacturing capacity.8 In 1947, the United States by itself accounted for one-third of world exports.9 Its foreign trade balance was comfortably in the black. As measured by value, its exports more than doubled its imports. — location: [363](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=363) ^ref-25672

Abundance, sustained in no small measure by a postwar presumption of American “global leadership,” made possible the expansion of freedom at home. — location: [394](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=394) ^ref-6792

Rebutting Soviet charges of racism and hypocrisy lent the promotion of freedom domestically a strategic dimension. Yet possibility only became reality thanks to progressive political activism. — location: [395](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=395) ^ref-42358

A proper understanding of contemporary history means acknowledging an ironic kinship between hard-bitten Cold Warriors like General LeMay and left-leaning feminists like Ms. Friedan. — location: [413](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=413) ^ref-58814

In the twenty years following VJ Day, wrote Maier, “Americans traded wealth for preponderance,” providing assistance to rebuild shattered economies in Western Europe and East Asia and opening up the U.S. market to their products.15 America’s postwar status as leader of the free world was bought and paid for in Washington. — location: [426](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=426) ^ref-7240

Prior to the Vietnam War, efforts to expand American power in order to promote American abundance usually proved conducive to American freedom. After Vietnam, efforts to expand American power continued; but when it came to either abundance or freedom, the results became increasingly problematic. — location: [437](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=437) ^ref-29307

---
The first protracted economic downturn since World War II confronted Americans with a fundamental choice. They could curb their appetites and learn to live within their means or deploy dwindling reserves of U.S. power in hopes of obliging others to accommodate their penchant for conspicuous consumption. — location: [454](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=454) ^ref-8270

Reagan mainly indulged American self-indulgence. — location: [594](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=594) ^ref-61497

“the most significant moral characteristic of a nation is its hypocrisy.”23 In international politics, the chief danger of hypocrisy is that it inhibits self-understanding. The hypocrite ends up fooling mainly himself. — location: [625](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=625) ^ref-61366

What we can say with certainty is that events in our own time, most notably the Iraq War, have refuted Reagan’s assurances, with fateful consequences. — location: [630](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=630) ^ref-62757

In Washington, confidence that a high-quality military establishment, dexterously employed, could enable the United States, always with high-minded intentions, to organize the world to its liking had essentially become a self-evident truth. — location: [635](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=635) ^ref-64009

In Afghanistan, jihadists took on a superpower, the Soviet Union, and won. They gained immeasurably in confidence and ambition, their efforts funded in large measure by the American taxpayer. — location: [670](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=670) ^ref-18835

---
As long as it had remained, however tenuously, within the Kremlin’s sphere of influence, Afghanistan posed no threat to the United States, just as, before 1980, the five Central Asian republics of the Soviet Union, forming a crescent north of Afghanistan, hardly registered on the Pentagon’s meter of strategic priorities (or American consciousness). — location: [685](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=685) ^ref-65258

---
In the wake of the 9/11 attacks, planned in Afghanistan, all of “Central Asia suddenly became valuable real estate to the United States.”29 In a sort of reverse domino theory, the importance now attributed to Afghanistan increased the importance of the entire region. — location: [688](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=688) ^ref-59487

Whereas expansion into the Caribbean a century ago paid economic dividends as well as enhancing U.S. security, expansion into Central Asia is unlikely to produce comparable benefits. — location: [715](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=715) ^ref-54999

By the time that Reagan retired from office, this had become the basis for national security strategy in the region. — location: [757](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=757) ^ref-3748

none of Reagan’s successors have taken any meaningful action to address this addiction. Each tacitly endorsed it, essentially acknowledging that dependence had become an integral part of American life. — location: [779](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=779) ^ref-16768

the cease-fire that terminated Operation Desert Storm in February 1991 did not end the Persian Gulf War. After a brief pause, hostilities resumed.

Yet soon after 9/11, the American people went back to business as usual—urged to do so by the president himself. “War costs money,” Franklin D. Roosevelt had reminded his countrymen after Pearl Harbor. “That means taxes and bonds and bonds and taxes. It means cutting luxuries and other non-essentials.” — location: [883](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=883) ^ref-38891

---
that way of life, based for at least two generations on an ethic of self-gratification and excess, drastically reduced the resources available for such an all-encompassing imperial enterprise. Encouraged by President Bush to attend to their personal priorities, Americans lost no time disengaging themselves from the war he had launched. — location: [913](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=913) ^ref-60525

The horrors of September 11 notwithstanding, most Americans subscribed to a limited-liability version of patriotism, one that emphasized the display of bumper stickers in preference to shouldering a rucksack. — location: [931](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=931) ^ref-24631

to put our house in order would be to open up a whole new array of options, once again permitting the United States to “choose peace or war, as our interest, guided by justice, shall counsel.” — location: [963](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=963) ^ref-41503

Truman’s successors presided over a system defined by the concentration of power, both in Washington and, within Washington, in the executive branch. To describe the result as a republic is to misconstrue the essential nature of the thing, like calling Adolf Hitler a dictator or the weapon dropped on Hiroshima a bomb. — location: [981](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=981) ^ref-60583

---
To provide a specific and execrable illustration of politics-as-theater, one need look no farther than the actions of the Democratic Party in relation to Iraq. Midterm elections in November 2006, widely seen as a referendum on the war, created a Democratic majority in both houses of Congress. The new Senate majority leader Harry Reid and the new Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi claimed that their party had a mandate to change course. “The American people made clear in last fall’s election,” Pelosi announced in early 2007, that “they want a new direction on Iraq.” She promised “tough accountability leading to the responsible redeployment of our troops.” — location: [1021](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=1021) ^ref-31784

At a time when pundits and policy makers routinely liken the threat of Islamic radicalism to the threat posed by the totalitarianisms of the last century, it is worth recalling that U.S. officials once compared the totalitarians to historic Islam. “The threat to Western Europe,” wrote Truman’s secretary of state, Dean Acheson, in his memoirs, “seemed to me singularly like that which Islam had posed centuries before, with its combination of ideological zeal and fighting power.” — location: [1110](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=1110) ^ref-34655

The ideology of national security does not serve as an operational checklist. It imposes no specific obligations.

This was a rendering of history with all the details air-brushed away—no allusions to Vietnam, no reference to CIA coups and attempted assassinations, no mention of collaborating with venal autocrats like Cuba’s Fulgencio Batista, Nicaragua’s Anastasio Somoza Debayle, or the Philippines’ Ferdinand Marcos. — location: [1146](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=1146) ^ref-55872

“At moments of great peril in the last century,” declared Senator Barack Obama,   American leaders such as Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, and John F.

the role that the ideology of national security plays in shaping electoral politics. That role is chiefly to provide a reductive and insipid, if ultimately reassuring, view of reality. Accept the proposition that America is freedom’s tribune, and it becomes a small step to believing that the “peace process” aims to achieve peace, that Iraq qualifies as a sovereign state, and that Providence has summoned the United States to wage an all-out war against “terrorism.” — location: [1172](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=1172) ^ref-31789

---
In this way, ideology serves as a device for sharply narrowing the range of policy debate. Dissent, where it exists, seldom penetrates the centers of power in Washington. Principled dissenters, whether paleoconservatives or libertarians, pacifists or neo-agrarians, remain on the political fringes, dismissed as either mean-spirited (that is, unable to appreciate the lofty motives that inform U.S. policy) or simply naive — location: [1180](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=1180) ^ref-7135

The ideology of national security persists not because it expresses empirically demonstrable truths but because it serves the interests of those who created the national security state and those who still benefit from its continued existence— — location: [1184](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=1184) ^ref-17635

---
To say that a power elite directs the affairs of state is not to suggest the existence of some dark conspiracy. It is simply to acknowledge the way Washington actually works. Especially on matters related to national security, policy making has become oligarchic rather than democratic. The policy-making process is not open but closed, with the voices of privileged insiders carrying unimaginably greater weight than those of the unwashed masses. — location: [1196](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=1196) ^ref-5833

Realpolitik leaves only limited room for consistency and high-mindedness. Yet from the late 1940s to the present day, members of the power elite have shown an almost pathological tendency to misinterpret reality and inflate threats.

The ideology of national security underwrites a bipartisan consensus that since World War II has lent to foreign policy a remarkable consistency.

Lewis Mumford described the already expansive national security state’s modus operandi this way: “one-way communication, the priestly monopoly of secret knowledge, the multiplication of secret agencies, the suppression of open discussion, and even the insulation of error against public criticism and exposure . . . which in practice nullifies public reaction and makes rational dissent the equivalent of patriotic disaffection, if not treason.” — location: [1244](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=1244) ^ref-3421

it would not be wrong to suggest that an eagerness to advance institutional interests and protect institutional reputations trumps all other considerations and routinely provides the basis for behavior that is dishonest, unprofessional, unethical, and frequently at odds with the nation’s well-being. — location: [1263](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=1263) ^ref-16311

Since 9/11, national security officials have been complicit in other disinformation campaigns of far greater relevance to policy. These include trumpeting the dangers of nonexistent Iraqi weapons of mass destruction; trivializing the anarchy in Baghdad following the overthrow of Saddam Hussein (“Stuff happens!”) and the scope of the insurgency (“pockets of dead-enders”); tagging a handful of low-ranking U.S. enlisted troops with responsibility for the systematic abuse of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib; and consistently underreporting the civilian casualties — location: [1276](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=1276) ^ref-32357

ever since Kennedy, presidents themselves and their chief lieutenants have viewed the apparatus as irredeemably broken.

When considering the national security state as it has evolved and grown over the past six decades, what exactly has been the value added?

the principal appeal of Iraq as a target was not that it was strong and fearsome; Gulf War I and a decade of sanctions had left Saddam Hussein with a decrepit army and essentially no air force. Iraq was inviting because it appeared so weak. — location: [1727](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=1727) ^ref-63482

Our fixation on all that has since gone wrong in Iraq itself should not lead us to overlook the fact that eliminating Saddam was never the endgame. The invasion of Iraq formed only one element of a breathtakingly extravagant design. The Wise Men to whom President Bush turned for advice after 9/11 expected an easy win against a weak opponent to set the stage for far greater victories. — location: [1732](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=1732) ^ref-63844

Iraq stands as the ultimate expression of what our habit of deference to Wise Men imbued with the ideology of national security has produced. The first application of the Bush Doctrine produced a shipwreck. — location: [1746](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=1746) ^ref-47276

When American power was ascendant, the United States could pretend to interpret history’s purpose or God’s will. Today, it can no longer afford to indulge in such conceits. — location: [1755](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=1755) ^ref-49435

Americans can no longer afford to underwrite a government that does not work. A condition of quasi-permanent crisis stretching across generations has distorted our Constitution with near-disastrous results. To imagine at this juncture that installing some fresh face in the White House, transferring the control of Congress from one party to the other, or embarking upon yet another effort to fix the national security apparatus will make much of a difference is to ignore decades of experience. — location: [1760](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=1760) ^ref-22129

The distinction between regime and nation was a crucial one. By employing these new military techniques, the United States could eliminate an obstreperous foreign leader and his cronies, while sparing the population over which that leader ruled. — location: [1828](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=1828) ^ref-46506

To judge by the record of the past twenty years, U.S. forces win decisively only when the enemy obligingly fights on American terms—and Saddam Hussein’s demise has drastically reduced the likelihood of finding such accommodating adversaries in the future. — location: [1869](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001ELVPMG&location=1869) ^ref-36692

war is also, and always, inherently political. Indeed, if war is to have any conceivable justification or utility, it must remain subordinated to politics.

the presumption of U.S. military supremacy that achieved such broad currency during the years following the Cold War is completely spurious.

The quadrennial ritual of electing (or reelecting) a president is not an exercise in promoting change, regardless of what candidates may claim and ordinary voters believe.

The newly inaugurated president takes office, buoyed by expectations that history will soon be restored to its proper trajectory and the nation put back on track.

the national security state—actually benefit from this dependency: It provides the source of status, power, and prerogatives.

Americans ought to give up the presumptuous notion that they are called upon to tutor Muslims in matters related to freedom and the proper relationship between politics and religion.

investing trillions in energy research might actually produce something useful.

They will tolerate stupefying incompetence and dysfunction in the nation’s capital, counting on the next president to fix everything that the last one screwed up.
