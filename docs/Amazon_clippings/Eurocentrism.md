## Highlights
The destructive dimension that its development always included now prevails by far over the constructive one that characterized the progressive role it fulfilled in history. — location: [56](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=56) ^ref-7695

The crisis of modernity is itself the sign of the obsolescence of the system. Bourgeois ideology, which originally had a universalist ambition, has renounced that ambition and substituted the postmodernist discourse of irreducible “cultural specificities” (in its crude form, the inevitable clash of cultures). As opposed to this discourse, I suggest that we begin with a view of modernity as a still incomplete process, which will only be able to go beyond the mortal crisis it is now undergoing through the reinvention of universal values. This implies the economic, social, and political reconstruction of all societies in the world. — location: [57](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=57) ^ref-6905

It adopted the Revolution’s slogan, but after having crushed the Paris Commune and emptied the term fraternity of its original content, replacing it with what can be expressed by the notion of belonging to the national community. — location: [164](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=164) ^ref-1531

Reason, which is destroying the alienated and excluded human being, nature, and entire societies (meaning human cultures), gives up being liberating and becomes a demolition company. — location: [186](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=186) ^ref-51998

For me, Marxism is the effective instrument which makes it possible both to analyze the challenges and define the strategies that are capable of changing the world in the directions specified here, provided also that we recognize that Marx only initiated the thinking and the action in this area. In other words, we define ourselves as starting from Marx and not as stopping with him. — location: [228](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=228) ^ref-54164

Description of Marxism as an instrument

---
The questions to be settled, in theory and practice, are complex. Their complexity does not allow any unilateral solution, which ignores the conflicts between the different constituent elements of the challenge. I will choose one example, because it seems to me to constitute the major dimension of the challenge on the global scale. The gigantic contrast between the center and the periphery which capitalism has constructed must be deconstructed. That will certainly require some development of the productive forces in the peripheries of the system, which, it must be recognized, runs the risk of relegating the other dimensions of emancipation to secondary importance. The contradiction lies in reality. Some people hope to surmount it by abolishing one of its terms. They persist in ignoring 80 percent of humanity, are satisfied with saying that they must first go through the capitalist stage, without taking into account that the polarization immanent to this system will never allow them to catch up. They ignore all the other dimensions of emancipation to the exclusive advantage of the prior development of the productive forces. Emancipating reason, in its living Marxist formulation, among others, must be able to combine the two contradictory terms of the challenge. — location: [230](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=230) ^ref-22488

Good description of challenge ahead, any why certain socialist societies of past acted the way they did

In any case, religions are part of the picture of reality and even constitute an important dimension of it. It is, therefore, important to analyze their social function, and in our modern world their articulation with what currently constitutes modernity: capitalism, democracy, and secularism. — location: [257](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=257) ^ref-21698

The Protestant sects in question lived on fundamentalist-type illusions. They created fertile ground for the endless reproduction of “sects” with apocalyptic visions that can be seen, today, flourishing in the United States. — location: [293](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=293) ^ref-22235

At the beginning of the Arab conquest beyond the peninsula, the dominant tendency among the Arabs was to reserve Islam for themselves and allow the conquered peoples to keep their own religions. — location: [388](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=388) ^ref-63781

---
two circumstances opened Islam to universalist ambitions: first, large segments of the conquered nations converted to Islam and second, the Arabs welcomed these conversions. — location: [390](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=390) ^ref-49505

---
Muslims gave an Islamic tinge to the practices and laws they discovered in the civilized area they conquered; on this level, Islamic law translates, sometimes literally, Byzantine law. They gave it a sacred Islamic clothing, but it is only clothing. — location: [464](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=464) ^ref-8146

The reason the Son of God was defeated on the Earth and crucified is obviously because it was never the intention of God (the Father) to establish His Kingdom on this Earth, where justice and happiness would reign forever. — location: [492](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=492) ^ref-26177

The call for a return to sources is a method that is almost always found in movements that identify themselves with religion. But in itself it means almost nothing, since the interpretation of the sources in question is always decisive. — location: [552](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=552) ^ref-38904

The management of some Italian cities as real commercial companies controlled by a syndicate of the richest shareholders (Venice is their prototype) represented a more clear-cut relationship with the first forms of capitalism than the relationship between Protestantism and capitalism was to be. — location: [556](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=556) ^ref-16087

American imperialism (and not the Empire) is destined to be even more savage than its predecessors. The latter did not claim to be engaged in a divine mission, at least to the same degree. — location: [575](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=575) ^ref-59841

---
the history of the United States is marked by particularities which contrast with those characterizing history on the European continent: the founding of New England by extremist Protestant sects, the genocide of the Indians, the enslavement of blacks, and the development of “communitarianism” in connection with successive waves of immigration in the nineteenth century. — location: [583](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=583) ^ref-20404

In their revolt against the British monarchy, the American colonists wanted to transform nothing in economic and social relations and sought only to no longer have to share their profits with the ruling class of the mother country. — location: [587](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=587) ^ref-63880

---
the power for themselves, not to do anything different from what they were doing during the colonial period, but to continue doing the same thing with greater determination and profit. Their objectives were above all the pursuit of westward expansion, which implied, among other things, the genocide of the Indians. The continuation of slavery was also not questioned. — location: [589](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=589) ^ref-34013

adhering to the ideology of individual success in the host country. This adherence was encouraged by the American system, which suited it perfectly. It delayed the development of class consciousness, which, scarcely had it started to develop, had to face a new wave of immigrants that prevented its political crystallization. — location: [595](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=595) ^ref-47576

---
Yet, here again the strengthening of this dimension of identity, which the American system uses and encourages, is done at the expense of class consciousness and the education of the citizen. — location: [599](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=599) ^ref-41119

the working class succeeded in developing a clear-cut class consciousness, which the successive waves of immigration had prevented in the United States. — location: [605](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=605) ^ref-17429

---
American democracy is the advanced model of what I call low intensity democracy. It operates on the basis of a total separation between the management of political life, based on the practice of electoral democracy, and that of economic life, ruled by the laws of capital accumulation. What is more, this separation is not subject to radical questioning, but is rather part of what is called the general consensus. But this separation destroys all the creative potential of political democracy. It castrates representative institutions, making them impotent when facing the market, whose dictates are accepted without question. — location: [613](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=613) ^ref-2711

Today, it is “terrorism,” an obvious pretext, which prepares the ground for acceptance of the true project of the ruling class: ensuring military control of the planet. — location: [626](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=626) ^ref-10395

modern culture is neither Christian nor Judeo-Christian: it is bourgeois. — location: [710](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=710) ^ref-4252

the fact that Islam is a religion and not a social project was the condition of its historical success. As a religion, it is capable of adapting to and superimposing itself on societies that are different from the one in which it was born. — location: [772](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=772) ^ref-52498

---
This is a mythical view of Antiquity. It is, in turn, the foundation for Eurocentrism: Europe claims to go back to its past, return to the sources (hence, the Renaissance), whereas in fact it is making a break with its own history. — location: [858](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=858) ^ref-34424

Reversing the terms of causality, I place the deformations of peripheral capitalism, which is the expression of the globalized expansion of capitalism, as the cause of the impasse in the ideological revolution. — location: [866](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=866) ^ref-8772

After the end of the Crusades, the Arab world, which had by then become Turko-Arab, entered into a process of military feudalization and turned in on itself. This was a regression that ended the brilliant civilization of the first centuries of the Caliphate. At the same time, Europe began to move out of feudalism, getting ready to make the leap into modernity and begin the conquest of the world. — location: [919](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=919) ^ref-3885

The discourse of the Islam proposed as an alternative to capitalist modernity, to which historical socialisms are likened without qualification, is entirely political in nature and not at all theological. — location: [948](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=948) ^ref-25798

Sharia is indifferent to democracy and has never called into question the autocratic forms of power. — location: [995](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=995) ^ref-49262

Although some of his followers describe this interpretation as returning to the sources (perhaps even to the Islam of the Prophet’s time), in reality it is only a return to concepts in force for two hundred years, coming from a society arrested in its development for several centuries. — location: [1018](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=1018) ^ref-29416

Having rejected democracy, the regimes substituted the homogeneity of the community, the growing danger of which is clearly visible in the declining democracies of the contemporary West. — location: [1027](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=1027) ^ref-33763

Comparing political Islam to fascism is not forced because it is a matter of making the disadvantaged classes accept their exploitation and oppression. — location: [1049](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=1049) ^ref-41376

---
The only democratic demand that should be defended is the right of the working classes and progressive forces to organize and act. They alone can erect a barrier against Islamic fascism. — location: [1059](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=1059) ^ref-45693

Pakistan was, with Saudi Arabia, behind the Islamic Conference (OIC), created in 1957 to quash the hope generated by the Bandung Conference of 1955 and break the unity of the Asian and African people by separating out Muslims. — location: [1082](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=1082) ^ref-23896

One could say that the “Meccan period” of Christianity extended over three centuries before the beginning of its “Medina period.” Christian Liberation Theology calls for undertaking the emancipatory mission of the first three centuries of Christianity and, as a result, breaks with the compromises of the Christian Empire. — location: [1162](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=1162) ^ref-28461

This pure economics is not interested in actually existing capitalism, which is a total system, economic, social, and political, but studies the laws of an imaginary capitalism that has nothing to do with reality. — location: [1185](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=1185) ^ref-4045

---
capitalist society is directly controlled by the economic, the instance that is not only determinant in the last analysis, but in capitalism is also dominant. Consequently, the laws that govern this economy appear to function as objective laws that are external to society, like laws of nature. — location: [1189](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=1189) ^ref-52094

---
the exploitation of labor by capital would be transparent (as are forms of exploitation prior to capitalism) and capitalism would not be capitalism, defined precisely by the opacification of this reality. — location: [1195](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=1195) ^ref-16919

However, if the world capitalist system is considered as a whole, then the polarization is more than obvious, it is unquestionable. — location: [1219](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=1219) ^ref-27826

---
it should be concluded that polarization is immanent to global capitalism and, consequently, the less developed countries are not on the path that will lead them to catch-up with the most advanced capitalist countries. — location: [1222](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=1222) ^ref-57402

The autonomy of the economic instance is specific to capitalism, whereas in the tributary systems it is subordinated to the political instance, as I pointed out above. — location: [1261](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=1261) ^ref-29494

Economic alienation, thus, constitutes the essential content of the ideology of capitalism. — location: [1332](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=1332) ^ref-21620

This greater flexibility of the less advanced societies seems to us to be central to the theory of unequal development. — location: [1386](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=1386) ^ref-48761

It is not until the modern age that the mystification of social relationships, peculiar to capitalism, can overthrow the domination of this sacred ideology and replace it with the rule of the economic. — location: [1513](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=1513) ^ref-46998

---
The acceptance and the reproduction of the system, therefore, require that the ideological order not be the object of any possible dispute; for this reason, the ideological order must also be made sacred. As a result, metaphysics becomes a major handicap to the maturation of scientific social reflection. — location: [1620](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=1620) ^ref-57981

the intellectual elite uses as its source of authority figurative interpretations that move away from the letter of the texts. — location: [1629](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=1629) ^ref-42456

---
It is a permanent tendency engendered by the metaphysical mind and its search for the absolute. This quest often entails abuses that become obstacles to the progress of knowledge, as when attempts are made to integrate more or less developed scientific fields into the metaphysical construct: astronomy, thus, becomes astrology, and mathematics the object of parascientific esotericism. — location: [1632](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=1632) ^ref-56170

Once again, there is nothing dramatically different here from that which takes place over the course of the following five Umayyad and Abbasid centuries. — location: [1729](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=1729) ^ref-31181

Movements like the Karmations of the ninth century C.E. undertake a critique of the law of Sharia in order to put forth an interpretation that justifies their aspirations for equality and justice. — location: [1838](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=1838) ^ref-33330

---
It is at one and the same time the expression of a project for the transformation of a reality deemed unbearable and a call for a return to past practices as the means for transformation. — location: [1848](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=1848) ^ref-26469

---
Like his predecessor, Hassan al-Basri (d. 728 C.E., 111 A.H.), Farabi believes that evil does not result from imperfections of the law (in this context, the Sharia), but from the shortcomings of those responsible for applying it. This is, indeed, an impoverished analysis. — location: [1854](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=1854) ^ref-10298

Arab-Islamic social thought remains imprisoned by the objective conditions of tributary society. It goes around in circles, sometimes colliding against the wall of rationalizing scholasticism, and sometimes running into the wall of formalist submission; sometimes it gets caught in the impasse of ascetic flight. — location: [1856](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=1856) ^ref-2199

---
the people of the period are as intelligent as their successors. They are, therefore, capable of experiencing malaise as a result of the impasse of tributary thought and of expressing, if necessary, a skepticism that prefigures a possible advance beyond it. But they do not go any farther. — location: [1860](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=1860) ^ref-46384

---
The great revolution that Islam accomplished in its first age of splendor was precisely to have adapted itself to the demands of this state construct. Without this revolution, the civilized East would probably never have been Islamized and the passing of the Arabs would have been marked only by destruction, as was the case with the passing of the Mongols. Those who are nostalgic about early Islam, the period of the Prophet and the first four Caliphs, refuse to understand that Islam’s success came only at this price. — location: [1871](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=1871) ^ref-12370

---
Arab-Islamic thought was established through a confrontation between the new ruling powers and the societies of the civilized East, the result of tributary reconstruction on a vast scale. — location: [1899](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=1899) ^ref-37482

---
Once the new tributary state was established and the process of Arabization and Islamization had advanced sufficiently, this confrontation could no longer contribute anything beneficial to the now-consolidated society. Arab-Islamic thought went peacefully to sleep. — location: [1900](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=1900) ^ref-61781

The progress of thought is associated with situations of confrontation and disequilibrium. Periods of stable equilibrium are periods of stagnation in thought. — location: [1902](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=1902) ^ref-54600

During this period, the Christian West is thus ready to comprehend the full significance of Islamic scholasticism, which it adopts, without the slightest uneasiness, virtually unchanged. — location: [1909](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=1909) ^ref-56080

But this poverty of Western scholasticism is precisely what gave Europe its advantage. Necessarily leaving a greater sense of dissatisfaction than Islam’s refined version, Western scholasticism could offer only slight resistance to the assaults of empiricism, in which Roger Bacon, restoring the importance of experience over the dialectics of scholastic syllogism, initiates a process of development independent of metaphysical discourse. — location: [1952](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=1952) ^ref-62747

It was easier to get rid of a body of “law” as primitive as the Frankish one, than it was to go beyond the erudite casuistry of Muslim law. — location: [1958](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=1958) ^ref-56637

the transition from the medieval period to the modern age really corresponds to the passage to the capitalist mode of production.

This double ebbing of Buddhism in India and China has been accompanied by a shift in the interpretation of Buddhism, which has come to have the status of a quasi-religion in the regions where it has survived, from Tibet to the Southeast Asia.

The new world is freed from the domination of metaphysics at the same time as the material foundations for capitalist society are laid.

the social formation that develops in Europe at this time is new, and that it is a capitalist system.

In a certain way, then, capitalism as a potential world system did not exist until there existed a consciousness of its conquering power. — location: [2112](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=2112) ^ref-52981

---
this conquest was not going to bring about a homogenization of the societies of the planet on the basis of the European model. On the contrary, this conquest progressively created a growing polarization at the heart of the system, crystallizing the capitalist world into fully developed centers and peripheries incapable of closing the ever widening gap, and making this contradiction within actually existing capitalism—a contradiction insurmountable within the framework of the capitalist system—the major and most explosive contradiction of our time. — location: [2130](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=2130) ^ref-20263

---
To admit the capitalist nature of the new system would be to admit that it has real, historical limits, which it will one day confront, and to underscore its internal contradictions. A dominant ideology must remove this type of destructive doubt from its field of vision. It must succeed in affirming itself as a system founded on eternal truths with a transhistorical vocation. — location: [2137](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=2137) ^ref-36727

the ideology deforms the vision of the historical genesis of capitalism, by refusing to consider this genesis from the perspective of a search for general laws of the evolution of human society; instead, it replaces this search with a twofold mythic construct.

In this way, it succeeds in concluding that the miracle of capitalism could only have been a European one. — location: [2142](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=2142) ^ref-49181

The third stage represents the higher level of productive forces characteristic of capitalism. This level implies capitalist property.

The feudal mode, as a species of the large family of tributary modes, is characterized by the same fundamental contradiction (peasant producers versus an exploiting tributary class) as all the other species of this mode.

Reality shows that conglomerations of peasant peoples are for a long time more provincial than national (the imposition of the language that will become national is a slow process) and the bourgeoisie of the feudal and Ancien Régime periods is often more cosmopolitan (at ease in all of Christian Europe, dividing its loyalties according to its financial interests, political allegiances, and religious convictions) than national in the modern sense of the term.

Discussion of the Austro-Marxist theses shows that this ideology inspired political attitudes in conflict with the requirements of capitalist development. Transferred from its place of origin (Western Europe) to the east and south, into the Austro-Hungarian, Russian, Ottoman, and Arab regions, nationalist ideology ended up causing the break up of some whole regions.

Capitalism in popular opinion, and we will see the same thing in scholarly analyses, is the North America and Western Europe of the television serial Dallas, the welfare state, and democracy.

These class alliances and oppositions, occurring at the global level (national alliances and conflicts, thus, being subordinate to the former), reproduce the distortions in the structure of development based on the unequal division of labor. They reproduce the material conditions that “make the internal factor unfavorable” at the periphery by ruining the hope of crystallizing progressive social forces like those that allowed workers at the center to undertake their economic class struggles in more favorable conditions, which made possible the parallel growth of incomes and productivity over a long period of time. At the same time, however, these conditions create a favorable terrain for the political illusions of bourgeois ideology, which has become, consequently, hegemonic over the workers of the centers. — location: [3720](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ARF254M&location=3720) ^ref-44959
