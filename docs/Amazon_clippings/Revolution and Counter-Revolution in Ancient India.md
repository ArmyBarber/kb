## Highlights
The reason why Brahmanism rose from the ashes and Buddhism did not, is to be accounted for, not by any inherent superiority of Brahmanism over Buddhism. It is to be found in the peculiar character of their priesthood. Buddhism died because its army of priests died and it was not possible to create. — location: [3129](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015DGN9OY&location=3129) ^ref-18282

"According to the Chachnama, the Buddhists of Sind suffered all sorts of indignities and humiliations under their Brahman rulers, and when the Arabs invaded their country, the Buddhists lent their whole hearted suport to them. — location: [3155](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015DGN9OY&location=3155) ^ref-41170

"It cannot be an accident that the Punjab, Kashmir, the district around Behar Sharif, North-East Bengal where Muslims now predominate, were all strong Buddhist Centres in the pre-Muslim days. — location: [3166](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015DGN9OY&location=3166) ^ref-43822

Adhyaya of the Vana Parva of the Mahabharat there is a verse 29 wherein the author says that "the whole world will be Islamic. All Yadnas, rites and ceremonies and religious celebrations will cease". — location: [3349](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015DGN9OY&location=3349) ^ref-28934

---
For too much emphasis is laid on the Muslim conquest of India. Reels and reels have been written to show how wave after wave of Muslim invasions came down like avalanche and enveloped the people and overthrew their rulers. The whole history of India is made to appear as though the only important thing in it is a catalogue of Muslim invasions. — location: [4466](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015DGN9OY&location=4466) ^ref-23211

If Hindu India was invaded by the Muslim invaders so was Buddhist India invaded by Bramhanic invaders. — location: [4470](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015DGN9OY&location=4470) ^ref-63412

---
Surely if Muslim invasions of Hindu India are worthy of study at the hands of the historians, the invasions of Buddhist India by Bramhanic invaders are equally deserving of study. — location: [4480](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015DGN9OY&location=4480) ^ref-17845

---
From the point of view of the permanent effect on the socia.l and spiritual life of the people, the Bramhanic invasions of Buddhist India have been so profound in their effect that compared to them, the effect of Muslim invasions on Hindu India have been really superficial and ephemeral. — location: [4483](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015DGN9OY&location=4483) ^ref-28826

---
These facts show that Brahmanic invasions of Buddhist India have a far greater significance to the Historian of India than the Muslim invasions of Hindu India can be said to have produced. — location: [4498](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015DGN9OY&location=4498) ^ref-5183

---
historically there have been three Indias, Brahmanic India, Buddhist India and Hindu India, each with its own culture. — location: [4519](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015DGN9OY&location=4519) ^ref-22341

---
the history of India before the Muslim invasions is the history of a mortal conflict between Bramhanism and Buddhism. — location: [4521](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015DGN9OY&location=4521) ^ref-50112

"The post of the Commander-in-Chief of the Kingdom, the very Headship of Government, the complete empire over every one are deserved by the Brahmin." Here we have one change in the law. This new law declares that the Brahmin has a right to become Senapati (Commander of forces), to conquer a kingdom, and to be the ruler and the Emperor of it. — location: [4557](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015DGN9OY&location=4557) ^ref-49311

It is by divesting the Guru of his authority to determine the Varna and vesting it in the father that Brahmanism ultimately converted Varna into Caste. — location: [4929](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015DGN9OY&location=4929) ^ref-50513
