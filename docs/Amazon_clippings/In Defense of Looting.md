Torture is celebrated a thousand times a day on television in police procedurals and action flicks, and most people accept imprisonment—years of unrelenting psychic torture—as a necessary fact of social life. — location: [63](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B084FXS161&location=63) ^ref-43370

local politicians, middle-class “leaders,” political groups, and reactionary organizations—block looting in order to gain power for themselves. These peacekeepers and de-escalators cooperate with the police to derail and destroy uprisings to show the white power structure that they are responsible parties, that, because they can control and contain the unruly masses, they are the “natural leaders,” the people who should be negotiated with. — location: [79](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B084FXS161&location=79) ^ref-42736

Looting rejects the legitimacy of ownership rights and property, the moral injunction to work for a living, and the “justice” of law and order. — location: [86](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B084FXS161&location=86) ^ref-37172

The racialized idea of an “Indian” identity did not yet exist outside the minds of the colonizers, but a natural racial tendency, one overcoming tribal, religious, and cultural differences, could be “revealed” by the offer of plunder. — location: [94](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B084FXS161&location=94) ^ref-47738

Looting is a word taken from a colonized people and used to denigrate and racialize riotous subalterns resisting English empire. It would from the very beginning refer to a nonwhite and lawless relationship to property. — location: [99](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B084FXS161&location=99) ^ref-19764

it is precisely the fact that looting exists at the nexus of race and class that gives it its tactical power. — location: [106](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B084FXS161&location=106) ^ref-43770

---
Looting represents a material way that riots and protests help the community: by providing a way for people to solve some of the immediate problems of poverty and by creating a space for people to freely reproduce their lives rather than doing so through wage labor. Looting is an act of communal cohesion. — location: [110](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B084FXS161&location=110) ^ref-4992

No matter how peaceful and “well-behaved” a protest is, the dominant media will always push the police talking points and the white supremacist agenda. Although it can sometimes be leveraged strategically, the mass media is the enemy of liberation, and when we shape our actions to conform to its opinions or perspectives, we will always lose. If we riot, they will slander us. If we behave politely, peacefully, legally, they will simply return to ignoring us. — location: [216](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B084FXS161&location=216) ^ref-52417

IF RIOTS ARE SEEN AS INCHOATE, SENSELESS OUTPOURINGS OF ANGER and resentment, it is also a commonplace that famous historical riots “give birth” to movements. — location: [262](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B084FXS161&location=262) ^ref-46140

looting makes day-to-day life easier by changing the price of goods to zero, relieves pressure by spreading wealth within the community, and reinforces bonds of solidarity and kinship through mutual struggle and action. — location: [275](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B084FXS161&location=275) ^ref-41688

the great wealth of the European empires was built on slave-produced commodities: the silver mined from Peru and Mexico, the sugar and tobacco raised in the Caribbean, the cotton grown in the American South. African people were enslaved to produce commodities on lands stolen through the genocide of the Indigenous people of the Americas. — location: [309](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B084FXS161&location=309) ^ref-4867

as the concepts of the commodity and private property were established, the primal, ideal commodity was the enslaved African—she existed exclusively for the further production of commodities and profits—and the purest property was stolen Indigenous land—it could be exploited, profited from, and expanded without concern for its historical and social role. — location: [312](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B084FXS161&location=312) ^ref-57885

during riots, police shoot looters on sight. The police exist to prevent Black people and poor people from threatening rich white people’s property rights: abolishing property is a direct attack on their power. — location: [326](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B084FXS161&location=326) ^ref-29532

A settler colony relies on the promise of “open land” or “virgin territory” as the material and ideological basis of its existence. The problem is that this “open land” is always already occupied. — location: [401](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B084FXS161&location=401) ^ref-16957

to capture the land, the settler colony must eliminate the Indigenous population through genocide, first by outright murder, later, by cultural destruction and assimilation.

Bacon’s Rebellion, the largest rebellion in the pre-Revolutionary colonies, taking place in 1676–1677, saw armed and aggrieved free Englishmen, joined by slaves and servants, loot and burn the capital of Virginia and briefly take over the colony. — location: [448](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B084FXS161&location=448) ^ref-37724

capitalism is a system ideologically committed to free labor—though the freedom in “free labor” is the freedom to starve.

it is precisely these urban communities of relatively independent Black people that would lead to the earliest development of police departments, as gangs of slave catchers evolved into formalized slave patrols designed to keep these “slave quarters” under surveillance and control. — location: [489](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B084FXS161&location=489) ^ref-52429

With no threat of losing their wage nor any real promise of advancement, and with no unemployed people liable to take a slave’s position—slavery is a system of 100 percent employment, after all—the enslaved tend to work the bare minimum required to avoid punishment and are less reliably coerced by speedups and expanded managerial demands. — location: [495](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B084FXS161&location=495) ^ref-1431

The earliest examples of employee surveillance, individual performance assessment, traceable units of production, detailed record keeping, and employee incentivization—all key concepts in modern management theory—occurred on slave plantations. — location: [499](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B084FXS161&location=499) ^ref-3896

a definition of capitalism that considers the wage the most important defining feature of capitalism, a definition that underestimates the importance, for example, of the totally necessary unwaged reproductive labor that predominantly falls to women under capitalism: housework, emotional care, and the literal reproduction of the working class. In these models, unwaged labor becomes not a central component of capitalism but a supporting side effect, an arbitrary management tactic. — location: [503](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B084FXS161&location=503) ^ref-23381

When Brazil abolished slavery in 1888—the last country in the Americas to do so—King Leopold II of Belgium’s genocidal domination of the Congo was but three years old.

slavery and settler colonialism were necessary components of the formation and maintenance of capitalism. And slavery and settler colonialism couldn’t be carried out, day by day, instinctively and across centuries, by millions of Euro-Americans, both rich and poor, without the formal, legal, psychological, and ideological frameworks of racism, white supremacy, and anti-Blackness. — location: [524](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B084FXS161&location=524) ^ref-37612

White rioters aim to keep people of color from developing autonomous economic, political, or social power as much as possible, or to crush it where it has appeared. To do this, they produce submission, fear, and economic ruin in the people they attack. White supremacist race riots thus tend to feature significantly more personal violence than they do attacks on property, more property destruction than looting, and, when looting occurs, these white rioters tend to target people’s homes and persons much more than these items are targeted during antipolice/anticapitalist uprisings, which tend to focus on stores and workplaces.III — location: [1650](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B084FXS161&location=1650) ^ref-12010

All accounts suggest that some significant number—a third to half of those killed, in the case of the lower total estimates—were white rioters.

movements foreground purity and noncriminality as the traits that signify people are worth defending from violence.
