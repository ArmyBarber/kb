Indeed, people whose retirement now depends increasingly on their holdings of stocks are more likely to feel that their fate is tightly bound up with corporate profits—even though the corporate lust for profits is typically responsible for their insecure financial situation. — location: [490](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016WL9AHE&location=490) ^ref-16095

Consumption replicates the problems from which it is supposed to provide a refuge. It is the devastation of creative social labor, not the retreat into shopping that deserves to be criticized. — location: [663](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B016WL9AHE&location=663) ^ref-38317
