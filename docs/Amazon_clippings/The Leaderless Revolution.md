Recapturing it is available through one simple mechanism: action. Action to reassert control over events in our lives.

Thus, even as consumers exercise their own choice to eat less fat, the government, pressured by cheese lobbyists (hilarious but true), exploits the consequence—unused high-fat milk and cheese—to persuade the consumer to eat more of it. — location: [968](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005X0JSKA&location=968) ^ref-4675

Instead of passing the necessary measures in the immediate aftermath of the crash, when they might have been politically possible, the congressional legislation empowers a new regulatory body to pass them in future, when without doubt still less political support will be available.
