## Highlights
The US-created state in the south would refuse to recognize the DPRK, just as Washington had refused to recognize the Korean People’s Republic, the republic Koreans had proclaimed for themselves on September 6, 1945, before US forces arrived in Korea. — location: [122](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07BTLBSGS&location=122) ^ref-2669

---
US general continues to exercise wartime operational control over the South Korean military, an uncomfortable reality that disproves the comforting myth (for South Koreans and US citizens) that the ROK is a sovereign country and not—what the North Korean media never grow tired of pointing out—a puppet of Washington. — location: [143](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07BTLBSGS&location=143) ^ref-30650

despite the protests of the country’s highest elected officials, nothing has changed. South Korea remains a base of operations for the Pentagon, its military under US operational control. — location: [172](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07BTLBSGS&location=172) ^ref-14242

---
In other words, forces guided by the Enlightenment values of equality and inclusion would become hegemonic. Economies would be reconstructed on the basis of publicly-owned enterprises, organized by a plan, and guided by the goal of satisfying human needs, rather than being based on privately-owned enterprises, organized by markets for the sole reason of channeling profits, rents, and interest to a numerically tiny class of capitalists. — location: [1934](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07BTLBSGS&location=1934) ^ref-52553

The key to re-animating Japan’s economy, and, therefore, to eclipsing the emergence of a communist Japan, US planners believed, was to strengthen Japan’s links to its former colonial possessions, including Taiwan and Korea. — location: [1987](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07BTLBSGS&location=1987) ^ref-24763

---
“Please have plan drafted of policy to organize a definite government of [South] Korea and connect up its economy with that of Japan.” — location: [2017](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07BTLBSGS&location=2017) ^ref-33473

---
The decision to organize a definite government of South Korea was taken to benefit Japan’s titans of industry, finance and commerce in service to the construction of a US empire, and in opposition to the worldwide movement for liberty, equality and human solidarity. — location: [2023](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07BTLBSGS&location=2023) ^ref-16054

---
it’s virtually impossible for South Koreans who embrace any kind of commitment to authentic Enlightenment values not to be accused of being a DPRK fellow traveler, and therefore of transgressing the National Security Law. — location: [2606](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07BTLBSGS&location=2606) ^ref-2502

Unified Progressive Party (UPP), a leftist party founded in 2011, which was dissolved in 2015 by the ROK’s Constitutional Court on the ground that its goal was “North Korea-style socialism.” — location: [2607](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07BTLBSGS&location=2607) ^ref-20915

The law has been used to jail university students for forming study groups to examine DPRK ideology. — location: [2629](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07BTLBSGS&location=2629) ^ref-6055

“When a computer user in South Korea clicks on an item on the” DPRK “Twitter account, a government warning against ‘illegal content’ pops up.” — location: [2645](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07BTLBSGS&location=2645) ^ref-42342

---
Koreans of the south remain committed to the emancipatory goals of the DPRK’s political program, and that absent the threat of punishment for overtly espousing these values, South Koreans would mobilize to demand change. — location: [2683](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07BTLBSGS&location=2683) ^ref-40246

---
so long as an ideology of liberation continues to be articulated by Pyongyang, the principal legal instrument of the South Korean police state must remain on the books to suppress the emancipatory movement of the south. — location: [2686](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07BTLBSGS&location=2686) ^ref-55063

the problem of the twenty-first century is the problem of US supremacy—the tacit but clear modern philosophy which assigns to the United States hegemony over the world and assumes that other countries will either be content to serve the interests of the United States’ dominant economic class or die out before its all-conquering march. — location: [4657](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07BTLBSGS&location=4657) ^ref-27985

---
the United States, the “last powerful imperialist predator” which has “spread its dark wings over” the whole world. — location: [4683](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07BTLBSGS&location=4683) ^ref-48540
