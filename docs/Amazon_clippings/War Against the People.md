## Highlights
The Occupation represents a resource for Israel in two senses: economically, it provides a testing ground for the development of weapons, security systems, models of population control and tactics without which Israel would be unable to compete in the international arms and security markets, but no less important, being a major military power serving other militaries and security services the world over lends Israel an international status among the global hegemons it would not have otherwise. Israel is a small country scrambling to carve out a niche in the transnational military-industrial complex. — location: [230](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077L4WPH2&location=230) ^ref-6918

Until the rise of the Likud to power in 1977, the surrounding Arab states were considered the source of existential threat to Israel, and the IDF prepared for conventional warfare abroad. Begin and Sharon, however, saw the conflict quite differently, i.e., not as an interstate Arab–Israeli conflict but an inter-communal one pitting Israel against the Palestinians. — location: [3318](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077L4WPH2&location=3318) ^ref-11258

When the war with Iraq broke out in the 1980s, Israel discreetly supplied more than $30 million in military equipment and parts to the Khomeini regime, in clear violation of the American arms embargo and despite the Carter Administration’s appeal not to do so until the hostages were freed. — location: [3814](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077L4WPH2&location=3814) ^ref-35950

Israel, in fact, continued to supply the Khomeini regime with military equipment and ammunition at least until 1987.14 — location: [3827](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077L4WPH2&location=3827) ^ref-9463

Israel had sold military and security equipment to four Arab countries (Algeria, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Morocco), in addition to Pakistan, between 2008 and 2012. — location: [3912](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077L4WPH2&location=3912) ^ref-34292
