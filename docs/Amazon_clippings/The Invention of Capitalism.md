the dispossession of the majority of small-scale producers and the construction of laissez-faire are closely connected, so much so that Marx, or at least his translators, labeled this expropriation of the masses as “primitive accumulation.” — location: [192](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EDIWR9M&location=192) ^ref-1086

---
the underlying development strategy of the classical political economists was consistent with a crude proto-Marxian model of primitive accumulation, which concluded that nonmarket forces might be required to speed up the process of capitalist assimilation in the countryside. — location: [205](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EDIWR9M&location=205) ^ref-53407

classical political economy advocated restricting the viability of traditional occupations in the countryside to coerce people to work for wages. — location: [212](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EDIWR9M&location=212) ^ref-43100

Even though the new institutionalist school concerns itself with the social division of labor, its theories are of no use in analyzing the coercive nature of primitive accumulation, since this school sees the economy arranging itself through voluntary contracts. — location: [229](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EDIWR9M&location=229) ^ref-39464

---
The classical political economists were unwilling to trust market forces to determine the social division of labor because they found the tenacity of traditional rural producers to be distasteful. Rather than contending that market forces should determine the fate of these small-scale producers, classical political economy called for state interventions of one sort or another to hobble these — location: [236](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EDIWR9M&location=236) ^ref-28072

If efficiency were of great importance to them, the classical political economists would not have ignored the law permitting the gentry to ride across small farmers’ fields in pursuit of foxes while forbidding the farmers from ridding their land of game that might eat the crops. — location: [241](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EDIWR9M&location=241) ^ref-56651

Just as a psychologist might detect a crucial revelation in a seemingly offhand remark of a patient, from time to time classical political economy discloses to us insights into its program that the classical political economists would not consciously welcome. — location: [265](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EDIWR9M&location=265) ^ref-11388

Poverty is that state and condition in society where the individual has no surplus labour in store, or, in other words, no property or means of subsistence but what is derived from the constant exercise of industry in the various occupations of life. Poverty is therefore a most necessary and indispensable ingredient in society, without which nations and communities could not exist in a state of civilization. It is the lot of man. It is the source of wealth, since without poverty, there could be no labour; there could be no riches, no refinement, no comfort, and no benefit to those who may be possessed of wealth. — location: [585](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EDIWR9M&location=585) ^ref-40202

all too often marxist works rely on a formal scheme in which precapitalistic formations are identified with the production of use values, in contrast to capitalism, in which production is simply treated as commodity production. — location: [1652](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EDIWR9M&location=1652) ^ref-46707

---
the attitude toward household production depends on the stage of capitalist development. At a time when self-provisioning was a serious barrier to the extension of the capitalist mode of production, classical political economy expressed an unremitting hostility toward conditions that would support the working-class household’s ability to provide for itself. Once political economy became confident that the household economy was sufficiently hobbled that its role as a producer would be subordinated to capitalist commodity production, economists seemed to lose all interest in the evolution of the social division of labor. Instead, they exhorted households to become more efficient producers of labor power. Finally, after problems of effective demand gained more prominence, economists treated the household as a locus of consumption. As a result, the role of the household as a site of production generally fell into oblivion. — location: [1658](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EDIWR9M&location=1658) ^ref-52453

division of time between the production of necessities in the household and the production of necessities while working for wages is the only variable in the system. Why would the capitalists be concerned about the division of the working day between household labor, or self-provisioning, and wage labor?

Now let us change the conditions so that households work two and a half hours on their own account. Households now need only half as much in wages to maintain their standard of living because of what they produce on their own account. Nonetheless, the amount of time devoted to luxuries does not decline, however. Consequently, for each hour spent working for wages, the household sector receives a payment equivalent to only one-third of an hour of labor. As a result, the rate of exploitation jumps to 300 percent. — location: [1772](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EDIWR9M&location=1772) ^ref-40291

Since capitalism had not developed technologies that were superior to the traditional methods of production, the creation of surplus value depended on capital’s success in creating absolute surplus value by lengthening the working day.

Thus, although in the long run, a far-reaching expansion of the productive powers of labor accompanied the new agricultural technology, the major attraction at the time appeared to be the reduction in the expense of maintaining labor over the extensive periods that rural workers had previously devoted to household production.

Smith’s discussion of the invisible hand reveals a great deal about his method of analysis. On some level, he recognized the conflict between his class-based explanation of the evolution of the social division of labor and his alternative explanation framed in terms of market forces.

by implying that (1) the contemporary social division of labor was the result of mutually advantageous adjustments and (2) that this process is a continuation of social behavior that stretches back into prehistoric times, Smith presented the misleading inference that the creation of the social division of labor was a natural process, devoid of conflict. — location: [4193](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EDIWR9M&location=4193) ^ref-6065

True, market forces could eventually lead to a more elaborate social division of labor. A decline in self-sufficiency could create a home market for mass-consumption goods; yet such a home market begins from a very small base and could not reach a substantial size overnight.

Consequently, in the agrarian question and the agrarian crisis the heart of the matter is not simply the removal of obstacles to the advance of agricultural technique, but what way these obstacles are to be removed, what class is to effect this removal and by what methods.—V.

The Russian economy suffered from the usual symptoms of a dualistic economic growth pattern. The Narodniks preferred to avoid the costs associated with capitalist development in Russia by building socialism on the basis of the traditional village economy. Lenin denounced their plans. The peasant’s life was a constant round of toil. Maxim Gorky (1922, 370), the novelist, conveyed the sense of the Russian village in the following words: “The technically primitive labour of the countryside is incredibly heavy, the peasantry call it strada from the Russian verb ‘stradat’—to suffer.” — location: [6814](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EDIWR9M&location=6814) ^ref-49780

like Smith, Lenin insisted that no external measures were needed to separate households from their means of production.

Lenin (1918, 377) also judged the American path to be “the most democratic … [and to cause] the masses less suffering.” Moreover, the American path was the most congenial to capitalist development (see also Lenin 1907, 238–42; 1908, 40–42). Lenin (1974, 91) contended that the American path “would inevitably withdraw the majority of these owners, whose position is hopeless in capitalist society from agriculture, and no ‘right to the land’ would be powerful enough to prevent this.” — location: [6879](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EDIWR9M&location=6879) ^ref-56381
