## Highlights
in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom — Free Trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation. — location: [94](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=94) ^ref-27566

---
The role of capitalist ideology is not to make an explicit case for something in the way that propaganda does, but to conceal the fact that the operations of capital do not depend on any sort of subjectively assumed belief. — location: [213](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=213) ^ref-23266

---
Over the past thirty years, capitalist realism has successfully installed a ‘business ontology’ in which it is simply obvious that everything in society, including healthcare and education, should be run as a business. — location: [271](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=271) ^ref-11291

---
emancipatory politics must always destroy the appearance of a ‘natural order’, must reveal what is presented as necessary and inevitable to be a mere contingency, just as it must make what was previously deemed to be impossible seem attainable. — location: [274](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=274) ^ref-50491

---
These ‘reforms’ invariably aim at making impossible what used to be practicable (for the largest number), and making profitable (for the dominant oligarchy) what did not used to be so’. — location: [279](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=279) ^ref-33355

---
the ideology that presents itself as empirical fact (or biological, economic...) necessity (and that we tend to perceive as non-ideological). It is precisely here that we should be most alert to the functioning of ideology. — location: [286](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=286) ^ref-29213

---
Capitalist realism insists on treating mental health as if it were a natural fact, like weather (but, then again, weather is no longer a natural fact so much as a political-economic effect). — location: [305](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=305) ^ref-715

---
it is necessary to reframe the growing problem of stress (and distress) in capitalist societies. Instead of treating it as incumbent on individuals to resolve their own psychological distress, instead, that is, of accepting the vast privatization of stress that has taken place over the last thirty years, — location: [311](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=311) ^ref-23205

---
how has it become acceptable that so many people, and especially so many young people, are ill? The ‘mental health plague’ in capitalist societies would suggest that, instead of being the only social system that works, capitalism is inherently dysfunctional, and that the cost of it appearing to work is very high. — location: [313](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=313) ^ref-17921

---
The persistence of bureaucracy in late capitalism does not in itself indicate that capitalism does not work – rather, what it suggests is that the way in which capitalism does actually work is very different from the picture presented by capitalist realism. — location: [320](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=320) ^ref-43658

---
is a matter not of apathy, nor of cynicism, but of reflexive impotence. They know things are bad, but more than that, they know they can’t do anything about it. But that ‘knowledge’, that reflexivity, is not a passive observation of an already existing state of affairs. It is a self-fulfilling prophecy. — location: [334](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=334) ^ref-59543

---
By privatizing these problems – treating them as if they were caused only by chemical imbalances in the individual’s neurology and/or by their family background – any question of social systemic causation is ruled out. — location: [341](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=341) ^ref-47159

the Control societies delineated by Kafka himself, but also by Foucault and Burroughs, operate using indefinite postponement: Education as a lifelong process... Training that persists for as long as your working life continues... Work you take home with you… Working from home, homing from work. — location: [356](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=356) ^ref-9485

We are in such a period. Today we see liberal capitalism and its political system, parliamentarianism, as the only natural and acceptable solutions’. — location: [452](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=452) ^ref-17348

neoliberalization is best conceived of as a ‘political project to re-establish the conditions for capital accumulation and to restore the power of economic elites’. — location: [453](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=453) ^ref-7893

in an era popularly described as ‘post-political’, class war has continued to be fought, but only by one side: the wealthy. — location: [454](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=454) ^ref-4098

neoliberals were more Leninist than the Leninists, using think-tanks as the intellectual vanguard to create the ideological climate in which capitalist realism could flourish. — location: [461](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=461) ^ref-41757

What must be discovered is a way out of the motivation/demotivation binary, so that disidentification from the control program registers as something other than dejected apathy. — location: [471](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=471) ^ref-17862

Sennett emphasizes the intolerable stresses that these conditions of permanent instability put on family life. — location: [502](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=502) ^ref-43847

---
expected: capitalism requires the family (as an essential means of reproducing and caring for labor power; as a salve for the psychic wounds inflicted by anarchic social-economic conditions), even as it undermines it (denying parents time with children, putting intolerable stress on couples as they become the exclusive source of affective consolation for each other). — location: [506](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=506) ^ref-26632

---
As production and distribution are restructured, so are nervous systems. To function effectively as a component of just-in-time production you must develop a capacity to respond to unforeseen events, you must learn to live in conditions of total instability, or ‘precarity’, as the ugly neologism has it. — location: [522](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=522) ^ref-58938

that post-Fordist workers are like the Old Testament Jews after they left the ‘house of slavery’: liberated from a bondage to which they have no wish to return but also abandoned, stranded in the desert, confused about the way forward. — location: [535](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=535) ^ref-21439

capitalism both feeds on and reproduces the moods of populations. — location: [542](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=542) ^ref-17539

Without delirium and confidence, capital could not function. — location: [542](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=542) ^ref-60332

significant rises in the rates of ‘mental distress’ over the last 25 years. — location: [545](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=545) ^ref-33456

---
rates of distress almost doubled between people born in 1946 (aged thirty-six in 1982) and 1970 (aged thirty in 2000). For example, 16 per cent of thirty-six-year-old women in 1982 reported having ‘trouble with nerves, feeling low, depressed or sad’, whereas 29 per cent of thirty year-olds reported this in 2000 (for men it was 8 per cent in 1982, 13 per cent in 2000). — location: [547](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=547) ^ref-56510

---
a person born in 1958 was more likely than one born in 1970 to achieve upward mobility through education, for example. — location: [557](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=557) ^ref-43980

---
The current ruling ontology denies any possibility of a social causation of mental illness. The chemico-biologization of mental illness is of course strictly commensurate with its de-politicization. — location: [569](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=569) ^ref-19281

---
Considering mental illness an individual chemico-biological problem has enormous benefits for capitalism. First, it reinforces Capital’s drive towards atomistic individualization (you are sick because of your brain chemistry). Second, it provides an enormously lucrative market in which multinational pharmaceutical companies can peddle their pharmaceuticals — location: [571](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=571) ^ref-6344

---
If it is true, for instance, that depression is constituted by low serotonin levels, what still needs to be explained is why particular individuals have low levels of serotonin. This requires a social and political explanation; and the task of repoliticizing mental illness is an urgent one if the left wants to challenge capitalist realism. — location: [574](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=574) ^ref-31723

‘creativity’ and ‘self-expression’ have become intrinsic to labor in Control societies; — location: [588](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=588) ^ref-60063

the attempt to crudely quantify these affective contributions also tells us a great deal about the new arrangements. — location: [589](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=589) ^ref-27088

hidden expectations behind official standards. Joanna, a waitress at the coffee chain, wears exactly seven pieces of flair, but it is made clear to her that, even though seven is officially enough, it is actually inadequate – the manager asks if she wants to look the sort of person ‘who only does the bare minimum.’ — location: [591](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=591) ^ref-41956

Enough is no longer enough. This syndrome will be familiar to many workers who may find that a ‘satisfactory’ grading in a performance evaluation is no longer satisfactory. — location: [596](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=596) ^ref-13168

‘aims and objectives’, ‘outcomes’, ‘mission statements’ – have proliferated, even as neoliberal rhetoric about the end of top-down, centralized control has gained pre-eminence. — location: [600](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=600) ^ref-8888

---
The way value is generated on the stock exchange depends of course less on what a company ‘really does’, and more on perceptions of, and beliefs about, its (future) performance. In capitalism, that is to say, all that is solid melts into PR, and late capitalism is defined at least as much by this ubiquitous tendency towards PR-production as it is by the imposition of market mechanisms. — location: [657](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=657) ^ref-9164

---
the distinction between what the big Other knows, i.e. what is officially accepted, and what is widely known and experienced by actual individuals, is very far from being ‘merely’ emptily formal; it is the discrepancy between the two that allows ‘ordinary’ social reality to function. — location: [669](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=669) ^ref-3963

there is no progressive tendency towards an ‘unsheathing’ of capitalism, no gradual unmasking of Capital as it ‘really’ is: rapacious, indifferent, inhuman. — location: [690](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=690) ^ref-43935

---
the essential role of the ‘incorporeal transformations’ effectuated by PR, branding and advertising in capitalism suggests that, in order to operate effectively, capitalism’s rapacity depends upon various forms of sheathing. — location: [692](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=692) ^ref-63909

Really Existing Capitalism is marked by the same division which characterized Really Existing Socialism, between, on the one hand, an official culture in which capitalist enterprises are presented as socially responsible and caring, and, on the other, a widespread awareness that companies are actually corrupt, ruthless, etc. In other words, capitalist postmodernity is not quite as incredulous as it would appear to be, — location: [693](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=693) ^ref-53401

those who do not allow themselves to be caught in the symbolic deception/fiction, who continue to believe their eyes, are the ones who err most. — location: [710](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=710) ^ref-10480

We the audience are not subjected to a power that comes from outside; rather, we are integrated into a control circuit that has our desires and preferences as its only mandate – but those desires and preferences are returned to us, no longer as ours, but as the desires of the big Other. — location: [726](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=726) ^ref-44578

The quest to reach the ultimate authority who will finally resolve K’s official status can never end, because the big Other cannot be encountered in itself: there are only officials, more or less hostile, engaged in acts of interpretation about what the big Other’s intentions. — location: [737](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=737) ^ref-27874

What happens in late capitalism, when there is no possibility of appealing, even in principle, to a final authority which can offer the definitive official version, is a massive intensification of that ambiguity. — location: [745](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=745) ^ref-14984

On the one hand, bureaucratic procedures float freely, independent of any external authority; but that very autonomy means that they assume a heavy implacability, a resistance to any amendment or questioning. — location: [750](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=750) ^ref-27129

Auditing can perhaps best be conceived of as fusion of PR and bureaucracy, because the bureaucratic data is usually intended to fulfill a promotional role: — location: [753](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=753) ^ref-9846

With ostensible acquittal, you petition the lower court judges until they grant you a non-binding reprieve. You are then free from the court, until the time when your case is re-opened.

incoherence at the level of what Brown calls ‘political rationality’ does nothing to prevent symbiosis at the level of political subjectivity, and, although they proceeded from very different guiding assumptions, Brown argues that neoliberalism and neoconservatism worked together to undermine the public sphere and democracy, producing a governed citizen who looks to find solutions in products, not political processes. — location: [902](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=902) ^ref-11429

perhaps, that, at the level of the political unconscious, it is impossible to accept that there are no overall controllers, that the closest thing we have to ruling powers now are nebulous, unaccountable interests exercising corporate irresponsibility. — location: [932](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=932) ^ref-11981

Although people are interpellated now as consumers – and, as Wendy Brown and others have pointed out, government itself is presented as a kind of commodity or service – they still cannot help but think of themselves as (if they were) citizens. — location: [936](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=936) ^ref-10661

the universality of bad experiences with call centers does nothing to unsettle the operating assumption that capitalism is inherently efficient, as if the problems with call centers weren’t the systemic consequences of a logic of Capital which means organizations are so fixated on making profits that they can’t actually sell you anything. — location: [943](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=943) ^ref-33605

the negative atheology proper to Capital: the centre is missing, but we cannot stop searching for it or positing it.

‘responsibi-lization’ to refer to this phenomenon – it is necessary to wager instead on structure at its most totalizing. Instead of saying that everyone – i.e. every one – is responsible for climate change, we all have to do our bit, it would be better to say that no-one is, and that’s the very problem. The cause of eco-catastrophe is an impersonal structure which, even though it is capable of producing all manner of effects, is precisely not a subject capable of exercising responsibility. — location: [979](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=979) ^ref-523

The delusion that many who enter into management with high hopes is precisely that they, the individual, can change things, that they will not repeat what their managers had done, that things will be different this time; but watch someone step up into management and it’s usually not very long before the grey petrification of power starts to subsume them. — location: [1019](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008H3WB36&location=1019) ^ref-40293

structure will often be invoked (either implicitly or openly) precisely at the point when there is the possibility of individuals who belong to the corporate structure being punished.

television now it’s a system of guidance – it tells you who is having the Bad Feelings and who is having the Good Feelings. And the person who is having the Bad Feelings is redeemed through a “hugs and kisses” moment at the end.

the affects that predominate in late capitalism are fear and cynicism.

to subordinate the state to the general will.

All that is real is the individual (and their families).

we need to reassert that, far from being isolated, contingent problems, these are all the effects of a single systemic cause: Capital.

Allowing the banking system to disintegrate was held to be unthinkable, and what ensued was a vast hemor-rhaging of public money into private hands.
