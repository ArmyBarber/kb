## Highlights
Smith’s idea of an invisible hand guiding the economy toward a desirable social outcome took hold because it fit the needs of those powerful persons who owned the land, raw materials, and capital upon which everyone else depends. — location: [63](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=63) ^ref-46388

---
Within this narrow market perspective, social relations become invisible. Workers are not just creatures that inhabit the workplace. They live within families, a class, and a society. If these relationships are ignored, the potential for substantial progress in grasping the economy is virtually nil. — location: [71](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=71) ^ref-60503

---
The ideology of economics intersected with the personal needs of the people who run the economy. — location: [79](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=79) ^ref-41958

---
Measures that could make workers more productive might threaten to undermine either the rationale for or the authority of the capitalists. So when they had to choose between justifying their position and improving workers’ productive potential, they opted for the former. — location: [80](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=80) ^ref-6178

---
a rational economy would offer workers a helping hand, not just in terms of providing a higher standard of living, but even more important, making sure that workers have every opportunity to develop their potential. — location: [88](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=88) ^ref-32851

---
These invisible handcuffs will continue to undermine society by stunting workers and thereby stifling the economy. — location: [95](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=95) ^ref-55477

---
When they do address them, they end up going to great lengths to nurture the market rather than people; — location: [100](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=100) ^ref-20967

---
Today, when the world faces such difficult threats, society cannot afford to waste a resource as valuable as human potential. — location: [102](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=102) ^ref-44636

the primacy of market transactions at the expense of the process of production. — location: [112](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=112) ^ref-434

---
Everybody irritated by a boss’s foolish command or a corporation’s ridiculous bureaucratic demands has taken a first step toward an awakening. These annoyances are symptomatic of a much larger problem associated with an outdated system of command and control at the workplace. Once that realization kicks in, you can sense your inner Bearded Slave. — location: [129](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=129) ^ref-35627

---
that what covers its inner potential is man-made. It is capitalist control that encrusts society with unsightly layers of waste and inefficiency. — location: [134](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=134) ^ref-53916

---
more often than not the waste and inefficiency serve a purpose—to maintain the existing system of control. — location: [135](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=135) ^ref-32139

---
policymakers pretend that all social objectives—whether higher wages, better working conditions, environmental protections, or even the quality of life—must give way to the promise of job creation. — location: [159](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=159) ^ref-57056

the impact of the narrow market perspective on everyday life. It examines the enormous amount of time that jobs consume, as well as the extension of controls on people’s behavior outside the workplace. — location: [166](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=166) ^ref-42656

---
Even after people became corralled into wage labor, Smith realized that controls had to reach deeper into people’s lives, even including state regulation of religion. In short, for all his positive rhetoric about freedom, Smith’s ultimate concern was to control people in order to make them obedient workers. — location: [180](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=180) ^ref-38071

“The Destructive Nature of Procrusteanism,” is the capstone of the book, surveying some of the innumerable ways in which capitalist discipline proves to be counterproductive, — location: [193](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=193) ^ref-50477

This blind devotion to the market is a kind of religion. — location: [209](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=209) ^ref-58724

---
The stubbornness of market fundamentalism reflects a theological view that markets are an end in themselves rather than merely a means to an end. — location: [217](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=217) ^ref-47350

---
“In the past the man has been first; in the future the system must be first.”5 Does this system really serve people’s essential needs? I do not think that it does. — location: [229](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=229) ^ref-42504

---
It forces on the individual, to the extent that he is caught up in the relationships of the “market,” the norms of its economic activity. — location: [245](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=245) ^ref-5467

people must learn to adjust to the market rather than make any attempt to have the market adjust to people’s needs. — location: [248](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=248) ^ref-49954

---
Economists in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries clearly understood that people would naturally resist employment as wage laborers if they could maintain themselves outside of the market. They proposed strong measures to deny people alternative means of support, including the confiscation of the land upon which people had traditionally provided for their own needs. — location: [262](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=262) ^ref-10332

---
once wage labor became sufficiently common, people would begin to think of it as normal and take it for granted. — location: [266](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=266) ^ref-12252

---
The brutal measures that were required to transform society to the point that people took wage labor for granted did obvious damage. However, once people accept market life as the norm, the Procrustean bed begins to fall from view. — location: [274](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=274) ^ref-60495

---
so long as the causes of the alienation, insecurity, and powerlessness that go along with capitalism remain invisible, free-floating anger becomes common. — location: [278](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=278) ^ref-46690

---
Procrusteans stand ready to impose their will, unleashing violent repression when necessary. For example, in Uruguay, when such repression was in full force, the journalist Eduardo Galeano observed, “People were in prison so that prices could be free.” — location: [289](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=289) ^ref-6749

---
How can anyone rationalize why hours of work have not radically decreased despite the proliferation of modern, labor-saving technology? — location: [298](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=298) ^ref-50684

---
Are these conditions the natural functioning of the labor market or the intentional manipulation of Procrusteans? — location: [299](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=299) ^ref-10545

---
They might seem impossibly utopian, but only because the gate-keepers of the Procrustean economy stubbornly refuse to accept any dialogue or even the possibility of a dialogue. As Margaret Thatcher adamantly proclaimed, “There is no alternative.” The iron bed must remain in place. Everyone must learn to accept the dictates of the Procrustean economy—to voluntarily don the invisible handcuffs. — location: [301](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=301) ^ref-62140

---
That business is not particularly good at creating jobs—especially good jobs—should come as no surprise. Wall Street rewards corporations for eliminating jobs, not creating them. Profits rather than jobs are the highest priority for business leaders. — location: [319](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=319) ^ref-18361

---
Despite the poor record of large corporations in providing good jobs, business attacks any legislation intended to raise wages or improve working conditions as a “job killer.” — location: [334](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=334) ^ref-16880

“fields of work” are giving rise to a society that is increasingly “jobless but not workless.” — location: [350](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=350) ^ref-63888

---
modern technology has not so much been used to relieve people of the burdens of work as to extract more work from people. — location: [363](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=363) ^ref-37528

---
Shouldn’t a successful economy emphasize the development of technology that makes work easier, rather than creating technology intended to make a smaller number of people work more intensively? Why wouldn’t a successful economy apply modern technology to make work less stressful? — location: [369](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=369) ^ref-33161

---
Because most people do not enjoy taking orders and have a natural tendency to assert some independence, workers can become rebellious when workplace authorities do not treat them with respect, especially when they feel confident that comparable jobs are readily available. — location: [380](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=380) ^ref-42185

---
Management responded harshly, forcing workers to halt, claiming that they had violated the legitimate channels of authority, training, and communication. If workers had been given the opportunity to organize their own work, Watson claims that they could have completed the task in one-tenth the scheduled time. Management, however, was determined to stop workers from organizing their own work, even when it would have been finished more quickly and management would have saved money because of the speed-up. — location: [399](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=399) ^ref-51423

---
To admit that workers have something to contribute beyond blindly carrying out the demands of management undermines the ultimate rationale for management’s domination. — location: [405](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=405) ^ref-50763

---
industry had two options available. It could intensify its supervision over workers or it could actively engage its employees by giving them more control over their jobs. — location: [417](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=417) ^ref-2630

---
Once you get beyond the theology of capitalism, the ultimate justification for this mode of production is that the efficiency of markets can offer the best possible life for people. Part of the illusion of efficiency is that capitalism is a meritocracy—that the best people rise to positions of authority. Consequently, maintaining the legitimacy of authority is crucial for capitalism. — location: [425](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=425) ^ref-2796

Ideally, the Federal Reserve would like to maintain a Goldilocks economy, in which economic growth is just right—strong enough to increase profits, but slow enough to keep workers in check. — location: [464](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=464) ^ref-13046

The depreciation of the circulating medium (meaning inflation) has been more injurious to monied men … It may be laid down as a principle of universal application, that every man injured or benefited by the variation of the value of the circulating medium in proportion as his property consists of money. — location: [491](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=491) ^ref-9489

the Federal Reserve’s partisan behavior is designed to tilt the economy in the direction of the wealthy by making workers more compliant. — location: [503](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=503) ^ref-64242

---
“a baseless fear of full employment” rather than the prevention of inflation was the guiding principle of the Federal Reserve. — location: [507](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=507) ^ref-53331

---
The periodic slowdowns that the Federal Reserve engineered to undermine wage growth are unlikely to stimulate economic growth. According to a study by the Bank for International Settlements, slowdowns actually seem to diminish rather than promote long-term growth. — location: [514](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=514) ^ref-32514

The effort to tame inflation was, in reality, mostly a class war, what might be called “sado-monetarism.” — location: [540](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=540) ^ref-65406

The Federal Reserve serves the needs of the powerful. Its role is to protect capital against the interests of labor. In order to maintain labor discipline, the Federal Reserve Board is entrusted with the task of maintaining a level of unemployment high enough to keep workers fearful of losing their jobs. — location: [556](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=556) ^ref-26621

Sado-monetarism is not so much a matter of monetary discipline, as most economists would have it, but of class discipline. — location: [570](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=570) ^ref-61209

In stark contrast to the sadistic attitude toward labor, when speculative excesses or some other miscalculation create adverse economic conditions that threaten to harm powerful business interests, especially in finance, the Fed is almost certain to rush in to the rescue, throwing money at business interests while letting labor hang out to dry. — location: [651](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=651) ^ref-14096

economics, which one might expect to be the study of the material well-being of society, turns out to emphasize a subset of psychological processes—consumers’ supposed introspection, with matters such as corporate estimates of goodwill thrown in. — location: [1228](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=1228) ^ref-52002

workers’ productivity would increase if business trained as many workers as possible.

Emphasizing consumption rather than production is useful in this regard. Consumers typically purchase finished goods. Producers, in contrast, may have to sink substantial funds in capital goods that may be unable to contribute to production for a considerable period. In the meantime, market conditions may have changed, making such investments inappropriate.

Labor-saving technology can do away with certain types of work altogether, or it can force workers to work harder or faster.

After modern technology required more expensive capital goods, ownership passed into the hands of people whose major qualification was access to finance.

People who profit by charging exorbitant rates for bottled water or electricity generators during emergencies appear to be immoral creatures rather than intelligent entrepreneurs meeting a social need. — location: [3992](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=3992) ^ref-49392

The problem is that the Procrustean world has created a special language, one that intentionally clouds the harsh reality in which people find themselves, in effect, making the handcuffs invisible and questions of class unthinkable. — location: [4003](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=4003) ^ref-51577

In such cases, the rhetoric of liberty and democracy quickly gives way to violent repression, typically justified in the name of protecting freedom. If people could break through the veil of indoctrination, they would clearly recognize that the current system is neither efficient nor productive of human welfare. — location: [4018](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=4018) ^ref-61766

The Procrustean language, however, in painting employers in this charitable light, also betrays the underlying imbalance of power. Employers are said to “give” jobs to workers who are reduced to “taking” jobs. This language suggests that the transaction between employer and employee represents an act of benevolence on the part of the job giver rather than a bargain among equals. — location: [4031](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=4031) ^ref-54531

This inequality between job givers and job takers presumably explains why society is expected to shower the generous job givers with so many benefits, such as subsidies and tax write offs. In contrast, social programs, directed at the people who actually do the work, seem to be nothing more than impositions by ungrateful wretches, who are trying to extort excessive benefits from the already overburdened taxpayer—a code word for the wealthy, — location: [4035](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=4035) ^ref-10093

fear sometimes makes people more likely to crave authority. Whether or not this craving is operational, people come to feel unworthy and doubt their own capacities. — location: [4058](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=4058) ^ref-34397

the great challenge is to win the support of the majority of the population—those people who would stand to benefit the most from a progressive reorganization of society, but who still unquestioningly submit to Procrusteanism. — location: [4070](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=4070) ^ref-39538

modern institutions identify merit by looking for characteristics associated with upper-class life. Once people become conditioned to accept this pecking order, the system takes on the appearance of a meritocracy. — location: [4076](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=4076) ^ref-18468

society today has an almost hereditary system in which children of the affluent have easy access to the elite universities, which then presumably certify merit. — location: [4097](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=4097) ^ref-36620

rewards are certainly not commensurate with contributions to society. How could anyone rationally explain why schoolteachers or nurses earn less than advertising executives or stockbrokers? — location: [4115](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=4115) ^ref-3071

The love of money as a possession—as distinguished from the love of money as a means to the enjoyments and realities of life—will be recognised for what it is, a somewhat disgusting morbidity, one of those semi-criminal, semi-pathological propensities which one hands over with a shudder to the specialists in mental disease. — location: [4255](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=4255) ^ref-20674

Unless the people in power are willing to abandon the present system of class and control that hobbles society, ultimately even those whom the present system seems to benefit may well suffer the same fate as the admiral on the ill-fated ship who failed to heed a call from an ordinary member of the crew. — location: [4274](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=4274) ^ref-42388

Just as centuries ago capitalism set free bourgeois energies that had been repressed under feudalism, a new form could be equally liberating for the masses of people presently trapped in their Procrustean beds. — location: [4365](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=4365) ^ref-30852

This approach to measuring human capital also reinforces the practice of ignoring work, workers, and working conditions, since learning on the job never enters into the picture. — location: [4514](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005C9GNNM&location=4514) ^ref-64541

To do so would mean understanding workers as human beings with hopes and desires who have capacities that go far beyond simply taking orders.

Anyone who suffers under the illusion that markets adequately supply the means to improve the quality of life needs only turn on a television set. Here is a technology with the capacity to uplift and enlighten people.
