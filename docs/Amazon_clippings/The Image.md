## Highlights
To dispel the ghosts which populate the world of our making will not give us the power to conquer the real enemies of the real world or to remake the real world. But it may help us discover that we cannot make the world in our image. It will liberate us and sharpen our vision. It will clear away the fog so we can face the world we share with all mankind. — location: [155](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0082XLP7O&location=155) ^ref-7856
