The success of the US in maintaining the secrecy around the atom bomb and the Stealth fighter, or in any classified operation, lies in compartmentalization. — location: [412](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005V63YGK&location=412) ^ref-12506

Bill Casey and the CIA’s general counsel Stanley Sporkin put extreme pressure on both the network and anchor Peter Jennings to stop their coverage. During the semi-public battle, ABC’s stock dropped from $67 to $59 a share, and by December, the firm Capital Cities was trying to buy the network. Capital Cities successfully completed the buyout of ABC in March of 1985, after which the CIA conveniently dropped a suit against the network.7 Bill Casey had helped to found Capital Cities and had served both as its lawyer and as a member of its board of directors in the years between his service as SEC chairman for Nixon and as director of Central Intelligence for Reagan. ABC became known thereafter as “the CIA network.” — location: [1517](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005V63YGK&location=1517) ^ref-35472

When Enron went bankrupt, the US government allowed Enron to sell Enron Online to the Union Bank of Switzerland.36 That meant that all of the evidence of money laundering by Enron is now owned by a Swiss bank and out of reach for federal prosecutors. — location: [1681](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005V63YGK&location=1681) ^ref-6332

The competitive edge provided by handling drug money is an instrumental factor in who can compete in a globalized, new-world, corporate order. — location: [1702](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005V63YGK&location=1702) ^ref-32931

The use of the drug trade to secure economic advantage for an imperialist nation is at least as old as the British East India Company’s first smuggling of opium from India into China in the late 1600s (the defense of that British practice, Scott points out, was John Stuart Mill’s motivation for writing the tract “On Liberty”). They did that for 300 years. When something works that well, the ruling elites rarely let go of it. — location: [1804](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005V63YGK&location=1804) ^ref-20152

the CIA created powerful local warlords who were very well armed and who effectively prevented any national government from restoring stability. In both cases, the warlords derived their power from their direct involvement in the drug trade. — location: [2138](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005V63YGK&location=2138) ^ref-15248

A task force headed by Vice President Al Gore, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbot19 and involving exclusive US Treasury contracts with Goldman Sachs, the Harvard Institute for International Development, the IMF, and the World Bank worked in partnership with the government of Boris Yeltsin to remake the Russian economy. What happened was that Russia, in the words of Yeltsin himself, became a “mafiocracy” and was looted of more than $500 billion in assets; its economy was ruined, its currency destroyed, its population rendered desperate, and its ability to support a world-class military establishment smashed. — location: [2228](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005V63YGK&location=2228) ^ref-14655

The devastation of Russia’s economy was worse than what America experienced in the Great Depression. By 1932, the US gross national product had been cut by almost one-third. But within just six months of the 1998 crash, Russia’s economy, measured in dollars, had fallen by more than two-thirds. — location: [2317](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005V63YGK&location=2317) ^ref-9690

“The Soviet Union was economically self-sufficient except for bananas, coffee, and coconuts.”34 By the dawning of the new century, except for small parts of Moscow, Saint Petersburg, and other cities where the oligarchs spent their money, it was as badly ruined as it had been at the worst part of World War II. — location: [2340](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005V63YGK&location=2340) ^ref-13974

If you hear somebody say, and I have, the CIA abandoned Afghanistan after the Soviets left and that we never paid any attention to that place until September 11th, I would implore you to ask those people how we were able to accomplish all we did since the Soviets departed. How we knew who [sic] to approach on the ground, which operations, which warlord to support, what information to collect. Quite simply, we were there well before the 11th of September — location: [2662](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005V63YGK&location=2662) ^ref-56386

Al Qaeda is infiltrated by the CIA. In other words, there were no “intelligence failures”! In the nature of a well-led intelligence operation, the “intelligence asset” operates (wittingly or unwittingly) with some degree of autonomy, in relation to its US government sponsors, but ultimately it acts consistently, in the interests of Uncle Sam. — location: [2855](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005V63YGK&location=2855) ^ref-47375

al Qaeda is supported by Pakistan’s military intelligence, the Inter-services Intelligence (ISI). Amply documented, the ISI owes its existence to the CIA: “With CIA backing and the funnelling of massive amounts of US military aid, the ISI developed [since the early 1980s] into a parallel structure wielding enormous power over all aspects of government .… The ISI had a staff composed of military and intelligence officers, bureaucrats, undercover agents, and informers estimated at 150,000.” — location: [2871](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005V63YGK&location=2871) ^ref-2491

The same cold, administrative approach to life that built the vast economies of the modern world is also preparing a terrible solution to the collapse of those economies. In the Empire’s vision, love and art and religion and community are invisible; they count for nothing. It is as if the human race existed only in a statistical dimension; a calculus equation in need of a solution. — location: [12838](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005V63YGK&location=12838) ^ref-59611
