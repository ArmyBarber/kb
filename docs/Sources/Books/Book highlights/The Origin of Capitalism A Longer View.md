## Highlights
At the heart of this argument was Marx’s insistence on the historical specificity of capitalism. This meant that capitalism had a historical beginning, in very specific historical conditions, and therefore it had a conceivable end. Capitalism was not the product of some inevitable natural process, nor was it the end of history. — location: [548](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BRFN69S&location=548) ^ref-65415

The concept of ‘bourgeois revolution’ is confusing for several reasons. Was a revolution necessary to bring about capitalism, or simply to facilitate the development of an already existing capitalism? Was it a cause or an effect of capitalism? — location: [1756](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01BRFN69S&location=1756) ^ref-22780
