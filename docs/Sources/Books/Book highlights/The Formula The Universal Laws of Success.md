Innovation itself has no age limit as long as we continually buy our metaphorical tickets and get our work out into the world.

Your ability to turn an idea into a discovery is equally important, and that varies dramatically from person to person. We called this ability a person’s Q-factor, — location: [2664](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07B863X6B&location=2664) ^ref-2061

Performance alone wasn’t enough. If I wanted my work to have any impact, I couldn’t avoid the people who needed to recognize my research. — location: [2830](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07B863X6B&location=2830) ^ref-64354
