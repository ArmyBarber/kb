We have the best-trained doctors on the planet, and yet their avoidable mistakes kill nearly 200,000 Americans each year. — location: [61](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C2IM&location=61) ^ref-6411

as consumers, we demand the latest technologies from our banks, telecom providers, and retailers, but we passively accept last century’s technology in our hospitals and medical offices. — location: [62](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C2IM&location=62) ^ref-48592

Scientists have demonstrated that under the right conditions, our brains undergo a shift, causing us to perceive the world around us in ways that contradict objective reality. — location: [67](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C2IM&location=67) ^ref-40380

---
our health care system functions in an environment unlike any other. There’s nothing comparable to it in American culture, society, or industry. The rules are different, the stakes are elevated, and the perceptions of everyone in it—from doctors to patients to US presidents—get radically distorted, leading to behaviors that prove hazardous to our health. — location: [70](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C2IM&location=70) ^ref-49124

---
If character flaws were the central challenge facing American medicine, the solutions would be much simpler. We would select different medical students and isolate the sociopaths. But health care’s most common failings aren’t individual. They’re contextual, systemic, and therefore much more problematic. — location: [82](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C2IM&location=82) ^ref-51092

Two features, however, were out of proportion, both with clear intent. First, David’s head is notably oversized, signifying the importance of discernment and choice as he sets out to face the biblical giant Goliath. Second, his hands are huge, a nod to the importance of action. — location: [103](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C2IM&location=103) ^ref-998

As individuals and as a nation, we need to see what is happening, decide to do something about it, and take action. — location: [105](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C2IM&location=105) ^ref-45293

It’s amazing how quickly time moves when you’re the doctor providing care. And it’s eerie how slowly time passes when your father is the patient, and all you can do is watch and wait. — location: [152](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C2IM&location=152) ^ref-24280

I was jolted by the realization that these well-trained physicians from renowned academic programs seemed content to rely on the memory of a man in his seventies to tell them what kinds of medications he was taking and the exact dosages. — location: [216](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C2IM&location=216) ^ref-37518

A patient with his spleen removed, for example, is at risk of developing severe infection. — location: [231](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C2IM&location=231) ^ref-11550

One specific bacterium that’s particularly problematic for people without a spleen is the pneumococcus. Without a spleen to filter this pathogen out of the bloodstream, the pneumococcus can infect a patient’s entire body. — location: [232](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C2IM&location=232) ^ref-57182

every person whose spleen has been removed should receive a pneumococcal vaccine. — location: [235](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C2IM&location=235) ^ref-31624

My dad’s doctors in New York assumed the ones in Florida had given him the vaccination. The physicians in Florida assumed the ones in New York had done so. The medical specialists believed the surgeon who removed my father’s spleen had administered it. And all the specialty physicians thought my father’s internal medicine doctor had taken care of it. In the end, no one had. — location: [237](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C2IM&location=237) ^ref-23633

On most visits, my father’s physician needed only to assess the wound and make sure it was healing properly. For that, my sister could have visited our dad at night, taken a digital photo of his foot, and e-mailed it to the doctor for thorough review at her convenience. I doubt this idea ever crossed the doctor’s mind. Physicians are not trained in medical school to worry about the inconveniences they place on patients or their families. And in their practices, they find that insurance companies are rarely willing to pay for the kind of “virtual visits” that would have saved my sister more than a hundred hours of missed work. — location: [265](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C2IM&location=265) ^ref-24022

One morning, a driver rear-ended his car. My father suffered severe and disabling back pain. To provide relief, his doctors recommended a series of cortisone injections around his spinal cord. To prevent bleeding from the injections, they took him off the anticoagulation medications he was on for his atrial fibrillation. Before he could complete the series, he suffered a massive blood clot in his brain. — location: [274](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C2IM&location=274) ^ref-13831

when there were no more suggestions to be made, no procedures left to recommend, the doctors stopped coming altogether. From that moment on, we never saw another physician in our father’s room. No one came by to check in on the family or ask how we were doing. None of his doctors dropped in to offer a word of support. I felt abandoned by these healers in our time of greatest need. — location: [284](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C2IM&location=284) ^ref-17544

---
Throughout much of history, there was little doctors could do to help their patients. They simply lacked the tools, medications, and knowhow we have today. Perhaps that’s why doctors of the past became such skilled practitioners of empathy and compassion. — location: [287](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C2IM&location=287) ^ref-29876

---
Doctors get paid for intervening, not for moments of compassion. Today, the insurance reimbursement system dictates how care is delivered. It has eroded personal relationships, devalued empathy and kindness, and undermined the very mission and commitment that led most doctors to practice medicine in the first place. — location: [292](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C2IM&location=292) ^ref-21627

US health care trails almost every other industry in the adoption of information technology. — location: [305](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C2IM&location=305) ^ref-41477

---
fewer than 15 percent of all patients can use e-mail with their doctors, and even fewer can review their own medical information online or schedule a “video visit.” — location: [306](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C2IM&location=306) ^ref-49422

---
once all Americans begin to see the true problems endemic in our health care, and once we understand the threat they pose to our families and ourselves, we will demand change. And once enough people do, we can reverse the damage, for good. — location: [320](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C2IM&location=320) ^ref-17479

---
physicians perceive anxiety as deriving from the individual, not from the individual’s situation. They fail to recognize the fear and anxiety that patients experience every time they go to see a physician. — location: [1043](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C2IM&location=1043) ^ref-16980

Rarely do the consequences of having to miss school or work enter the doctor’s consciousness or affect clinical decision making. — location: [1047](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C2IM&location=1047) ^ref-41408

But Dr. Greene knew that part of being a physician meant improving people’s lives, not just treating their physical problems. — location: [1077](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C2IM&location=1077) ^ref-21287

---
The reality is that today’s health care delivery system is not designed around your time or priorities. It is designed to maximize the productivity of doctors. And as the physician’s reimbursement rates continue to decline, and as insurance companies continue to refuse to pay for virtual care, none of this is likely to change soon. — location: [1110](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C2IM&location=1110) ^ref-37149

---
No, the coat lengths were designed to establish relative authority among doctors. In the same way that stripes and stars on military uniforms communicate rank, the length of a doctor’s coat establishes to what degree his or her opinion matters. In medicine, long-standing traditions continue far beyond their logical utility, evidence that health care is influenced as much by culture and past norms as by science. — location: [1125](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C2IM&location=1125) ^ref-29707

---
Even today, we rely on the practices and rituals of yesteryear. — location: [1188](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C2IM&location=1188) ^ref-53581

---
As patients, we expect our doctors to have access to high-powered machinery that can heal us in times of crisis. But at a subconscious level, we also expect the hands-on rituals of the past. We want our medical care to be both “high tech” and “high touch.” Both have become health care’s table stakes. — location: [1199](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C2IM&location=1199) ^ref-29663

---
Perception is rarely objective and data based. It reflects the context of our environment and is altered by anxiety, fear, and reward. And when our perception changes, we unknowingly act in ways that seem irrational to outside observers. — location: [1208](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C2IM&location=1208) ^ref-31162

---
When smart people with access to clear data make foolish decisions, all signs point to a subconscious shift in perception. In this case, we can best ascribe the selection to “anchoring bias.” — location: [1262](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C2IM&location=1262) ^ref-56152

But when something seems logical, our brains tend to believe that it’s true, even when the scientific data say otherwise. — location: [1276](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C2IM&location=1276) ^ref-59733

American health care is the auto dealership of the past, void of the transparency, technology, and consumer control we value today. And most of us just accept it. — location: [1307](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C2IM&location=1307) ^ref-63023

we tend to worry more about events we hear and read about in the media and our social networks than those that are actually the most dangerous. — location: [1318](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C2IM&location=1318) ^ref-7571

we likewise focus on data breaches, which are important and worrisome. And yet we pay little attention to medical errors that result from a lack of data. — location: [1322](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C2IM&location=1322) ^ref-37661

Quality outcomes today rarely reflect individual physician ability, but rather the performance of the entire team providing medical care. — location: [1413](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C2IM&location=1413) ^ref-15325

---
Success is determined much more by whether doctors are reimbursed for the quality of their outcomes or the quantity of the procedures they perform. This context shapes not just doctors’ perceptions but also their clinical performance. — location: [1420](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C2IM&location=1420) ^ref-43299

by picking the best system (based on these reports), patients will be much better off than when they try to identify “the best” individual doctor for their problems. — location: [1444](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C2IM&location=1444) ^ref-2580

The medical care we receive and our perception of its quality are greatly affected by others. In fact, the influence of some of health care’s biggest players, from insurance companies to drug manufacturers, contributes greatly to the problem and has serious negative consequences for us as well. — location: [1496](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C2IM&location=1496) ^ref-4362

traditional approaches they believe have worked for decades.

That’s simply the mindset necessary to run for and stay in office. If you were in that same context, you would see that people who show up at the polls are seen as more important than those who don’t. You would perceive those who can deliver entire voting blocs as more important still, and those who make the largest campaign contributions as most important of all. Citizens who do none of those things would likely get pushed to the periphery. — location: [1587](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C2IM&location=1587) ^ref-23436

But the biggest issue for our nation isn’t who funds it. In reality, it doesn’t make much of a difference whether the funding is paid directly through employers or via government taxes.

You might think that with their power and market clout, insurance companies would be able to restructure US health care delivery. However, historically, these “payers” have had very little influence over the provision of care. It’s not that they don’t want to improve performance at the care-delivery level.

---
The goal for insurers was to maximize profits by (1) encouraging relatively healthy people (cherries) to join a health plan, and (2) discouraging relatively sick people (lemons) from seeking coverage under the company’s plan. Insurers accomplished this by denying coverage to individuals with preexisting conditions and by denying reimbursement for as many health care services as possible, including maternity care. — location: [1774](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C2IM&location=1774) ^ref-30511

health insurers switched tactics in 2014 and began offering subscribers “narrow networks.” These new coverage options offer lower premiums in exchange for a reduced choice of care providers, anywhere from 30 to 70 percent fewer in-network physicians. — location: [1777](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LL8C2IM&location=1777) ^ref-49740

Theoretically, insurers could use this added influence to obtain concessions from doctors and hospitals that lead to greater savings for policyholders.
