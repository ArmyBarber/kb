## Highlights

The “fit of absence of mind,” to borrow Seeley’s famous phrase, was neither that Britain accidentally backed into its Indian empire nor that eighteenth-century Britons did not notice it happening; it was that the foundations of that empire rested in the hard ideological work of the emerging modern state to forget that its roots lay in a very different form of body politic. — location: [4838](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AAUBPBS&location=4838) ^ref-48482
