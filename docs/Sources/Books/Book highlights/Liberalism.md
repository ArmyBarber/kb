Is demanding ‘absolute obedience’, for an indeterminate period of time, from the overwhelming majority of humanity compatible with the liberal profession of faith? Or is it synonymous with ‘soi-disant’ liberalism? — location: [192](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EGMBK0C&location=192) ^ref-41093

In polemicizing against one another, the two branches the liberal party had divided into adopted the ideology and rhetoric that had presided over the self-celebration of the English nation in its entirety, as the sworn enemy of political slavery. — location: [241](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EGMBK0C&location=241) ^ref-51024

The self-styled champions of liberty branded taxation imposed without their explicit consent as synonymous with despotism and slavery.

It affords a curious spectacle to observe, that the same people who talk in a high strain of political liberty, and who consider the privilege of imposing their own taxes as one of the inalienable rights of mankind, should make no scruple of reducing a great proportion of their fellow-creatures into circumstances by which they are not only deprived of property, but almost of every species of right.

The first country to embark on the liberal road is one that exhibited an especially tenacious attachment to the institution of slavery.

the Puritans had initiated a massacre of the Indians, assimilated to ‘Canaanites and Amalekites’—that is, stocks marked out by the Old Testament for erasure from the face of the earth.

There is no doubt that, along with black enslavement and the black slave trade, the rise of the two liberal countries either side of the Atlantic involved a process of systematic expropriation and practical genocide first of the Irish and then of the Indians. — location: [450](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EGMBK0C&location=450) ^ref-19049

When he sought to challenge the march of civilization, violently opposing exploitation through labour of the uncultivated land occupied by him, the Indian, along with any other criminal, could be equated with ‘one of those wild savage beasts with whom men can have no society nor security’, and who ‘therefore may be destroyed as a lion or a tiger’. Locke never tired of insisting on the right possessed by any man to destroy those reduced to the level of ‘beasts of prey’, ‘savage beasts’; to the level of ‘a savage ravenous beast that is dangerous to his being’. — location: [539](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EGMBK0C&location=539) ^ref-50692

On the basis of the principles of self-government, each individual state has the right to regulate it as it sees fit, while every state’s obligation to return fugitive slaves is a moral obligation to guarantee a legitimate property-owner the services that ‘may be due’. — location: [572](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EGMBK0C&location=572) ^ref-2169

---
although regarded as legitimate in all three cases, the institution of slavery was theorized and affirmed without the least reticence solely by the Dutch author, whose life straddled the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In Locke, by contrast, at least in the case of the Two Treatises of Government, which were written and published on the eve and at the end of the Glorious Revolution, legitimation of slavery tends to occur exclusively between the lines of the discourse celebrating English liberty. The reticence reaches its peak in the documents that consecrate the foundation of the United States as the most glorious chapter in the history of liberty. — location: [583](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EGMBK0C&location=583) ^ref-50946

But it remains the case that in all three liberal revolutions the demand for liberty and justification of the enslavement, as well as the decimation (or destruction), of barbarians, were closely intertwined. — location: [591](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EGMBK0C&location=591) ^ref-39560

the paradoxical tangle we have encountered while historically reconstructing the origins of liberalism is disturbing. We can therefore understand the tendency to repression. After all, that was the gesture, in their own day, of Locke and, especially, the rebel American colonists, who liked to draw a more or less thick veil of silence over the institution of slavery. — location: [600](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EGMBK0C&location=600) ^ref-63305

Bodin concluded that ‘those who profess all these three religions only partially observe the law of God with regard to slaves’, as if the prohibition of this horrible institution only applied to blood relations, not humanity as a whole.

called for ‘mak[ing] slaves of all those who are unable to provide for their own subsistence’,139 Bodin also condemned slavery for ‘vagrants and idlers’.140 According to the observation of a great historian, it was in ‘the period between 1660 and 1760’ (the decades of the rise of the liberal movement) that an attitude of unprecedented harshness spread in England towards wage-labourers and the unemployed, ‘which has no modern parallel except in the behaviour of the less reputable of white colonists towards coloured labour’. — location: [717](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EGMBK0C&location=717) ^ref-23883

Recourse to vulgar historicism to ‘explain’ or repress the surprising tangle of freedom and oppression that characterizes the three liberal revolutions we have referred to is fruitless.

The wealth and leisure it enjoyed, and the culture it thus managed to acquire, reinforced the proud self-consciousness of a class that became ever more intolerant of the abuses of power, the intrusions, the interference and the constraints of political power or religious authority.

Sometimes freed by their masters, blacks slaves were long subjected to a condition not markedly dissimilar from that of indentured servants—that is, temporary white semi-slaves on a contractual basis. And it is this ambiguity that finds expression in the text of Grotius, who can hence also apply the category of contract to servitus perfecta. In Locke, by contrast, we can read the development which chattel slavery and racial slavery began to undergo from the late seventeenth century. — location: [1052](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EGMBK0C&location=1052) ^ref-59344

once again, the element of novelty emerges. Although rejecting an abolitionist interpretation of Christianity, Grotius repeatedly appealed to Christian literature to underscore the common humanity of servant and master, both of them subject to the Father in Heaven, and hence in a relationship with each another that was in some sense one of fraternity.32 The Second Treatise of Government is concerned, instead, to make it clear that the principle of equality applies exclusively to ‘creatures of the same species and rank’, — location: [1062](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EGMBK0C&location=1062) ^ref-23353

this view was wrong in the colonists’ view, because it confounded and assimilated free Englishmen, prison rabble and people of colour.

The process we are examining was the autonomization of the property of those who already enjoyed recognition, of those who aspired to form themselves into the community or caste of freemen. — location: [7581](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EGMBK0C&location=7581) ^ref-59872

In the England that emerged from the Glorious Revolution, the landed aristocracy consolidated its enjoyment of certain privileges (hunting, for example) and consecrated its political power in representative bodies—in the first instance, the House of Lords. — location: [7583](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EGMBK0C&location=7583) ^ref-19126

in the United States democracy emerged first because it emerged as a Herrenvolk democracy, as a ‘master-race democracy’, and this specific form proved so tenacious that it survived the Civil War by many decades. It is highly problematic to regard Herrenvolk democracy as complete political emancipation. — location: [7597](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EGMBK0C&location=7597) ^ref-40139

Was political emancipation more advanced in the North American republic, which saw slavery flourish in these years and which a little earlier had extended that institution to the Texas taken from Mexico? Or was political emancipation more advanced precisely in Mexico and those Latin American countries that had abolished the institution of slavery some decades before? — location: [7600](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EGMBK0C&location=7600) ^ref-59720

We cannot even unreservedly endorse Marx’s thesis that ‘[p]olitical emancipation is certainly a big step forward.’83 We already know that the most tragic chapter in the history of the Indians began with the American Revolution, and that the period between the Glorious Revolution and the American Revolution witnessed the emergence of a racial chattel slavery of unprecedented harshness. — location: [7605](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EGMBK0C&location=7605) ^ref-13265

a benevolent attitude towards the fascist coup d’état is not explicable solely by the severe social and political crisis of the time.

Jefferson raised the spectre of genocide in three very different contexts. He referred to ‘extermination’ in connection with the Indians as a process that was underway in the United States, could not be stopped, and was in fact to be attributed exclusively to the British. He pointed to the ‘extermination’ of the blacks as the inevitable outcome of the utopia of constructing a multiracial society. Finally, he experienced the clash with Britain as a total war, destined to issue in the ‘extermination’ of one of the contending parties — location: [8082](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EGMBK0C&location=8082) ^ref-27184

we certainly must bid farewell once and for all to the myth of the gradual, peaceful transition, on the basis of purely internal motivations and impulses, from liberalism to democracy, or from general enjoyment of negative liberty to an ever wider recognition of political rights. — location: [8093](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EGMBK0C&location=8093) ^ref-25352

the exclusion clauses were not overcome painlessly, but through violent upheavals of a sometimes quite unprecedented violence. The abolition of slavery in the wake of the Civil War cost the United States more victims than both world wars combined. — location: [8101](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EGMBK0C&location=8101) ^ref-8631

in addition to not being painless, the historical process that resulted in the advent of democracy was quite the reverse of unilinear. Emancipation—that is, the acquisition of rights previously not recognized or enjoyed—might well be followed by dis-emancipation—that is, deprivation of the rights whose recognition and enjoyment the excluded had won. — location: [8105](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EGMBK0C&location=8105) ^ref-45487

The process of emancipation very often had a spur completely external to the liberal world.

first slavery and then the terrorist regime of white supremacy were thrown into crisis by the San Domingo revolt and the October Revolution, respectively. The implementation of an essential principle, if not of liberalism then of liberal democracy (in the usual sense of the term), is inconceivable without the decisive contribution of two of the chapters of history most hated by the liberal culture of the time. — location: [8126](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EGMBK0C&location=8126) ^ref-14752

Liberalism has proved capable of learning from its antagonist (the tradition of thinking that, starting with ‘radicalism’ and passing through Marx, issued in the revolutions which variously invoked him) to a far greater extent than its antagonist has proved capable of learning from it. — location: [8143](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EGMBK0C&location=8143) ^ref-991

this limitation of power went hand in hand with the delimitation of a restricted sacred space: nurturing a proud, exclusivist self-consciousness, the community of the freemen inhabiting it was led to regard enslavement, or more or less explicit subjection, imposed on the great mass dispersed throughout the profane space, as legitimate. — location: [8148](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EGMBK0C&location=8148) ^ref-5832

the habitual hagiography is also an insult to the memory of the victims.
