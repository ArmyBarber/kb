## Highlights
Those targeted by this UN-sanctioned alliance are loosely associated groups representing a broad sweep of Yemeni society—almost 80 percent of the country’s population currently lives under these groups’ authority. — location: [152](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=152) ^ref-50945

---
The removal in late 2014 of Hadi’s ineffective interim administration was deemed by most Yemenis as entirely justified. — location: [157](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=157) ^ref-58243

---
AnsarAllah not only threw out a corrupt foreign imposed government filled with crooks and Islamist bigots, but they also reversed the selling of Yemen’s economic future. — location: [178](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=178) ^ref-43105

---
the constant reference to events in Yemen as a “civil war.” Framing events in this manner attempts to place the blame for these catastrophes on Yemenis themselves, a way of reading events that is not politically neutral. — location: [186](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=186) ^ref-50392

---
international organizations work overtime to confuse and cover up with clichés about Yemeni tribalism and Iranian-backed rebels. — location: [198](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=198) ^ref-32698

---
Until recently, Yemen could accommodate all comers, whether prophet or profiteer. — location: [234](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=234) ^ref-17812

---
Crucially, in as much as empire secures leverage by way of financially overwhelming targeted polities and when needed military coercion, it also harvested technology and the social sciences — location: [263](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=263) ^ref-56037

---
through its cultivation of higher education, in particular, that this modern empire produced the analytical frameworks to complement its violent methods of financial domination. With the establishment of the disciplines of economics, sociology, social anthropology, and political science, empire had the tools to indoctrinate generations of ambitious agents with theories of modernization, globalization, and neoliberalism. — location: [265](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=265) ^ref-51689

---
collusion between the major oil producers (OPEC) and empire assured the Federal Reserve Bank, a coalition of private banks, monopolized the means of exchange in the world (Hudson 2005). This constituted a power almost unique in human history, one Yemenis still resist well into the new millennium. — location: [276](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=276) ^ref-62449

---
Empire in the last two centuries is thus a product of a coalition of finance capitalists who have forged a global regime that until recently has been able to build, with virtually unlimited amounts of debt financing, the most powerful military machine ever known. — location: [278](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=278) ^ref-61067

---
a conflict that had, in some remarkable ways, originated as a mere land use dispute between local farmers and the Yemeni/Saudi states seeking to forcibly integrate the region’s assets into the global economy — location: [293](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=293) ^ref-14933

---
it was the ascendant Zaydi Imamate in North and Middle Yemen that resisted such encroachments of finance capitalism most. Their principled resistance resulted in one of the unique cases of indigenous, independent political order to survive World War II. — location: [306](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=306) ^ref-18089

---
That modernization theory, practiced with different levels of fanaticism, also required a generic image of the recipient as decidedly unmodern also plays itself out in dangerous ways in this story. — location: [376](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=376) ^ref-9686

---
The persistent reference to “the village” in anti-Soviet Cold War rhetoric almost entirely framed the social organization of the clear majority of poor people in the world as the quintessential den of communist recruitment. — location: [415](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=415) ^ref-42062

---
progressive Islamists whose agenda was a unification of a transregional struggle to defend the poor from capitalism — location: [436](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=436) ^ref-52681

---
the rise of Arab nationalism, which manifested in a productive, revolutionary way in the 1950s, was mediated as much as nurtured by Nasserism. — location: [438](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=438) ^ref-36263

---
In some ways, Nasser’s rise laid the foundations for the subsequent collapse of progressive resistance to global capitalism. — location: [441](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=441) ^ref-48271

---
Basically, more than 200,000 Yemenis would die over grudges between Egyptians and various Arabian princes. — location: [445](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=445) ^ref-31328

---
The other side was the imbrication of Islam, at the time still understood by many progressive Muslims as the best moral and socioeconomic framework to fight global capitalism. — location: [472](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=472) ^ref-4200

---
the partnership between empire and “conservative” Middle Eastern monarchies ultimately served the exploitative capitalist interests rather than protecting the global poor. — location: [475](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=475) ^ref-28742

---
the incremental uprooting of a radical, progressive, and perhaps even Islamic anti-imperialism — location: [477](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=477) ^ref-54911

---
this connection between empire and the rise of takfiri violence is lost in the scholarship as Yemen’s many crises are too often explained by the persistence of traditional behaviors, beliefs, and practices. — location: [494](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=494) ^ref-1110

---
In fact, for any “backward” society to change required that the residuals of a bygone era be quite literally wiped out. — location: [497](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=497) ^ref-26324

---
With the fall of the Soviet Union, the agenda was to encourage “decentralization” and push for privatizing state services and national resources that had only a generation earlier been violently nationalized at the behest of those same North Atlantic powers. — location: [514](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=514) ^ref-47358

---
the belief was that a radically transformed Muslim polity could become a useful coercive tool against noncompliant regimes like those found in both North Yemen and the recently independent South — location: [537](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=537) ^ref-30774

---
Those well-armed units unleashing death and destruction, almost entirely on fellow Muslims in Libya, Syria, Iraq, and Yemen itself, need scrutiny beyond serviceable phrases that instill fear in all the politically right places. — location: [545](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=545) ^ref-32686

---
the consequences of various countries harvesting this breed of terrorism has been most fully felt in Yemen itself. — location: [546](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=546) ^ref-15901

---
war on Yemen since March 2015 is not treated as a “civil war” but a by-product of finance capitalists’ mobilization of human and financial assets to assist in plundering Yemen’s wealth. — location: [562](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=562) ^ref-49161

---
The frustrations of these Yemeni masses with the failures of the Hadi interim government induced the well-armed, politically savvy, morally secure partisans of AnsarAllah, who also believed that they had no recourse but to take direct action on behalf of an unrepresented people. — location: [575](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=575) ^ref-13841

---
The resulting scramble for Africa in the 1870s and 1880s is, therefore, a byproduct of those earlier campaigns to secure political/commercial alliances with indigenous actors willing to diversify their own revenue streams — location: [691](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=691) ^ref-5777

---
the BEIC “outsourced” the expensive task of militarily subordinating locals to a British imperial state whose primary policy makers also became shareholders in the company — location: [695](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=695) ^ref-13122

---
starving Yemenis into submission has been a weapon since World War I, a fact informing Imam Yahya’s mistrust of the British ever since — location: [771](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=771) ^ref-54155

---
we appreciate the importance of local agency in the evolution of Yemen’s place in the larger world through the willingness of some Yemenis to collaborate with an emerging empire. — location: [778](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=778) ^ref-27664

---
it is clear Imam Yahya was no longer just a Zaydi imam. Many a community leader deep in so-called Shafi‘i Sunni territories in Middle Yemen identified Yahya’s expansive state as the best solution to what was promising to become an ugly power vacuum with the Ottoman departure. — location: [786](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=786) ^ref-18592

---
Unlike the post–Cold War period, as we see next with the Italians, rulers like Imam Yahya and Idrisi could still balance one suitor against another. — location: [797](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=797) ^ref-49197

the Kingdom of Italy, administering colonies on the East African coast since at least the 1880s — location: [820](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=820) ^ref-50776

---
By fortifying a treaty with the Italians, after perhaps years of cultivating a sense of mutual trust, the imam had secured North Yemen’s independence. — location: [830](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=830) ^ref-25459

---
The conclusions these expeditions starting in 1920 drew acknowledged that Yemen was enormously wealthy. Agriculturally rich and loaded with minerals, including petroleum, North Yemen deserved the immediate attention of the US government. — location: [876](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=876) ^ref-38732

---
North Yemen’s elites saw from their frequent interactions with the Americans and British that they were two sides of the same coin minted by empire. — location: [910](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=910) ^ref-22246

---
the most important tool of empire cultivated by British representatives of global capital since 1902 was the alliance forged with Saudi Arabia, an alliance at play then as today. — location: [914](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=914) ^ref-12322

---
Appreciating the origins of this conflict in the misappropriation of peoples’ livelihoods along the frontier is crucial to understanding Yemen today. — location: [1033](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=1033) ^ref-30047

While the Bolsheviks and Italians were the most useful in countering British efforts of sabotage in the interwar period, — location: [1099](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=1099) ^ref-25893

---
within months of the formal transfer of sovereignty over Najran and ‘Asir to the Saudis, Najdi colonialists began to push out natives, first by way of stealing prime land and then undermining local businesses by favoring to trade exclusively with those from the Saudi heartland. — location: [1124](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=1124) ^ref-32647

---
another case of some Yemenis marketing their own relative significance, a con job that remains a career choice in the Middle East, from Syria’s “moderate opposition,” Yemen’s own Islah crowd populated by MB apparatchiks, to those riding the Hadi coattail in exile since 2015. — location: [2227](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=2227) ^ref-2041

---
Largely driven by corrupted ideals now entirely justified in neoliberal jargon, the surrogates of empire delivering so much death and destruction on Yemen today have no other means to rationalize their actions than by simplistic references to Iran or evoking international law; the protection of minorities, women, and children; and most cynically, the need for “democracy” to flourish. — location: [3941](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=3941) ^ref-37310

increasingly forced to face open war or accept brutal austerity as global economic elites scramble for one last pillage. — location: [3965](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=3965) ^ref-27588

---
The “they are at war with themselves” trope continuously repeated in various media and academic circles ultimately obfuscates who are guilty, laying blame on eighty percent of a country’s population currently being starved to death. — location: [3997](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=3997) ^ref-57436

---
these same “Islamic” states also paid for tens of thousands of Contra-like mercenaries—in the past neo-fascist anti-communists, Al-Qaeda or ISIS these days—expected since World War II to enforce order in zones of resistance like Yemen. — location: [4017](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=4017) ^ref-19669

---
the current war, far from being a response to growing “Iranian” influence, a theme marketed heavily in both Arabic and Western media, was in fact a direct response to a changing political economic dynamic in Yemen. — location: [4019](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=4019) ^ref-57205

---
What is impossible to ignore and why Yemen will survive is that these regional players mobilizing such destructive forces are at war with each other. — location: [4031](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=4031) ^ref-9952

---
The extent to which many of the development projects mentioned throughout also had links to a boom in sex tourism, the desecration of Yemeni heritage, and even extensive environmental destruction explains a great deal of the kind of violence we are observing in Yemen. While this nefarious side of the globalization of Yemen has remained under the radar of scholars, until the war at least, many young men from the GCC had come to know Yemen as the Tijuana of Arabia. This, perhaps, is ultimately why Yemen’s neighbors are so willing to subject millions of Yemenis to an endless war: they have no empathy for them for they have exploited them, especially their children, for so long. — location: [4035](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=4035) ^ref-59352

---
It is a matter of time before Yemenis across a broad coalition put together the kind of organized resistance that will ultimately address their security problems. — location: [4051](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=4051) ^ref-1236

---
While it was possible to continue to divert the savings of the West’s working classes or inflate the global bond market for a short period longer, the real redeemer of empire, the wealth of the Third World, is increasingly no longer so cheaply plundered. — location: [4059](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077GRB21B&location=4059) ^ref-23860
