## Chapter 1: The Historical Background and Causes of the "Cultural Revolution"

### Highlight (yellow) - 1. The interaction between "Left" theory and "Left" practice > Location 142

the development of the "Left" trend of thought in the Chinese Communist Party after 1957 did indeed start from an improper assessment of the domestic class situation and a misjudgment of the main domestic contradiction.

### Highlight (yellow) - 1. The interaction between "Left" theory and "Left" practice > Location 146

The "Eighth National Congress" of the Communist Party of China held in 1956 pointed out in the resolution on the political report: "The main contradiction in our country is already the contradiction between the people's demand for the establishment of an advanced industrial country and the reality of a backward agricultural country, and it is already the people's desire to build an advanced industrial country. The contradiction between the need for rapid economic and cultural development and the current situation that the economy and culture cannot meet the needs of the people.

### Highlight (orange) - 1. The interaction between "Left" theory and "Left" practice > Location 150

The essence of this contradiction is the relationship between the advanced socialist system and the backward productive forces when the socialist system has been established in our country. Contradictions among them."

one of the most basic lessons that Mao Zedong concluded from the Hungarian incident is: "The basic problem in some Eastern European countries is that class struggle has not been done well." This will inevitably affect his analysis and decision on domestic conflicts and events in the future.

In March 1957, he said at the Tianjin Party cadre meeting: Now the work of class struggle is basically over. The so-called "basically ended" means not completely ended. It means that the large-scale, mass class struggle is basically ended, as mentioned in our "Eighth National Congress".

### Highlight (orange) - 1. The interaction between "Left" theory and "Left" practice > Location 214

The changes in the middle can be seen from the party directive "Organize Forces to Counter the Rampant Attacks of Rightists" drafted by Mao Zedong for the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on June 8, 1957. The document believes that in China, "there is a certain danger of a 'Hungarian incident'.

### Highlight (yellow) - 1. The interaction between "Left" theory and "Left" practice > Location 235

This passage is a fundamental change from the judgment on the main domestic contradictions at the “Eighth National Congress” held a year ago. Mao Zedong's erroneous conclusions about the main domestic contradictions were endorsed by the Central Plenary Session, which will inevitably lead to corresponding changes in the main tasks of the entire party and the entire policy. This is a major theoretical error and decision error.

According to statistics, since the first Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union has assisted China with a total of 304 projects. By the first half of 1960, 103 projects had been completed, and 201 projects were still under construction. When the Soviet experts withdrew, they took away all the drawings, plans and materials, and stopped the supply of important equipment urgently needed for construction, so that some major construction projects and scientific research projects were forced to stop or interrupt,

this great controversy convinced Mao Zedong that revisionism had come to power in the Soviet Union, and that the world's first socialist country created by Lenin had changed its color.

people like Khrushchev may come out. This has increased the sense of urgency to carry out the anti-revisionist and anti-revisionist struggle in China. Neither of these two aspects could not fail to have a profound impact on the subsequent historical process.

Zhou Enlai lodged a serious protest to the Soviet side, and Brezhnev had to apologize. This incident was linked to other circumstances, leading the Party Central Committee to conclude that what Brezhnev practiced was "Khrushchevism without Khrushchev".

until this time, Mao Zedong proposed the task of "anti-revision and prevention of revision" in the country, and the focus was still on "prevention of revision".

### Highlight (yellow) - 3. The interaction between international anti-revisionism and domestic anti-revisionism > Location 1017

When Mao Zedong made a completely unrealistic estimate of the political situation of the party and the country and the relationship between social classes, did not give an accurate explanation of what revisionism is, and adopted a wrong method, the original intention and serious consequences were inevitably formed. Deviation, this is where Mao Zedong's tragedy lies.

### Highlight (blue) - 3. The interaction between international anti-revisionism and domestic anti-revisionism > Location 1047

the danger of a revisionist restoration among all party members and cadres is not only real, but imminent, thus creating a general sense of urgent and strong political crisis. At the same time, a sense of historical mission to uphold Marxism-Leninism, oppose revisionism, and promote world revolution emerged spontaneously. This blind and fanatical belief was once an ideological motivation for many people to participate in the "Cultural Revolution".

### Highlight (blue) - 3. The interaction between international anti-revisionism and domestic anti-revisionism > Location 1062

this so-called struggle against modern revisionism, which focused on the great debate between the two parties in China and the Soviet Union, was indeed a strong catalyst and an important factor that effectively promoted the rapid expansion of the "Left" trend of thought in the Chinese Communist Party. And made direct ideological and theoretical preparations for the launch of the "Cultural Revolution".

the urgent consideration of changing the successor was indeed one of the reasons why Mao Zedong was determined to launch the "Cultural Revolution".

### Highlight (yellow) - 4. Going to extremes in the vicious circle of three interactions > Location 1138

Mao Zedong's philosophical thinking, that is, without distinguishing between different historical conditions, he consistently overemphasizes the relationship of production, the reaction of the superstructure, emphasizes the role of ideology, and advocates the use of revolution to promote production.

he regarded the differences within the party as more and more serious, regarded the differences in different methods of building socialism as the struggle between two classes and two roads, and regarded the "dark side" within the party and society more and more.

### Highlight (yellow) - 4. Going to extremes in the vicious circle of three interactions > Location 1260

as Mao Zedong was concerned, if what he wanted to achieve was to exclude certain comrades from the central leadership, according to his status and authority in the party at that time, he did not need to mobilize troops and launch the "Cultural Revolution".

It is a pity that this historical turning point was lost because Mao Zedong failed to fully understand the lessons of the Lin Biao incident and continued to misunderstand and insist on the "Left" line.

### Highlight (yellow) - 3. "Criticism of Lin Biao and Confucianism" > Location 5129

The fact that the "Gang of Four" is an enemy of the people has been deeply hated by the majority of cadres and the masses.

### Highlight (yellow) - 5. The death of Mao Zedong smashed the "Gang of Four" > Location 6516

Mao Zedong never handed over the supreme leadership of the party and the country to the "Gang of Four", and criticized and exposed them, alleviating the party's difficulties in this sharp struggle.

for more than 20 years, no one, including the party leader Mao Zedong, has made it clear what revisionism (including modern revisionism) is.

### Highlight (yellow) - 1. The serious consequences of the ten-year civil unrest > Location 6591

As a result of the "Cultural Revolution" against and against revisionism, China almost returned to the extreme autocratic rule of the feudal dynasty. This is a great historical irony.

### Highlight (yellow) - 1. The serious consequences of the ten-year civil unrest > Location 6664
