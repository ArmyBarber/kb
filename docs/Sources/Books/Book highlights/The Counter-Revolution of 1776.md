## Highlights
It is an error to view the history of colonial British North America as simply “pre-U.S. history” in a teleological manner. It is likewise useful to integrate events in the Caribbean into our contemplation of the mainland. — location: [57](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=57) ^ref-51533

---
North Americans had been trained to regard the southern mainland colonies as part of an extended Caribbean region that was a primary source of wealth. — location: [59](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=59) ^ref-35977

---
notorious edict of Lord Dunmore in November 1775 in Virginia, helped to push the colonists into open revolt by 4 July 1776. — location: [70](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=70) ^ref-22717

---
many Africans had different plans for the destiny of colonial North America that decidedly did not include a starring role by the now famed Founding Fathers and their predecessors but, instead, contemplated a polity led by themselves in league with the indigenous and, perhaps, a compliant European power. — location: [71](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=71) ^ref-34051

---
strikingly, as London was moving toward abolition, the republic was supplanting the British isles as the kingpin of the global slave trade. — location: [78](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=78) ^ref-27352

---
I do not view the creation of the republic as a great leap forward for humanity—though I concede readily that it improved the lives of a countless number of Europeans. — location: [81](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=81) ^ref-52531

---
as 4 July 1776 approached, Africans had been involved steadily in the poisoning and murdering and immolating of settlers, creating (at least) a yawning deficit of trust between Africans and Europeans. — location: [84](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=84) ^ref-40902

Defenders of the so-called Confederate States of America were far from bonkers when they argued passionately that their revolt was consistent with the animating and driving spirit of 1776.13 — location: [101](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=101) ^ref-49918

---
slavery was both a boost for nascent capitalism and ultimately a fetter on its productive force. — location: [105](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=105) ^ref-35066

---
their triumph forged a conflation of anti-monarchism, and republicanism—and Africans standing in the way of the two—in a manner that virtually guaranteed that the path ahead would be exceedingly rocky for those who became U.S. Negroes, then African Americans. — location: [130](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=130) ^ref-14623

---
“Africans here and abroad unite and fight in league with a powerful foreign ally.” Such a conclusion inferentially suggests a design flaw at the heart of the republic—Africans being excluded and persecuted not by accident but purposively—that compels this sizeable class of citizens to disregard republican sovereignty in pursuit of justice. — location: [136](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=136) ^ref-23945

as a putative descendant of mainland Africans who had fought the formation of a slaveholding republic, then a Jim Crow regime, I was continuing to incur a penalty as a result, this time in the form of having to walk part of the way to my next destination. — location: [151](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=151) ^ref-6845

---
the uniting of Europeans from varying ethnicities under the umbrella of “whiteness” broadened immeasurably the anti-London project, with a handsome payoff delivered to many of the anti-colonial participants in the form of land that once was controlled by the indigenous, often stocked with enslaved Africans—not to mention a modicum of civil rights denied to those who were not defined as “white.” — location: [214](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=214) ^ref-7493

the founders of the republic have been hailed and lionized by left, right, and center for—in effect—creating the first apartheid state. — location: [217](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=217) ^ref-35803

The “Puritan colonies,” says Greene, “were the greatest slave-trading communities in America. From Boston, Salem and Charlestowne in Massachusetts; from Newport, Providence and Bristol in Rhode Island; and from New London and Hartford” — location: [259](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=259) ^ref-23336

---
in the fifteen years prior to 1698, slavers transported close to fifty-five hundred enslaved Africans to the North American mainland, and in the fifteen years after, the figure increased dramatically to more than fifteen thousand. The heralded reforms flowing in the aftermath of 1688 were as important to slave-trade escalation as the reforms of 1832 were to slave emancipation. — location: [279](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=279) ^ref-44558

---
This enormous influx of Africans laid the foundation for the concomitant growth of capitalism. The advent of this system has been seen widely and schematically as a leap forward from the strictures of feudalism and, therefore, a great leap forward for humanity as a whole. — location: [283](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=283) ^ref-44952

the immense profit and productivity (and devastation) that accompanied “free trade”—but this time in Africans. — location: [287](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=287) ^ref-9992

---
The enormous influx of Africans—and the settlers’ intoxication with the wealth they produced—meant that more “whites” had to be attracted to the continent to countervail the ferocity of the fettered labor force, and ultimately, an expanded set of rights for these European migrants, along with land seized from the indigenous, was critical in enticing them. — location: [297](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=297) ^ref-63315

---
politics virtually preordained that various island factions would seek the support of Africans—notably as their numbers escalated in the 18th century. — location: [335](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=335) ^ref-26505

The presumed unreliability of the Irish and Scots facilitated London’s increased reliance on African soldiers and sailors. — location: [353](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=353) ^ref-46269

---
in 1768 that Bostonians were treated to the sight of Afro-Caribbean drummers of the 29th Regiment actually punishing their fellow “white” soldiers. In the heart of Boston Commons, these Negroes whipped about ten alleged miscreants for various misdeeds. — location: [354](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=354) ^ref-21343

---
London felt compelled to rely upon Negro soldiers and sailors, as the colonists came to rely upon Negro slaves: this was becoming an unbridgeable chasm. The Crown—the sovereign in both London and the colonies—had created a highly combustible political volcano. — location: [366](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=366) ^ref-26136

---
Ultimately, the mainland model based on “racial” privilege overwhelmed the London model based on “ethnic” privilege. London’s “ethnic” approach implicitly—at times explicitly—sacrificed the interests of Irish and Scots and Welsh (and even the English of certain class backgrounds) and made up for the shortfall by seeking to attract Africans to the banner, a policy propelled not least by competition with Madrid. — location: [371](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=371) ^ref-24437

---
such a policy could only alienate mainland settlers, driving them toward a unilateral declaration of independence on 4 July 1776. — location: [375](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=375) ^ref-22798

---
the term “white”—the vector of a potently rising identity politics still operative centuries later—only began to supplant “Christian” and “free” as favored designations in the 1690s, — location: [378](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=378) ^ref-43058

---
the privilege of “whiteness” was based heavily upon the increased presence of Africans, but since mainlanders were coming to suspect that London would deploy the Negroes against them—or, at least, had a more expansive view of their deployment than settlers—this meant that independence in 1776 was tied up with complicated, even fearful, sentiments about humans designated as slaves. This expansion in the colonies fueled by enslavement of Africans then undergirded the conflict with London that erupted in 1776. — location: [381](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=381) ^ref-52454

---
Madrid’s reliance upon Africans in the Americas may have seemed less risky than reliance upon men with roots in Catalonia. — location: [424](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=424) ^ref-20721

---
from 1756 to 1763, London fought an expensive and largely successful war against Paris and Madrid to oust the latter two from a good deal of North America to the benefit of the colonists, then sought to raise taxes to pay for this gigantic venture—only to have the settlers go behind the back of London and conspire with Spain and France against Britain. — location: [498](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=498) ^ref-18477

---
before 1763, mainland settlers were huddling in fear of Negro insurrection combined with foreign invasion, particularly from Spanish Florida or, possibly, French Canada; afterward, it appeared to a number of colonists—particularly as abolitionist sentiment grew in London—that Negro insurrection would be coupled with a throttling of the colonies by redcoats, many of them bearing an ebony hue. — location: [507](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=507) ^ref-53757

---
The traditional narrative of the republic’s founding has emphasized insufficiently the amorality and trans-border ethos that came to define capitalism—which often was at odds with traditional notions of patriotism and even sovereignty. — location: [514](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=514) ^ref-51873

---
by 1764, he owed one of his London creditors a still hefty eighteen hundred pounds sterling74 and certainly had an incentive to both preserve his slave property and escape from the Crown which seemed to be calling it into question. — location: [524](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=524) ^ref-40493

---
As June 1772 approached, beating slaves was much less common in London than in the colonies. Increasingly, Londoners were beginning to see slavery and slaveholders as an American phenomenon that sophisticated metropolitans disdained as uncivilized— — location: [538](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=538) ^ref-16444

---
In 1775, a leading British official proposed that London was willing to return to the status quo ante of 1763 with regard to taxes and the like if the settlers would concur with the notion that slavery was a “vice” that was “contrary to the law of God” and, thus, “every slave in North America should be entitled to his trial by jury in all criminal cases … as a foundation to extirpate slavery from the face of earth”; — location: [544](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=544) ^ref-28870

“let the only contention hence forward between Great Britain and America be, which shall exceed the other in zeal for establishing the fundamental rights of liberty to all mankind.” — location: [547](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=547) ^ref-32062

---
Ian Smith—the leader of the newly founded racist republic that was Rhodesia (which became Zimbabwe in 1980)—argued that his Unilateral Declaration of Independence was a replay of 1776: he and his comrades were seeking to escape the logic of decolonization, just as 1776 sought to escape the logic of slavery’s abolition. — location: [555](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=555) ^ref-46664

---
The rebels of 1776 were victorious and have been hailed widely ever since, suggesting that there is something to be said for winning in the shaping of history’s judgment of a rebellion. — location: [560](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=560) ^ref-16129

---
Blas Roca, a leader of what became the Communist Party in Cuba, then in a desperate confrontation with Washington, asked a question not often posed in Washington: why, he asked, was the plight of Negroes in the U.S. probably worse than that of any other group of Africans in the hemisphere? — location: [562](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=562) ^ref-64121

---
unlike in Cuba, where the anti-colonial and anti-slavery struggles merged, in the person of Antonio Maceo,83 or in Mexico, where an early leader was of African descent, Vicente Guerrero,84 in what became the U.S., there was a divergence between the struggle against London and the struggle for abolition— — location: [564](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=564) ^ref-47578

---
one of the more striking aspects of the anti-London struggle on the mainland was how often it merged with a “Black Scare” in the form of the imprecations tossed at Lord Dunmore and Governor Martin of North Carolina. — location: [569](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=569) ^ref-63095

---
it is difficult to ignore the point that one central reason for this awful persecution has been the simple fact that this besieged group had their own ideas about the configuration of North America and that their conceptions often involved collaboration with the antagonists of Euro-American elites (be they indigenes, Madrid, or ultimately London). — location: [576](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=576) ^ref-58847

---
it was not until the 1950s that Washington came to realize that, perhaps, easing racist oppression at home might serve to foil such dangerous diplomatic alliances—until then, such relations served partially to provide further grist for the oppressive mill. — location: [581](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=581) ^ref-3095

in no small part from their historically consistent and staunch opposition to the capacious plans of slaveholding rebel—then republican—elites, which too often targeted these very same Africans. — location: [584](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=584) ^ref-17620

---
Increasingly, settlers were referring to their principal labor force as “intestine” enemies, a deadly threat that could not be easily expelled or digested. — location: [614](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=614) ^ref-50466

---
The colony’s free Negro population was effectively expelled, which narrowed the base of support for the colonial project, necessitating the importation of—perhaps—more unsteady Scots and Irish. A decade earlier, the authorities in recently claimed Jamaica already were hedging against the possibility of an African “mutiny.” — location: [629](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=629) ^ref-38901

---
the planters were instructed to “take care to provide themselves with one white servant for every ten Negroes on their plantations”—but left unsaid was where these “whites” would be found who would be sufficiently intrepid to reside among angry insurrectionists.13 Almost through absence of mind but actually driven by the desperation of mere survival, the base of support for colonialism was expanded to include groups often disfavored in London itself—for example, those who were Jewish and the Irish—now admitted into the hallowed halls of a form of colonial “whiteness.” — location: [640](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=640) ^ref-42475

---
the ineluctable adaptation in the colonies was a grouping together of Europeans in the evolving “racial” category that was “whiteness”: this process facilitated the degradation and subjugation of a recalcitrant African labor force. — location: [646](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=646) ^ref-17754

---
authorities in Barbados quickly moved to increase the “supply of servants from Scotland to strengthen the island against the outrages of the Negroes”—but casting increasingly restive Scots into this turmoil was not necessarily a formula for calm repose. — location: [649](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=649) ^ref-997

---
That the Irish could—and did—defect to “Catholic” invaders did little to dissuade the developing notion that, perhaps, the mainland, with a more diverse and substantial European population, was a preferable site for investment. — location: [679](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=679) ^ref-32023

---
In the overriding context of Catholic-Protestant conflict, seizing more Africans for enslavement, while trying to incorporate Irish and other dissidents in the superseding category of “whiteness,” made sense— — location: [689](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=689) ^ref-15547

---
London encouraged migration of Sephardim to Jamaica, and just as the Spanish had co-opted countless Africans on English soil, the English returned the favor with the Iberian Jews. — location: [697](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=697) ^ref-24904

---
just as London was forced to try to protect Africans under its jurisdiction from often harsh measures by settlers, English elites in the metropolis had to act similarly in Jamaica in overriding special taxes against Jews pursued by local elites. — location: [698](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=698) ^ref-27584

“Few slave societies,” argues social historian Orlando Patterson, “present a more impressive record of slave revolts than Jamaica,” — location: [708](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=708) ^ref-28135

---
It is easy to infer that the colonizers came to recognize that simultaneous enslavement of Europeans and Africans was too formidable a task and that narrowing bondage to the latter was more practicable. — location: [747](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=747) ^ref-35434

---
the construction of “whiteness” or the forging of bonds between and among European settlers across class, gender, ethnic, and religious lines was a concrete response to the real dangers faced by all of these migrants in the face of often violent rebellions from enslaved Africans and their indigenous comrades. — location: [750](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=750) ^ref-38986

fleeing Europeans “must of necessity fall in a short time into the hands of the Enemy from abroad or the Negroes from within”—neatly encapsulating the internal and external dilemmas faced by the colonizer. — location: [770](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=770) ^ref-7006

Frenchman Robert Cavelier de la Salle was confident that “Mulattoes, Indians and Negroes” once promised their liberty would assist Paris in driving the Spanish from Mexico. — location: [791](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=791) ^ref-36038

---
by the late 17th century, the colonizing project presupposed enslavement of Africans, but, simultaneously, to gain an advantage against a European competitor could involve arming Africans, which could lead gradually away from the degradation that enslavement dictated—and, ultimately, toward abolition. — location: [794](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=794) ^ref-3545

---
Late 17th-century realities were seemingly contradictory: arming Africans and enslaving Africans; incorporating religious dissidents and ousting religious dissidents. By 1684, realization of the racial stakes at play was slowly dawning on at least one Londoner, who wondered pensively, should a “man be made a slave forever merely because his beard is Red or his Eyebrows Black?” — location: [801](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=801) ^ref-30621

The point-counterpoint between enthusiasm for the wealth that slavery generated and apprehension about the bloodiness it engendered was reflected in a legal zigzag. — location: [814](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=814) ^ref-43273

---
as African rebelliousness surged, the besieged planter class of Barbados began a great trek to the mainland. By the late 17th century, Caribbean settlers and their enslaved Africans from this sugar island were trickling into Newport. — location: [825](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=825) ^ref-11011

1686, the Spanish from Florida had landed with a force of Africans and indigenes to launch a surprise attack on the Carolina settlers. — location: [846](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=846) ^ref-38210

---
That Carolina was facing an ongoing conflict with the indigenous that created a flood of African refugees heading southward to Florida only served to underline the fragility of this extension of Barbados on the mainland. — location: [856](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=856) ^ref-13058

because of the threat from the indigenous and European powers, the colonists were forced into the ultimate indignity—arming Africans, a textbook example of tempting fate. — location: [906](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=906) ^ref-47202

After this revolt, religion and “race”—which pointedly excluded Africans—helped to bond the colonial elite and European servants. — location: [926](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=926) ^ref-36652

The reluctance of Africans to be subdued mandated an increase in the settler population, which meant ushering previously disfavored Europeans into the warm embrace of “whiteness,” and these migrants were enticed by heady dreams of prosperity driven by a slave society and a complement of rights—doled out via apartheid. — location: [1026](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=1026) ^ref-29978

a dominant theme of the 1756 war, which makes it a virtual dress rehearsal for the 1776 conflict, was the repeated accusation that settlers were double-dealing, collaborating with the French, as redcoats fought them. — location: [3646](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=3646) ^ref-62922

The 1756 war seemed to conclude with a smashing victory for London. Though popularly much of the subsequent analysis has focused on the ouster of France from Quebec, in terms of the slavery that provided propulsion to the mainland, the ouster of Spain from Florida (and from Cuba for a while) was decidedly more profound. — location: [3713](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=3713) ^ref-1918

---
The 1756 war, in short, lit a fuse that then exploded in a revolt against the Crown in 1776. Likewise—and not unrelated—was the changed circumstance for captive Africans, who continued arriving by the boatload on the mainland but now found weakened rear bases in Quebec and St. Augustine, previously used to launch punishing attacks against British settlements. — location: [3732](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=3732) ^ref-62303

Colonists should have applauded in 1772 when the regime in Virginia sought to impose taxes on imported Africans, even if they were arriving from Maryland and the Carolinas, for this was effectively limiting the numbers of those who could slit their throats—but some were too blind to see. — location: [4449](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=4449) ^ref-32748

A proposal emerged in Parliament as early as January 1775 calling for the abolition of slavery and thus “humbling the high aristocratic spirit of Virginia and the southern colonies.”140 It was also in November 1775 that a remarkable debate erupted in Parliament as to whether “all the slaves in America should have the trial by jury.” A formal motion was introduced on this terribly fraught matter, accompanied by a proviso to “annul all laws” on the mainland to the contrary. — location: [4673](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=4673) ^ref-6012

Suppressing African resistance became a crucial component of forging settler unity—and the solidifying identity that was “whiteness,” which cut prodigiously across religious, ethnic, class, and gender lines.

that it is much too generous to conclude that the former slaveholding republic has suffered from a tragic flaw: it is more accurate to aver that this polity has suffered from a design flaw, that is, that it was not accidental that the fabled founders somehow “forgot” to include all of the former colonies’ denizens in its bounty.

to suggest blithely, as some have, that 1776 created a template for the subsequent extensions of liberty to those who were initially excluded is similar to giving the jailers of apartheid credit for the enfranchisement of Nelson Mandela, while eliding neatly the stark commonalities that have linked white supremacy on both sides of the Atlantic. — location: [5069](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00J8DOMIG&location=5069) ^ref-8985
