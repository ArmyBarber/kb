## Highlights
Historical capitalism (there is no other except in the unreal world of liberal doctrine) merges with the history of world conquest by Europeans and their descendants, who made the United States and Canada and Australia. This conquest was victorious for four centuries—from 1492 to 1914—before which the resistance of victim peoples had always failed. — location: [8369](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07KCL4LNB&location=8369) ^ref-3880

Class struggles in the North have primarily been focused on economic demands that, in general, do not call into question either the ownership of capital or the imperialist world order. — location: [8390](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07KCL4LNB&location=8390) ^ref-2910

What are the conditions in which the countries of the North might very well move away from the path on which they embarked five centuries ago, that is, the continuing war against the peoples of the South and no less permanent wars among themselves to determine distribution of the spoils? — location: [8490](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07KCL4LNB&location=8490) ^ref-36821

I have explained why I do not see how the wind of change could find its point of departure in the “most advanced” center of capitalism.62 This is so precisely because the “perfection” of the capitalist model means that the people here are, as a whole, deeply alienated in a political culture dominated by the idea that the “market is king” and by the illusion that the “individual” is also king. The power of the vulgar ideology of capitalism, here accepted by everyone, then makes possible the particular vulgarity of the ruling class. — location: [8509](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07KCL4LNB&location=8509) ^ref-36524

the dominant class in the United States to manage the society in its exclusive interest, by formidable means that combine cynicism in action with extreme hypocrisy in rhetoric. — location: [8521](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07KCL4LNB&location=8521) ^ref-1528

nothing indicates that the American people are capable of realizing the tragedy inherent in the outrageous and criminal project of this junta—military control of the planet— — location: [8526](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07KCL4LNB&location=8526) ^ref-24430

expressing this viewpoint immediately earns you the label of “simple-minded anti-American,” a facile anathema that illustrates the cowardly capitulation of media-friendly intellectuals. — location: [8530](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07KCL4LNB&location=8530) ^ref-18562

behind this facade of plastic kitsch, there is still a people, in spite of its political stupidity. — location: [8542](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07KCL4LNB&location=8542) ^ref-54846

American people are one of only three (with the French and the Swedes) who reacted to the 1930s crisis by moving to the left. — location: [8547](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07KCL4LNB&location=8547) ^ref-4412

I have always thought that the devastating effects of internal colonialism exceeded those of external colonialism. The slavery practiced in the United States thus produced terrible effects compared with those caused by the slavery practiced by Europeans in distant colonies. — location: [8559](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07KCL4LNB&location=8559) ^ref-63853

Among other things, an “inferiority complex” in relation to China seems to return frequently. We have messed up our modernization, having aped the Westerners; the Chinese will do better — location: [8617](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07KCL4LNB&location=8617) ^ref-36710
