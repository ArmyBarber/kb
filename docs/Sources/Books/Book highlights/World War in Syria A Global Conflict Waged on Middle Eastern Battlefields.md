## Highlights
Multiple subsequent coups and countercoups were launched in Syria over the next 22 years, with three occurring in March, August and December 1949 followed by further coups in 1954, 1961, 1963 and 1970. The first was engineered by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) against the government of President Shukri Al Quwatli. — location: [175](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=175) ^ref-42975

Al Quwatli was then re-elected in 1955, and his administration distanced itself from the West as a result of the CIA’s involvement in the original March 1949 coup. — location: [184](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=184) ^ref-47061

While the Soviet Union showed no such intolerance towards neutral states in the third world, the contrast between this and the absolutism of Western policy led neutral states to consistently be forced to align themselves with Moscow for protection against Western threats. — location: [200](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=200) ^ref-65305

---
Syria’s unwillingness under multiple successive governments to become a Western client state and abandon its independence in foreign policymaking made a close security partnership between Moscow and Damascus inevitable — location: [206](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=206) ^ref-20530

the rapid industrialization of the USSR in the 1930s had seen it emerge as a leading arms manufacturer with weaponry equalling and in many cases surpassing the quality of its Western counterparts. — location: [270](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=270) ^ref-57027

One of the keys to the Arab nationalist states’ defeat in the conflict was their faith in the solidarity of the Western-aligned Arab monarchies, which proved to be their undoing on multiple occasions. — location: [388](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=388) ^ref-34960

Western client states such as Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Jordan, ruled by kings who relied on Western patronage to retain power, were natural allies of pro-Western Israel and natural adversaries of Soviet-backed Syria and Egypt. — location: [401](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=401) ^ref-46156

arguably never an Arab-Israeli struggle so much as there was a struggle between those states which accepted Western hegemony, including Israel, the Arab monarchies and the republics of Lebanoniii and Tunisia, and those nationalist Arab states which rejected subjugation to Western interests. — location: [403](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=403) ^ref-27410

Syria faced threats to its sovereignty on a third front from the Muslim Brotherhood, which came as part of a much broader trend under which Islamist militants came to target Western adversaries across the world in the late Cold War years — location: [545](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=545) ^ref-58652

---
The following decade Israeli and Western experts would notably highlight the presence of radical Islamist elements as an asset to undermine Damascus which “would not be difficult to operate again” and offered “increased U.S. opportunities for destabilization activities if this form of pressure proves necessary.” — location: [558](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=558) ^ref-26258

In the early 1980s the U.S. National Security Council notably published a paper titled ‘The Destabilisation of Syria’ in which a range of options to increase pressure on the Middle Eastern state and if possible to topple its government were explored. — location: [576](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=576) ^ref-16501

“When he broke with the Soviets in 1974, Sadat put all the sophisticated Soviet weaponry Egypt’s armed forces possessed at the disposal of America. The damage this did to the Arab cause was incalculable; its effects will be felt for years.” — location: [597](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=597) ^ref-36897

Threats posed by the Western Bloc, by Israel as a major Western client, and by jihadist forces, were all connected in that all were working to further the interests of Western hegemony over the Middle East. — location: [600](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=600) ^ref-27314

Syrian S-200s were reportedly successful in downing three U.S. Navy combat jets in a single day on December 4, 1983, which was the first time an Arab state had directly confronted the U.S. militarily. — location: [663](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=663) ^ref-22541

---
the Lebanon War cemented Syria’s emerging partnership with the Islamic Republic of Iran, and although ideologically very distant the two shared several common enemies and remained the only major actors in the region outside the Western sphere of influence. — location: [678](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=678) ^ref-31145

---
Syria would move to cement defence ties with North Korea, Iran and Hezbollah – the latter two despite very considerable ideological differences – to strengthen its position. With the deterioration of its conventional forces in the 1990s, Korean support in particular was key to providing some form of deterrent against the massive Western, Israeli and Turkish forces situated near its borders through asymmetric means. — location: [716](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=716) ^ref-59744

There was an irony to the fact that the pretext for American military intervention against Iraq, which proved to be entirely fabricated, was key to deterring such intervention against Syria. — location: [819](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=819) ^ref-10523

---
A number of factors made Hezbollah’s war with Israel a highly consequential event. It was the first major incident of successful armed resistance on a significant scale to the Western-led order after the Cold War’s end, and along with Russia’s victory over Western-aligned Georgia two years later in defiance of European and American demands it marked the end of the unipolar world order under which Western power had been unchallenged. — location: [831](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=831) ^ref-47211

A key material facilitator of the Lebanese militia’s victory was its heavily fortified and extremely large network of tunnels and bunkers, which were constructed by North Korean experts154 — location: [836](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=836) ^ref-10293

---
Following Hezbollah’s 2006 victory, the urgent need to weaken the ‘Axis of Resistance’ by targeting Syria scuppered Western plans to wait for a gradual Gorbachev-style shift in Syria under the new Assad government. — location: [882](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=882) ^ref-51774

The Western Bloc countries have partnered with and provided considerable assistance to radical Islamist militant groups to destabilise those countries outside the Western sphere of influence, including both neutral and Soviet-aligned states, for decades. — location: [1368](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=1368) ^ref-51281

Although Indonesian leader Sukarno had crushed communist efforts to seize power in the country, he ran a developmentalist and largely centrally planned economy and resisted Western pressure to ban the Partai Komunis Indonesia (PKI - communist party) from running in elections. — location: [1382](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=1382) ^ref-18128

The value of a partnership with Islamist groups would become clear in 1965, when a Western backed military coup saw Islamist militants play a major role in purging those suspected of being unsympathetic to the new pro-Western government in Jakarta. — location: [1404](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=1404) ^ref-39679

American groups such as the Federation for American-Afghan Action, Free the Eagle, the Committee for a Free Afghanistan, and the Freedom Research Foundation, many with close ties to U.S. intelligence, played a key role in lobbying Congress for more direct American action. They also took the lead in influencing media outlets in the West and the Muslim world to cover the insurgency sympathetically. — location: [1482](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=1482) ^ref-5595

Pakistan’s role in Afghanistan would have close parallels in the Syrian War, where more modern variants of the F-16 used by Turkey and Israel similarly forayed into the target state’s airspace to provide air support to Western-backed insurgents. Turkey would also embed special forces45 with jihadist militants in Syria and was responsible for handling arms transfers to them46 and providing them safe haven on its territory,47 in close coordination with the U.S., almost exactly as Pakistan had in Afghanistan. — location: [1513](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=1513) ^ref-47960

---
A particularly notable feature of the Afghan War, which would closely mirror the case in Syria years later, was the importance of Western global media in shaping its outcome. This allowed the West to frame the insurgency to the world as a virtuous cause against evil, rather than as terrorism, and to discredit Soviet narratives regarding the nature of their intervention. — location: [1527](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=1527) ^ref-32561

Had the U.S. and its allies not intervened to support the Afghan insurgency, there is a very significant possibility that the USSR would not have dispatched its armed forces to Afghanistan. — location: [1531](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=1531) ^ref-34848

America’s chief Balkans peace negotiator, Richard Holbrooke, himself testified that deployment of jihadists from Afghanistan played a key role in ensuring the survival of Western-aligned local militias in that conflict. — location: [1544](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=1544) ^ref-21972

An understanding of the means used to destabilise Indonesia, Afghanistan, Yugoslavia and Russia, therefore, is vital to placing later efforts to effect similar change in Syria in the context of broader trends in U.S. — location: [1591](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=1591) ^ref-18347

In the context of inter-state relations, information warfare has often involved the manipulation of public opinion by an enemy state in line with that offending state’s interest. — location: [1613](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=1613) ^ref-52354

Western information warfare offensives in Syria must therefore be understood as part of a revolution in the Western way of war, capitalising on new technologies such as social media to find new ways of targeting adversary states by directly accessing their populations. — location: [1636](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=1636) ^ref-52842

Syria’s relative isolation from the Western economies, however, meant that although the fallout from the 2008 crisis was significant, it was still much smaller than that affecting Western client states such as the gulf countries and Egypt. — location: [1704](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=1704) ^ref-17480

not only were uprisings against the Syrian state from March 2011 closely connected to Western NGOs, where the leaders of several anti-government groups had received extensive training, but the U.S. Congress and State Department had worked with tech giants to strengthen these operations. — location: [1749](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=1749) ^ref-19413

Google Maps, for example, renamed various streets in government-controlled Damascus after jihadist leaders, wiping the internationally and UN recognised Syrian government off the map as a result. — location: [1770](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=1770) ^ref-48235

Western social media platforms have proven to be highly effective tools for social engineering to promote both Westphilian narratives portraying the West and Western-aligned parties positively, and narratives which demonize or otherwise undermine faith in political actors or ideologies targeted by the West. — location: [1800](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=1800) ^ref-7208

The Obama-era State Department was fully aware that the gulf was providing massive material support to the Iraqi Al Qaeda branch for operations in Syria, which suited Washington’s interests well. — location: [1833](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=1833) ^ref-28360

Syria thus faced pressure not only from domestic conditions, but also from very mature and sophisticated information warfare operations and from a jihadist movement at the height of its power which the Western world was able to effectively manipulate. — location: [1844](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=1844) ^ref-40596

one common factor underlying every rationale for targeting Syria was the country’s position as an independent state under a single ruling party which was outside the Western sphere of influence. — location: [1848](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=1848) ^ref-22290

The second rationale for war was the need to isolate Iran and cripple Hezbollah, which was the primary casus belli involving the interests of Israel and the Gulf states as leading Western regional allies. — location: [1862](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=1862) ^ref-12961

taking Syria which was geographically central out of the picture had the potential to break this axis without direct military confrontation – destroying Hezbollah without the need for another war in Lebanon and leaving Iran almost totally isolated in the region. — location: [1872](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=1872) ^ref-28465

The third rationale for war was largely economic and pertained to Western intentions both to isolate Iran and to develop alternative sources of natural gas for Europe to that provided by Russia. — location: [1883](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=1883) ^ref-35011

He stated that the Western powers not only had failed to take any action against IS in Afghanistan, but also indicated that the terror group was receiving direct Western support. He recalled regarding IS in Afghanistan: “from the two years onwards to today, every day the local people, the local elders, government officials, media and others began to report that unmarked foreign helicopters, would go in and support extremists in all parts of the country… there’s a lot of evidence, unfortunately, that shows that these extremist forces are supplied from the foreign bases within Afghanistan.” — location: [1920](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=1920) ^ref-866

Despite Syria’s secular government and Sunni majority both among the population and in government, the sectarian paradigm promoted in the West for viewing regional conflict framed it as a collaborator with the Shiite world due to its position in the Axis of Resistance and its joint stance with Iran and Hezbollah against Western regional hegemony. — location: [2387](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=2387) ^ref-62499

---
The outbreak of a jihadist insurgency in Syria in 2011, spear-headed by groups linked to the Muslim Brotherhood and various Al Qaeda branches, was thus long in the making, and directly resulted from the Bush administration’s strategic shift to make preparations for confrontation with the ‘Axis of Resistance.’ — location: [2406](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=2406) ^ref-23682

Britain, France, the U.S., Turkey and Jordan had all deployed special forces to Syrian territory to support the covert military campaign, which was largely shielded from view by the chaos of mass protests. — location: [2490](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=2490) ^ref-47260

There was little illusion among Syria’s foreign adversaries that mass protests could topple the Ba’ath Party by themselves, with the protesting minority, no matter how well trained and vocal their organisers were, still relegated to outlying areas and holding few prospects of gaining support in the capital. What the protests did achieve, however, was to create enough confusion and disruption to allow Western-trained militants flowing across the borders to make serious gains. — location: [2492](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=2492) ^ref-36454

The dominance of jihadist elements in the insurgency from its earliest days closely reflected the trend in Afghanistan, where there had been a small secular Maoist insurgency against the government which had clashed with the Soviet military. These non-Islamist militants could not be credited with even a single percentage of Afghan government or Soviet battlefield losses. — location: [2511](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=2511) ^ref-24490

It was far from uncommon from the war’s earliest stages for crimes such as massacres to be blamed unanimously by Western media on the Syrian government or its partners, only for it to later emerge, often through investigations by Western reporters on the ground, that FSA insurgents were responsible. — location: [2533](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=2533) ^ref-27402

ceasefires strongly benefitted jihadist groups and allowed them to cement their control over newly occupied territories and strengthen their power bases within Syria’s borders. The conflict escalated from October 2012, following the failure of the last of the ceasefire agreements, with insurgent groups making major gains on all fronts, which led to particularly fierce fighting in the Turkish border regions. — location: [2766](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=2766) ^ref-47126

North Korea’s defence partnership with Syria dates back over half a century, with its armed forces, the Korean People’s Army (KPA), fighting alongside the Syrian Arab Army in all its major wars since the Six Day War in 1967 including the Yom Kippur and Lebanon wars. Bolstering Syria represented part of a broader Korean effort to push back against Western interests in the third world and was one of multiple KPA overseas operations conducted since the country had first gone to war with the United States in 1950. — location: [3021](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=3021) ^ref-43424

The fact that Azerbaijan had an overwhelming Shiite majority, but was nevertheless a close partner of Turkey, Israel and the West and saw Sunni jihadist militants fighting alongside its own forces, notably did much to undermine the narrative that conflict in the Middle East and Central Asia was predominantly sectarian based. — location: [8092](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09B18921H&location=8092) ^ref-39792

Turkey’s former Foreign Minister Yasar Yakis stated to this effect in early 2020: “Turkey initially did not intend to fight in Syria against Syrian soldiers but became too active in Idlib, where it defended armed Salafi jihadist groups.
