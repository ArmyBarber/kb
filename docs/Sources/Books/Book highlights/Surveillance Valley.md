Looking back on it now, with full knowledge of the history of the Internet, I can’t help but marvel at the transformation. It’s as weird as waking up and seeing hippies marching for the military draft. — location: [1610](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N809DBM&location=1610) ^ref-33723

The Internet is perhaps one of the most valuable public inventions of the twentieth century, and decisions made by a few key unelected officials in the federal bureaucracy set the Internet on the certain path to privatization. There was no real public debate, no discussion, no dissension, and no oversight. It was just given away, before anyone outside this bureaucratic bubble realized what was at stake. — location: [1892](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N809DBM&location=1892) ^ref-22811

The ARPANET was first used to spy on Americans in 1972, when it was employed to transfer surveillance files on antiwar protesters and civil rights leaders that the US Army had collected. — location: [3011](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N809DBM&location=3011) ^ref-40000

The bigger lesson of Snowden’s NSA cache was that almost nothing happened on the Internet without passing through some kind of US government — location: [4303](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N809DBM&location=4303) ^ref-58471

Not all surveillance is bad. Without them, there can be no democratic oversight of society. — location: [4423](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N809DBM&location=4423) ^ref-4990

surveillance and control are not problems in and of themselves. How they are used depends on our politics and political culture. — location: [4425](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N809DBM&location=4425) ^ref-38334

Murray advised the opposite: harsher prison terms and punitive zero-tolerance measures to deter crime as well as abolishing all government social programs, including food stamps, welfare, and the Social Security pension system (“Prison Called Best Treatment for Juvenile Offenders,” Associated Press, November 1, 1979, — location: [4626](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N809DBM&location=4626) ^ref-58232

much of the research tested in Vietnam, was ineffective at achieving its stated goal. Instead of decreasing joblessness and alleviating poverty, these reforms plunged minority communities into even more suffering and impoverishment — location: [4636](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N809DBM&location=4636) ^ref-63367
