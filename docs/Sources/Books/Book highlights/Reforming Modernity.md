## Highlights
current Islamic reformist discourse does not understand its own past, that it attempts to refashion it while being utterly ignorant of it. — location: [1169](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07PQXLX8L&location=1169) ^ref-21785

immediate interests (of the here and now, and I and We) remain both shortsighted and selfish on their own. Their completion and perfection reside in the embracing of distance, both spatial and temporal, human and nonhuman. The “other,” near or distant, stands in equidistant importance to knowledge, just as future time, whether eternally remote or mundanely approaching, does. Temporal distance, including any conception of transcendence, is no less important than any present, just as distant and unknown, even unknowable, nature is no less significant for our interests and existence than our immediate environment. — location: [1469](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07PQXLX8L&location=1469) ^ref-59434

to subjugate them as machines rather than employ them as humans; to subject them to unprecedented forms of slavery and to merciless conceptions of property; to develop these experiments into a system of coercion and discipline in a Foucauldian fashion; to turn all this around and further colonize the world with a view to enriching their coffers, reengineering the colonized as new subjects in the process; and finally to cultivate genocide as a weapon when other means failed— — location: [2283](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07PQXLX8L&location=2283) ^ref-62618

Rather, his project is political in the sense that no sphere of human life can be segregated from another, and that if all spheres are mere varieties within a single unity, then there is no distinction between politics and everything else. — location: [6227](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07PQXLX8L&location=6227) ^ref-11221

How Marxian!

---
A new concept of the human recognizes the world as a unity, where all things, sentient and insentient, stand in an interconnected whole. — location: [6412](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07PQXLX8L&location=6412) ^ref-29164

So much Marxist writing on this

---
Rather, it is an inner, formative conception of reality, a view from within, an outlook integral to, and internally embedded in, a conception of the world as one formed by interconnections and continuity. — location: [6413](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07PQXLX8L&location=6413) ^ref-50419

Dialectical materialism?
