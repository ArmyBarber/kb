as a rule, trying to get rid of your pain only amplifies it, entangles you further in it, and transforms it into something traumatic. — location: [376](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=376) ^ref-15830

some methods of avoiding pain are pathological in and of themselves. — location: [481](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=481) ^ref-16971

---
all of your problems provide you with two sources of pain. It is not just your anxiety or depression or worry that creates pain. Your pain is also holding you back from living the life you want to lead. — location: [566](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=566) ^ref-48743

---
Generally, the more you live your life trying to ward off the pain of presence, the more pain you get, particularly in the form of the pain of absence. — location: [577](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=577) ^ref-42908

---
of another kind of life: a life in which what you do is connected not to your pain, or to the avoidance of your pain, but to the kind of life you truly want to live. — location: [585](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=585) ^ref-7347

---
not about solving your problems in a traditional way so much as it is about changing the direction of your life, so that your life is more about what you value. — location: [587](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=587) ^ref-26287

---
We can be afraid of negative evaluations from others, even if we haven’t ever experienced them, and we can become socially inhibited as a result. — location: [745](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=745) ^ref-5994

---
problem: the verbal skills that create misery are too useful and central to human functioning to ever stop operating. That means suffering is an unavoidable part of the human condition, at least until we know how to better manage the skills language itself has given us. — location: [753](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=753) ^ref-31201

---
Thought suppression only makes the situation worse. — location: [765](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=765) ^ref-26611

---
When you try not to think of something, you do that by creating this verbal rule: “Don’t think of x.” That rule contains x, so it will tend to evoke x, — location: [781](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=781) ^ref-48430

---
may be that those with severe obsessive thinking problems spend more effort on trying not to think these thoughts — location: [787](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=787) ^ref-42707

---
it can be useless or even actively unhelpful to try to get rid of those thoughts you don’t like. — location: [809](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=809) ^ref-14323

---
emotions. If you try not to feel a bad feeling, such as pain, not only do you tend to feel it more intensely, but previously neutral events also become irritating — location: [813](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=813) ^ref-55891

---
when you suppress thoughts in the presence of an emotion, eventually the emotion evokes the thought, and the suppression strategies evoke both the thought and the emotion — location: [816](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=816) ^ref-53048

friend. In a sense you will have amplified your pain in your attempt to avoid feeling it. — location: [821](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=821) ^ref-55415

not to let it move at all, but especially not forward and back. The effect? It tends to move forward and back, not side to side, simply because thinking about not having it move forward and back activates the very muscles that move it that way — location: [826](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=826) ^ref-65044

it reminds you of bad consequences. — location: [868](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=868) ^ref-3599

bed). Of all the psychological processes known to science, experiential avoidance is one of the worst — location: [886](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=886) ^ref-54875

---
Experiential avoidance tends to artificially amplify the “pain of presence” discussed in chapter 1, and it is the single biggest source of the “pain of absence,” — location: [887](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=887) ^ref-8873

---
This is a dangerous trap because short-term effects are far more reinforcing than long-term effects, — location: [905](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=905) ^ref-24108

---
What you are left with are behaviors that have become deeply embedded in your day-to-day life due to their short-term effectiveness; but for long-term relief they are sadly lacking. — location: [910](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=910) ^ref-17028

---
2.4, we build out that core of pain by our patterns of cognitive entanglement and avoidance. — location: [914](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=914) ^ref-17704

---
Because running away also means that we are taking our fearful thoughts literally, they become more believable and entangling. — location: [918](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=918) ^ref-50202

You believe the thoughts that your mind presents to you. — location: [927](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=927) ^ref-38191

---
The rules and conditions our minds lay down for us are simple but powerful: act on the basis of belief and disbelief. They say that you must react to your mind either by agreeing with it or arguing with it. — location: [933](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=933) ^ref-22556

---
Unfortunately, both reactions are based on taking your thoughts literally. Rather than seeing your thoughts merely as an ongoing process of relating, they are reacted to based on what they relate to. They are “factually” correct or incorrect. — location: [935](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=935) ^ref-27521

---
If you have dark feelings and deliberately cover them up, whatever you do to compensate for feeling bad about yourself may begin to remind you that “Deep down there is something wrong with me.” — location: [994](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=994) ^ref-65390

Even positive feedback (although it feels good for a while) can have a hollow ring. — location: [999](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=999) ^ref-8912

---
You are likely to feel an immediate sense of relief from not having to deal with the painful thought, feeling, or bodily sensation. The sense of relief you gain reinforces your desire to use the same strategy the next time you are faced with the possibility of having to cope with your pain. — location: [1021](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=1021) ^ref-44490

---
each time you do this, you actually give the painful content, that is, your painful thought, feeling, or bodily sensation, more power. — location: [1023](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=1023) ^ref-27905

---
it’s not just that these avoidance strategies haven’t worked—it’s that they can’t work. Avoidance only strengthens the importance and the role of whatever you are avoiding—in other words, when you avoid dealing with your problem, it only grows. — location: [1036](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=1036) ^ref-41507

So, it’s not a question of getting free of the tube, it’s a question of how much “wiggle room” you want to have in your life. — location: [1046](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=1046) ^ref-33392

As an alternative, accepting response-ability means to acknowledge the possibility that you are able to respond. — location: [1070](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=1070) ^ref-28685

---
Who determines what you do with pain when it shows up? Being response-able means acknowledging that there is, in fact, some response you can make—you are able to respond. — location: [1079](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=1079) ^ref-4863

---
Only when you consider all the time and energy you’ve already spent fruitlessly trying to control your pain and avoid negative experiences, and then weighing the painful results, will you discover that the effort to do something radically different is worth it. — location: [1104](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=1104) ^ref-16263

---
Acceptance (which we will also refer to as willingness) is a skill you may have heard about or experimented with in the past. It is certainly something that you can learn to do. Unfortunately, it is not something your mind can do, — location: [1141](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=1141) ^ref-19159

---
your “willingness” here really means is you don’t want to feel anxiety, and you’ll try to jump through all kinds of mental hoops not to feel it. That’s not the same as being willing to feel your anxiety. — location: [1164](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=1164) ^ref-39600

---
“Accept” comes from the Latin root “capere” meaning “take.” Acceptance is the act of receiving or “taking what is offered.” Sometimes, in English, “accept” means “to tolerate or resign yourself” (as in, “Aw, gee, I guess I have to accept that”), and that is precisely not what is meant here. By “accept,” we mean something more like “taking completely, in the moment, without defense.” — location: [1170](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=1170) ^ref-42244

---
instead of trying to feel better, willingness involves learning how to feel better. — location: [1188](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=1188) ^ref-44576

ACT promotes better health management as a result of changes in your willingness to accept discomfort, unhook from your thoughts, and move toward what is most personally meaningful to you — location: [1220](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=1220) ^ref-9078

simple ACT acceptance metaphor, the Chinese finger trap (see chapter 3), reduced avoidance, anxiety symptoms, and anxious thoughts more successfully than did breathing retraining — location: [1231](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=1231) ^ref-13396

People who are more emotionally willing to experience negative emotional experiences enjoy better mental health and do better at work over time. — location: [1239](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=1239) ^ref-6231

when I try to close myself off from the painful parts of my past, I also close myself off from the helpful things I’ve learned from my past. — location: [1251](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=1251) ^ref-24452

It becomes very difficult to see that your pain does not define you, in part because it is very difficult to see that these are thoughts that your mind has produced. — location: [1467](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0054M063A&location=1467) ^ref-5774
