## Highlights
it is solely through the slow and steady building of personal relationships that one discovers the fundamental truth that all people everywhere have the same dreams and aspirations, that all people struggle with the same fears and anxieties. — location: [128](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=128) ^ref-45418

The only question that matters with regard to a religion and its mythology is “What do these stories mean?” — location: [262](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=262) ^ref-33334

first Council at Nicaea in 325 C.E.—which declared Jesus to be “fully God”—and the Council at Chalcedon in 451 C.E.—which entrenched the doctrine of the Trinity into Christian theology— — location: [508](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=508) ^ref-1357

indicate that the Quranic vision of the Last Days may have been revealed to the pagan Arabs through a set of symbols and metaphors with which they were already familiar, thanks in some part to the wide spread of Christianity in the region. — location: [534](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=534) ^ref-33219

Zoroastrianism, Christianity, and Judaism intermingled in one of the last remaining regions in the Near East still dominated by paganism, — location: [554](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=554) ^ref-42336

---
Not only does the Quran admit that God found Muhammad “erring” and gave him guidance (93:7), but the ancient traditions clearly show Muhammad deeply involved in the religious customs of Mecca: circumambulating the Ka‘ba, making sacrifices, and going on pagan devotional retreats called tahannuth. — location: [613](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=613) ^ref-64158

erroneous assumption that religions are born in some sort of cultural vacuum; they most certainly are not. — location: [619](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=619) ^ref-18722

---
Prophets are, above all, reformers who redefine and reinterpret the existing beliefs and practices of their communities, providing fresh sets of symbols and metaphors with which succeeding generations can describe the nature of reality. — location: [621](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=621) ^ref-24741

---
For better or worse, the closest our modern historical methods can come to determining the date of Muhammad’s birth is sometime in the last half of the sixth century C.E. — location: [647](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=647) ^ref-15895

---
There was no reason either to travel to Mecca or, for that matter, to settle there. No reason, that is, but the Ka‘ba. — location: [781](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=781) ^ref-43654

---
Especially for those with no formal protection—such as orphans and widows, neither of whom had access to any kind of inheritance—the only option was to borrow money from the rich at exorbitant interest rates, which inevitably led to debt, which in turn led to crushing poverty and, ultimately, to slavery. — location: [868](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=868) ^ref-33432

when he asked for the hand of his uncle’s daughter, Umm Hani, she rejected him outright for a more prosperous suitor. — location: [882](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=882) ^ref-55130

---
wealthy and respected female merchant in a society that treated women as chattel and prohibited them from inheriting the property of their husbands, Khadija had somehow managed to become one of the most respected members of Meccan society. — location: [884](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=884) ^ref-34245

---
On the other hand, he seemed to be acutely aware of his complicity in Mecca’s religio-economic system, which exploited the city’s unprotected masses in order to maintain the wealth and power of the élite. For fifteen years he struggled with the incongruity between his lifestyle and his beliefs; by his fortieth year, he was an intensely troubled man. — location: [898](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=898) ^ref-29359

---
As numerous scholars and Arab linguists have demonstrated, an-nabi al-ummi should more properly be understood as “the Prophet for the unlettered” — location: [930](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=930) ^ref-8412

---
a man only reaches the peak of his physical and intellectual powers when he becomes forty years old.” The Quran confirms this belief by equating manhood with the realization of the fortieth year of life (46:15). — location: [939](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=939) ^ref-65290

---
Aisha, who would become the Prophet’s closest and most beloved companion, claimed that the first signs of prophethood occurred long before the experience at Mt. Hira. These signs came in the form of visions that assailed Muhammad in his dreams, and which were so disturbing that they made him increasingly seek solitude. “He liked nothing better than to be alone,” Aisha recalled. — location: [947](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=947) ^ref-33362

---
What seems certain, however, is that Muhammad, like all the prophets before him, wanted nothing to do with God’s calling. — location: [960](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=960) ^ref-34220

---
when he needed assurance the most, God turned mute. — location: [990](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=990) ^ref-62368

---
Finally, when Muhammad was at his lowest, a second verse was sent down from heaven — location: [992](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=992) ^ref-34573

---
Noticeably absent in these early verses about the power and goodness of God is either an authoritative declaration of monotheism or a definitive critique of polytheism. — location: [1005](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=1005) ^ref-57419

---
what kind of god Allah was, not how many gods there were. — location: [1006](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=1006) ^ref-27728

---
the second theme informing the bulk of Muhammad’s earliest recitations—dealt almost exclusively with the demise of the tribal ethic in Mecca. — location: [1010](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=1010) ^ref-37675

---
Muhammad was not yet establishing a new religion; he was calling for sweeping social reform. He was not yet preaching monotheism; he was demanding economic justice. And for this revolutionary and profoundly innovative message, he was more or less ignored. — location: [1025](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=1025) ^ref-47811

---
during those early years is that its followers consisted primarily of what Montgomery Watt has called “the most influential families in the most influential clans.” — location: [1044](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=1044) ^ref-20579

---
young men, the majority under thirty years old, who felt the same discontent with Meccan society as Muhammad did. — location: [1045](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=1045) ^ref-53699

---
It is difficult to believe they would have been shocked by Muhammad’s monotheistic claims. — location: [1067](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=1067) ^ref-59465

---
this self-image that so greatly disturbed the Quraysh. — location: [1078](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=1078) ^ref-47187

---
not: the only way to bring about radical social and economic reform in Mecca was to overturn the religio-economic system on which the city was built; and the only way to do that was to attack the very source of the Quraysh’s wealth and prestige—the Ka‘ba. — location: [1084](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=1084) ^ref-55403

---
This statement was a conscious and deliberate attack on both the Ka‘ba and the sacred right of the Quraysh to manage — location: [1087](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=1087) ^ref-19262

---
the God of the heavens and the earth required no intermediaries whatsoever, but could be accessed by anyone. Thus, the idols in the sanctuary, and indeed the sanctuary itself, insofar as it served as a repository for the gods, were utterly useless. And if the Ka‘ba was useless, then there was no more reason for Mecca’s supremacy as either the religious or the economic center of Arabia. — location: [1090](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=1090) ^ref-32761

---
they were absolutely earnest in their conviction that Muhammad was dividing the families of Mecca. — location: [1107](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=1107) ^ref-10193

---
the Quraysh seemed more disturbed with Muhammad’s insistent derision of the rituals and traditional values of their forefathers, traditions upon which the social, religious, and economic foundation of the city rested, than they were by his message of monotheism. — location: [1114](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=1114) ^ref-31701

---
It is a wonder—some would say a miracle—that this same man, who had been forced to sneak out of his home under cover of night to join the seventy or so followers anxiously awaiting him in a foreign land hundreds of miles away, would, in a few short years, return to the city of his birth, not covertly or in darkness, but in the full light of day, with ten thousand men trailing peacefully behind him; and the same people who once tried to murder him in his sleep would instead offer up to him both the sacred city and the keys to the Ka‘ba—unconditionally and without a fight, like a consecrated sacrifice. — location: [1163](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=1163) ^ref-51207

The document—often celebrated as the world’s first written constitution — location: [1260](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=1260) ^ref-57838

---
one can refer to Muhammad’s community in Yathrib as the Ummah, but only insofar as that term is understood to designate what the Orientalist explorer Bertram Thomas has called a “super-tribe,” or what the historian Marshall Hodgson more accurately describes as a “neo-tribe”: that is, a radically new kind of social organization, but one that was nonetheless based on the traditional Arab tribal paradigm. — location: [1318](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=1318) ^ref-9210

“not in turning your face East or West in prayer … but in distributing your wealth out of love for God to your needy kin; to the orphans, to the vagrants, and to the mendicants; it lies in freeing the slaves, in observing your devotions, and in giving alms to the poor” — location: [1345](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=1345) ^ref-46944

---
his betrothal to Aisha was just that: a betrothal. — location: [1423](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=1423) ^ref-5460

---
The most shocking aspect of Muhammad’s marriages is not his ten years of polygamy in Yathrib, but his twenty-five years of monogamy in Mecca, — location: [1424](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=1424) ^ref-4797

---
for fourteen centuries, the science of Quranic commentary has been the exclusive domain of Muslim men. — location: [1506](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=1506) ^ref-10006

---
He instituted segregated prayers — location: [1535](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=1535) ^ref-26535

---
the religious message of the Quran—a message of revolutionary social egalitarianism—must be separated from the cultural prejudices of seventh-century Arabia. — location: [1544](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=1544) ^ref-36659

---
the traditional image of the veiled Muslim woman as the sheltered and docile sexual property of her husband is just as misleading and simpleminded as the postmodernist image of the veil as the emblem of female freedom and empowerment from Western cultural hegemony. — location: [1585](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=1585) ^ref-11723

women prayed and fought alongside men; — location: [1596](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=1596) ^ref-45130

the more his men urge him to go out and meet the enemy, the more he wavers. — location: [1629](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=1629) ^ref-19844

---
Throughout every one of these regions, but especially in the Near East, where religion explicitly sanctioned the state, territorial expansion was identical to religious proselytization. Thus, every religion was a “religion of the sword.” — location: [1694](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=1694) ^ref-19100

War, according to the Quran, is either just or unjust; it is never “holy.” — location: [1708](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=1708) ^ref-55548

jihad should best be understood as a primitive “just war theory”: — location: [1709](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=1709) ^ref-13206

The raiding party would quickly descend on a caravan—usually at its rear—and carry off whatever they could get their hands on before being discovered. — location: [1733](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=1733) ^ref-62508

---
At the heart of the doctrine of jihad was the heretofore unrecognized distinction between combatant and noncombatant. — location: [1759](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=1759) ^ref-52501

---
Ibn Taymiyya argued that the idea of killing nonbelievers who refused to convert to Islam—the foundation of the classical doctrine of jihad—not only defied the example of Muhammad but also violated one of the most important principles in the Quran: that “there can be no compulsion in religion” (2:256). — location: [1780](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=1780) ^ref-39094

---
What has for centuries been defined as a collective duty that can be waged solely in defense of life, faith, and property has, in Jihadism, been transformed into a radically individualistic obligation, totally divorced from any institutional power. — location: [1808](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=1808) ^ref-50113

---
if there was no one to stand up to despots and tyrants, then, as the Quran states, our “monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques—places where the name of God is honored—would all be razed to the ground” — location: [1820](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=1820) ^ref-37279

The Banu Nadir left Medina for Khaybar, taking their wealth and property with them. — location: [1879](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=1879) ^ref-36752

Only under the leadership of Umar near the end of the seventh century C.E. were the remaining Jewish clans in Medina expelled— — location: [1934](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=1934) ^ref-26833

(Pagans and polytheists, however, were often given a choice between conversion and death.) — location: [1943](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=1943) ^ref-48906

---
Umar ordered the demolition of a mosque in Damascus that had been illegally constructed by forcibly expropriating the house of a Jew, he was merely following the Prophet’s warning that “he who wrongs a Jew or a Christian will have me as his accuser on the Day of Judgment.” — location: [1945](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=1945) ^ref-7233

Jewish documents written during this period refer to Islam as “an act of God’s mercy.” — location: [1952](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=1952) ^ref-31937

---
This may explain why Christianity gradually disappeared in most of the Islamic lands, while Jewish communities increased and prospered. — location: [1956](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=1956) ^ref-1312

---
the Jewish clans of Medina were in no way a religiously observant group; they may not even have been Jews, if Margoliouth and others are correct. — location: [1996](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=1996) ^ref-49726

He purposely set the day of Muslim congregation at noon on Friday so that it would coincide with, but not disrupt, Jewish preparations for the Sabbath. — location: [2049](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=2049) ^ref-24058

Despite the changes, Muhammad continued to encourage his followers to fast on Yom Kippur, and he never ceased to venerate Jerusalem as a holy city; — location: [2054](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=2054) ^ref-22067

---
until the day he died, Muhammad continued to engage in peaceful discourse—not theological debate—with the Jewish communities of Arabia, just as the Quran had commanded him to do: “Do not argue with the People of the Book—apart from those individuals who act unjustly toward you—unless it is in a fair way — location: [2057](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=2057) ^ref-1395

throughout the first two centuries of Islam, Muslims regularly read the Torah alongside the Quran. — location: [2060](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=2060) ^ref-16402

---
this verse, and the many others like it in the Quran, is in no way a condemnation of Christianity per se but of Imperial Byzantine (Trinitarian) Orthodoxy, — location: [2069](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=2069) ^ref-50133

---
just as they reversed many of Muhammad’s social reforms aimed at empowering women, the Muslim scriptural and legal scholars of the following centuries rejected the notion that Jews and Christians were part of the Ummah, and instead designated both groups as unbelievers. — location: [2099](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=2099) ^ref-63399

Only six men and four women were put to death for various crimes, and no one was forced to convert to Islam, — location: [2147](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=2147) ^ref-5695

She never spoke to Abu Bakr again, and when she died a short time later, Ali quietly buried her at night without bothering to inform the Caliph. — location: [2384](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=2384) ^ref-60204

over the past fourteen centuries, Islam as we know it has been almost exclusively defined by an extremely small, rigid, and often profoundly traditionalist group of men who, for better or worse, consider themselves to be the unyielding pillars upon which the religious, social, and political foundations of the religion rest. — location: [2722](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=2722) ^ref-32232

al-Mutawakkil swung the theological pendulum to the side of the Traditionalists by richly rewarding their Ulama and persecuting the very same Rationalists who had up until his reign enjoyed the favors of the court. By the reign of the Caliph al-Qadir (d. 1031), the vast majority of the Traditionalist Ulama, especially the influential Hanbalites, were united under a single doctrine. — location: [2787](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=2787) ^ref-19756

shirk can also be defined as placing obstacles in the way of God, whether greed, or drink, or pride, or false piety, or any other grave sin that keeps the believer apart from God. — location: [2926](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004SOQ0U8&location=2926) ^ref-49398
