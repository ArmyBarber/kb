## Highlights
As we navigate our lives, we normally allow ourselves to be guided by impressions and feelings, and the confidence we have in our intuitive beliefs and preferences is usually justified. But not always. We are often confident even when we are wrong, and an objective observer is more likely to detect our errors than we are. — location: [44](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=44) ^ref-46277

---
we had not developed an intuitive sense of the reliability of statistical results observed in small samples. — location: [62](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=62) ^ref-12209

---
The pleasure we found in working together made us exceptionally patient; it is much easier to strive for perfection when you are never bored. — location: [71](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=71) ^ref-13966

---
A recurrent theme of this book is that luck plays a large role in every story of success; it is almost always easy to identify a small change in the story that would have turned a remarkable achievement into a mediocre outcome. Our story was no exception. — location: [145](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=145) ^ref-31953

“The situation has provided a cue; this cue has given the expert access to information stored in memory, and the information provides the answer. Intuition is nothing more and nothing less than recognition.” — location: [183](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=183) ^ref-5748

---
emotion now looms much larger in our understanding of intuitive judgments and choices than it did in the past. — location: [196](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=196) ^ref-36093

---
affect heuristic, where judgments and decisions are guided directly by feelings of liking and disliking, with little deliberation or reasoning. — location: [198](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=198) ^ref-32909

when faced with a difficult question, we often answer an easier one instead, usually without noticing the substitution. — location: [205](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=205) ^ref-53948

A goal is to introduce a language for thinking and talking about the mind. — location: [219](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=219) ^ref-1249

a puzzling limitation of our mind: our excessive confidence in what we believe we know, and our apparent inability to acknowledge the full extent of our ignorance and the uncertainty of the world we live in. — location: [223](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=223) ^ref-3466

what makes the experiencing self happy is not quite the same as what satisfies the remembering self. — location: [238](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=238) ^ref-39213

we can be blind to the obvious, and we are also blind to our blindness. — location: [334](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=334) ^ref-43318

---
many people are overconfident, prone to place too much faith in their intuitions. They apparently find cognitive effort at least mildly unpleasant and avoid it as much as possible. — location: [691](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=691) ^ref-10249

cognition is embodied; you think with your body, not only with your brain. — location: [808](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=808) ^ref-5229

the influencing of an action by the idea—is known as the ideomotor effect. — location: [851](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=851) ^ref-39105

---
“act calm and kind regardless of how you feel” is very good advice: you are likely to be rewarded by actually feeling calm and kind. — location: [871](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=871) ^ref-8421

---
Money-primed people become more independent than they would be without the associative trigger. They persevered almost twice as long in trying to solve a very difficult problem before they asked the experimenter for help, a crisp demonstration of increased self-reliance. — location: [885](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=885) ^ref-30372

---
the idea of money primes individualism: a reluctance to be involved with others, to depend on others, or to accept demands from others. — location: [892](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=892) ^ref-6539

---
Feeling that one’s soul is stained appears to trigger a desire to cleanse one’s body, an impulse that has been dubbed the “Lady Macbeth effect.” — location: [903](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=903) ^ref-25334

---
your subjective experience consists largely of the story that your System 2 tells itself about what is going on. Priming phenomena arise in System 1, and you have no conscious access to them. — location: [916](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=916) ^ref-8112

“They were primed to find flaws, and this is exactly what they found.” — location: [940](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=940) ^ref-62157

---
Hearing a speaker when you are in a good mood, or even when you have a pencil stuck crosswise in your mouth to make you “smile,” also induces cognitive ease. — location: [956](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=956) ^ref-21333

---
The impression of familiarity is produced by System 1, and System 2 relies on that impression for a true/false judgment. — location: [999](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=999) ^ref-10280

---
A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth. — location: [1002](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=1002) ^ref-46542

---
anything you can do to reduce cognitive strain will help, so you should first maximize legibility. — location: [1011](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=1011) ^ref-64191

couching familiar ideas in pretentious language is taken as a sign of poor intelligence and low credibility. — location: [1020](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=1020) ^ref-50756

---
System 2 is lazy and that mental effort is aversive. — location: [1032](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=1032) ^ref-50175

---
On most occasions, however, the lazy System 2 will adopt the suggestions of System 1 and march on. — location: [1042](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=1042) ^ref-43669

---
Cognitive strain, whatever its source, mobilizes System 2, which is more likely to reject the intuitive answer suggested by System 1. — location: [1060](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=1060) ^ref-33890

---
It appears to be a feature of System 1 that cognitive ease is associated with good feelings. — location: [1066](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=1066) ^ref-59519

---
putting the participants in a good mood before the test by having them think happy thoughts more than doubled accuracy. — location: [1120](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=1120) ^ref-46944

---
Mood evidently affects the operation of System 1: when we are uncomfortable and unhappy, we lose touch with our intuition. — location: [1122](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=1122) ^ref-55123

---
Cognitive ease is both a cause and a consequence of a pleasant feeling. — location: [1128](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=1128) ^ref-58813

---
an emotional response to the cognitive ease of a triad of words mediates impressions of coherence. — location: [1145](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=1145) ^ref-29337

“I’m in a very good mood today, and my System 2 is weaker than usual. I should be extra careful.” — location: [1151](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=1151) ^ref-9017

but a statement that can explain two contradictory outcomes explains nothing at all. — location: [1232](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=1232) ^ref-40153

We are evidently ready from birth to have impressions of causality, which do not depend on reasoning about patterns of causation. — location: [1253](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=1253) ^ref-20525

System 1 does not keep track of alternatives that it rejects, or even of the fact that there were alternatives. — location: [1313](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=1313) ^ref-26532

---
when System 2 is otherwise engaged, we will believe almost anything. — location: [1328](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=1328) ^ref-2847

---
System 1 is gullible and biased to believe, System 2 is in charge of doubting and unbelieving, but System 2 is sometimes busy, and often lazy. — location: [1329](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=1329) ^ref-6902

Ben. The initial traits in the list change the very meaning of the traits that appear later.

first. I had told the students that the two essays had equal weight, but that was not true: the first one had a much greater impact on the final grade than the second. — location: [1370](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=1370) ^ref-19988

---
The uncomfortable inconsistency that was revealed when I switched to the new procedure was real: it reflected both the inadequacy of any single question as a measure of what the student knew and the unreliability of my own grading. — location: [1383](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=1383) ^ref-61909

If the observers share a bias, the aggregation of judgments will not reduce it. Allowing the observers to influence each other effectively reduces the size of the sample, and with it the precision of the group estimate. — location: [1391](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=1391) ^ref-62884

To derive the most useful information from multiple sources of evidence, you should always try to make these sources independent of each other. — location: [1393](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=1393) ^ref-33723

And there also remains a bias favoring the first impression. — location: [1419](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=1419) ^ref-37211

The combination of a coherence-seeking System 1 with a lazy System 2 implies that System 2 will endorse many intuitive beliefs, which closely reflect the impressions generated by System 1. — location: [1419](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=1419) ^ref-3445

Furthermore, participants who saw one-sided evidence were more confident of their judgments than those who saw both sides. — location: [1441](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=1441) ^ref-5838

In about 70% of the races for senator, congressman, and governor, the election winner was the candidate whose face had earned a higher rating of competence. — location: [1498](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=1498) ^ref-55082

that if you think the other side has made an outrageous proposal, you should not come back with an equally outrageous counteroffer, creating a gap that will be difficult to bridge in further negotiations.
