Our lives are made uneasy now because the Russian Revolution of 1917 resulted in the creation of a rival system to our own. This revolution was the most sweeping in all modern history. — location: [651](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08P1R4Z1Y&location=651) ^ref-34990

after a tremendous propaganda drive, the capital was taken over by well organized and directed action on November 5–7, 1917. Resistance melted away before overwhelming odds and only half a dozen lives were lost. — location: [975](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08P1R4Z1Y&location=975) ^ref-33595

After the Armistice, Bolshevism was the great fear which haunted the controlling elements in the democracies. War upon it seemed urgent, with the great hope of crushing it in its lair before it spread further. Of all these motives there can hardly be any doubt that the last one became the dominant purpose of the British and French Governments. — location: [1365](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08P1R4Z1Y&location=1365) ^ref-26604

The costs, however, were staggering. When it was all over Russia was devastated throughout her vast expanses, from Poland to the Pacific and from the Arctic to the Caucasus. Millions of poor civilians had died of abuse, hunger and famine, which was soon to claim millions more.

Between November 1918 and February 1919 the Soviet Government addressed seven peace proposals, “couched in the most conciliatory language,” to the Entente Powers and to the United States. — location: [1432](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08P1R4Z1Y&location=1432) ^ref-7346

“There was never any doubt in my mind that Russia would aid us by all the ways open to her, but I did not dare to fight with Russian aid alone, because I knew that the British and French Governments would make out of my country another Spain.” — location: [2957](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08P1R4Z1Y&location=2957) ^ref-11137

when Hitler torpedoed his Munich vows and invaded the rump of Czechoslovakia in March 1938, “every newspaper correspondent, every business house, every embassy and legation in Europe” knew that he was going East. — location: [2990](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08P1R4Z1Y&location=2990) ^ref-3480

From the Anglo-German Naval Treaty of 1935 on, Russia had had ample evidence that London and Paris meant to turn Hitler in their direction. — location: [2995](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08P1R4Z1Y&location=2995) ^ref-24853

---
the British Government suddenly remembered the existence of the Soviet Union and inquired what its attitude would be toward the Hitler threat in Eastern Europe. Moscow replied promptly and proposed an immediate conference between Britain, France, the U.S.S.R., Poland, Rumania and Turkey to consider how to resist German aggression. This was exactly and obviously what was urgently needed. — location: [3028](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08P1R4Z1Y&location=3028) ^ref-53535

they ascribed to Russia the very same design of which they were guilty, as devious men so often do. They had a “deep seated conviction,” shared also by the French Rightists, that Russia wished to destroy the capitalist system in Europe by provoking a war from which she would remain aloof. — location: [3033](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08P1R4Z1Y&location=3033) ^ref-29570

Poland’s comfortable blocking of any liaison with Russia revealed the impossibility of stopping Hitler, at this late date, without a gigantic world war. — location: [3051](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08P1R4Z1Y&location=3051) ^ref-3979

Poland might survive by close alliance with one of her great neighbors. Being unable to choose between her hatreds doomed her to sure destruction and in all probability to another partition. — location: [3061](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08P1R4Z1Y&location=3061) ^ref-27056

Rumania. Poland had been on the hot spot since January 5, 1939, when Hitler had summoned Colonel Beck to Berlin to discuss an alliance against Soviet Russia. Beck temporized and incurred Hitler’s wrath. — location: [3068](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08P1R4Z1Y&location=3068) ^ref-21975

it suddenly became apparent to the Munich men that the pursuit of their policy would enable Hitler to absorb the resources of all Central and Eastern Europe, not for use against Russia but against themselves, and without a fight. — location: [3073](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08P1R4Z1Y&location=3073) ^ref-23259

This lightning change of front was not, of course, motivated by any sudden love for Polish liberty. It was bom of an abruptly acquired desire to have somebody absorb some of Hitler’s lethal fury. — location: [3082](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08P1R4Z1Y&location=3082) ^ref-14433

Poland was a pale substitute in fighting power for the powerful Czechoslovak fortress which had been so resolutely and callously thrown away, but any sort of ally was now better than none. — location: [3083](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08P1R4Z1Y&location=3083) ^ref-11601

Britain had no power whatever to save Rumania or Poland from German assault. Only the Soviet Union could do that, and serious consideration of an alliance with the much feared Soviets was not begun until April 15, after the Rumanian and Polish guarantees had been tossed out. — location: [3090](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08P1R4Z1Y&location=3090) ^ref-42010

the British Government asked Russia to give a unilateral guarantee to Poland and Rumania. — location: [3093](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08P1R4Z1Y&location=3093) ^ref-57702

Russia promptly proposed, on April 17, a binding pact of mutual assistance between Britain, France and Russia, to be implemented by a military agreement, which would guarantee all of the border states from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. — location: [3095](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08P1R4Z1Y&location=3095) ^ref-29089

London replied to Russia on May 9, 1939, repeating its proposal that Russia give a unilateral guarantee to Poland and Rumania and adding the astounding proviso that the guarantee should go into effect only on the decision of the British Government. — location: [3101](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08P1R4Z1Y&location=3101) ^ref-5919

Russia was invited to receive the full impact of Hitler’s giant war machine without the slightest suggestion of any willingness to aid in her defense and she was invited to move against Hitler on orders from London. — location: [3106](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08P1R4Z1Y&location=3106) ^ref-35758

Thus Poland was to be defended against Germany by the ego of the Polish colonels and by the British Navy in the Atlantic, not by the powerful Red Army fighting with the Polish forces. — location: [3123](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08P1R4Z1Y&location=3123) ^ref-37108

A Gallup poll showed that 92 per cent of the British people favored an alliance with Russia.

“He wanted it at all costs.” Gafencu was “struck by the clearness of his decision,” and sure that it had the full approval of the other French leaders.

May 19 Lloyd George, Eden and Churchill again pressed upon the Government the life-and-death nature of the need for an immediate arrangement with Russia of the most far-reaching terms. Churchill begged the Government “to get some of these brutal truths into their heads.

and instead they sent William Strang, a lesser official, from the Foreign Office. This was a triple insult to the Soviet Union because Strang was of low diplomatic rank, he had defended a group of British engineers in an espionage case in Soviet Russia, and he had been a member of Chamberlain’s entourage at Munich. — location: [3154](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08P1R4Z1Y&location=3154) ^ref-28331

There was one way, and only one, by which Germany could be deterred from taking the fatal plunge. TTiat was the signature of an air-tight alliance between the Western Powers and Russia, with no loopholes in it, but on July 30 his biographer records that Chamberlain regarded a breakdown of the Anglo-Russian negotiations “with equanimity, as highly probable.” — location: [3219](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08P1R4Z1Y&location=3219) ^ref-26367

The Allied chiefs knew well that their failure to make an alliance with Russia would mean the destruction of Poland.

into a formal Treaty of Mutual Assistance between Britain and Poland and signed in London on August 25. Never were names put to a more hollow instrument.

The decision to obliterate Poland was therefore fixed before the pact with Russia was signed.

the Soviet Government did not have this choice. By standing aloof it would have lost not only Eastern Poland but the Baltic states as well. By rejecting Hitler’s promises, and the threats that always went with them, the Soviets would have placed themselves in the daily and imminent danger of fighting the German-Russian war which they believed the West had tried to bring about. — location: [3320](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08P1R4Z1Y&location=3320) ^ref-47763

By making the truce with Hitler the Soviets gained four things. (1) They got everything in the Baltic states which the Allies had refused them, and more, plus the ability to ship home to Germany 100,000 Baltic Germans, as well as 300,000 other Germans from Poland and other Eastern areas. These huge fifth columns were quickly cleaned out of the Russian sphere, to the deep chagrin of the Nazi supermen. (2) They achieved freedom to correct their boundary with Finland and reclaim Bessarabia from Rumania. (3) Instead of incurring the full power of the Nazi war machine, while the West viewed their plight with satisfaction, they turned Hitler back upon the West. (4) They also acquired nearly two years of precious time in which to prepare for a German onslaught. — location: [3323](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08P1R4Z1Y&location=3323) ^ref-502

At each step union against the aggressor was a crying need, and in each case the Soviet Union gave ample evidence of its willingness to unite, but in every instance its cooperation was rejected. — location: [3334](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08P1R4Z1Y&location=3334) ^ref-55347

Nothing was too good for the Finns.

Britain and France had 50,000 troops ready to sail.
