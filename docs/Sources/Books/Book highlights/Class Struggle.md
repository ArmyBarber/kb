## Highlights
Does Nazi Germany’s attempt to reduce Slavs to the condition of black slaves in the service of the master race, and the epic resistance to this war of colonial subjugation and actual enslavement—the ‘great racial war’ undertaken by the Third Reich—mounted by entire peoples, have nothing to do with class struggle? — location: [183](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWT8WL4&location=183) ^ref-17844

that the struggle for a ‘foreign policy’ supportive of oppressed nations was an integral part of ‘the general struggle for the emancipation of the working classes’. — location: [360](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWT8WL4&location=360) ^ref-12561

---
Far from being of minor relevance from the standpoint of class struggle, the exploitation and oppression that obtain internationally are a precondition, at least methodologically, for understanding social conflict and class struggle at a national level. — location: [372](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWT8WL4&location=372) ^ref-26173

The sections and members of the exploiting class and oppressor nation most inclined to theoretical study and moral reflection are invited not to lose sight of the grave practical drawbacks and general human devastation created by the social system, of which they are nevertheless beneficiaries in immediate material terms. — location: [1573](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWT8WL4&location=1573) ^ref-61375

that the ‘outward appearance’ or ‘delusive appearance’ of a phenomenon does not coincide with its ‘essence’; and hence, a prolonged, laborious intellectual engagement was required to achieve ‘science’, ‘scientific truth’. — location: [1585](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWT8WL4&location=1585) ^ref-11155

---
Reason can certainly be employed to justify privilege, domination and oppression. Yet, as Nietzsche recognizes, inherent in it is the tendency to assert relations of equality, and hence, to delegitimize privilege, domination, and oppression. Emancipatory class struggle and reason have a tendency to converge. — location: [1627](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWT8WL4&location=1627) ^ref-8800

everything is prey to conflict, but not in the same way and, in any event, not in a way that is immutable over time. — location: [1642](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWT8WL4&location=1642) ^ref-36994

the ethos of the community of the concept and reason goes hand in hand with the ethos of human community, which is the inspiration for emancipatory class struggle. — location: [1651](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWT8WL4&location=1651) ^ref-8566

the history of the West as a whole can be interpreted in the light of the principle that a people which oppresses another people is not free. — location: [2245](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWT8WL4&location=2245) ^ref-32671

the totalitarian domination and genocidal practices running from top to bottom of the colonial tradition erupted in the very continent where this historical sequence started, in the wake of Hitler’s attempt to build a continental empire in Eastern Europe, subjugating, decimating and enslaving the ‘natives’ who inhabited it. — location: [2246](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWT8WL4&location=2246) ^ref-55014

---
The binary interpretation of social conflict, which perceives only one contradiction (opposing rich and poor), does not make it possible to understand emancipatory movements, whose social basis is not formed exclusively of poor people. — location: [2398](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWT8WL4&location=2398) ^ref-28994

Marx was not wrong to reprove him for pursuing an ‘alliance with absolutist and feudal opponents against the bourgeoisie’, 6 flirting with someone who later promulgated ruthless anti-socialist (and anti-working class) laws. — location: [2403](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWT8WL4&location=2403) ^ref-32741

the attempt to extract gracious concessions from the existing government in the direction of a welfare state—went hand in hand with neglect of other fronts in the class struggle and a narrowly economistic view of working-class struggle itself. — location: [2406](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWT8WL4&location=2406) ^ref-1292

a populist current which (Engels observed) liked ‘to describe the Russian peasants as the true vehicles of socialism, as born communists, in contrast to the workers of the aging, decayed European West, who would first have to go through the ordeal of acquiring socialism artificially’. — location: [2422](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWT8WL4&location=2422) ^ref-48860

---
The underestimation of the task of abolishing an ancien régime notable for its oppression of nations and women, as well as the working class, was patent. Once again, the class struggle is heavily mutilated and, even when it comes to engagement on behalf of the subaltern classes, what remains is trifling. — location: [2425](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWT8WL4&location=2425) ^ref-65528

---
in the very years when Marx and Engels were expressing their hopes in the proletariat as the agency of universal emancipation with youthful hyperbole, followers of Fourier (and Saint-Simon) planned to construct communities of a more or less socialist kind in Algeria, on land taken from the Arabs in a brutal, sometimes genocidal war. — location: [2434](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWT8WL4&location=2434) ^ref-36805

For the two representatives of socialism cited here, commitment to the abolition of slavery in the colonies or the North American republic distracted attention from the social question, which remained a burning issue in the capitalist metropolis. — location: [2446](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWT8WL4&location=2446) ^ref-18322

the inventor of a ‘socialism’ more appropriately defined as ‘imperial’ than ‘feudal’. Far from meeting with derision from the popular classes, this was socialism that often enchanted and ensnared them. — location: [2460](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWT8WL4&location=2460) ^ref-12192

the English aristocracy had shelved the caste, even racial arrogance it traditionally displayed towards the popular classes; and now it was the ‘fraternal’ national English community as a whole that adopted a pose of supreme aristocratic disdain for other nations, especially colonial populations. — location: [2468](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWT8WL4&location=2468) ^ref-25065

What is intimated here is a scenario of well-nigh global revolution, whose protagonist would be black slaves in the USA, serfs in Russia, and wage slaves or workers in Britain. — location: [2545](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWT8WL4&location=2545) ^ref-15516

the expectation of a general revolt from below by black slaves, serfs and wage slaves clouded the capacity for historical prediction. — location: [2565](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWT8WL4&location=2565) ^ref-30324

---
as opposed to a general insurrection of the poor against the rich, revolution is anticipated from a conjunction of international war and internal social conflict. We are reminded of October 1917. — location: [2572](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWT8WL4&location=2572) ^ref-30885

The ‘obviousness’ of exploitation and, with it, the unity of the exploited class disappears so that a binary interpretation of social conflict becomes unsustainable. — location: [2601](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWT8WL4&location=2601) ^ref-56173

workers, even those in large-scale industry, constitute ‘a crowd of people unknown to one another’ and ‘an incoherent mass … broken up by their mutual competition’. — location: [2613](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWT8WL4&location=2613) ^ref-10795

the category of lumpen-proletariat refers to a mutable political function rather than a clearly defined social condition. — location: [2621](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWT8WL4&location=2621) ^ref-25759

Depending on the case, it can place itself at the service of the dominant bloc or, more rarely, let itself be drawn into the revolutionary movement. — location: [2622](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWT8WL4&location=2622) ^ref-31228

---
ideological and political maturity and the politics of alliances have taken the place of the decisive role of direct sensory self-evidence and the binary reading of social conflict and the revolutionary process. — location: [2629](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWT8WL4&location=2629) ^ref-48832

So political maturity allowing for alliances is on key thing, but shitty alliances (like feudalists against booj) are also decried. It has to be done intelligently

What emerged in some sections of the communist movement was an unrealistic internationalism that tended to liquidate different national identities as mere prejudices. — location: [5152](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWT8WL4&location=5152) ^ref-53823

Just as it does not betoken the end of the state, so socialism does not entail either the disappearance of the market, or the fusion of the countries engaged in constructing a new social order into a community free of tensions and conflicts. — location: [5400](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWT8WL4&location=5400) ^ref-34180

The basic problem was that the Chinese were not treated as equals and felt humiliated. However, we have never forgotten that in the period of our First Five-Year Plan the Soviet Union helped us lay an industrial foundation’. — location: [5407](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWT8WL4&location=5407) ^ref-38010

When we remember that religion can be a key moment in the construction of national identity, this is another reason for casting doubt on the thesis of the inevitable disappearance of religion after the victory of proletarian class struggle. — location: [5414](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWT8WL4&location=5414) ^ref-2689

Mao, the protagonist of an epic national liberation struggle that defeated the plans for colonization and enslavement pursued by the Third Reich’s Asian imitators, is put on a par with Hitler! This operation aims to undermine the self-respect of members of the Communist Party and citizens of the People’s Republic, in the context of a crusade seeking to wield the power of wealth over Beijing, in order to suppress what is regarded as an intolerable anomaly. — location: [6638](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWT8WL4&location=6638) ^ref-61971

Workers struggling for higher wages and better living and working conditions, who have achieved (and are achieving) significant results, often clash with it. But such struggles are not aimed at overthrowing or challenging the government, and in fact often call on its support to face down the arrogance and resistance of particular local employers or bosses. — location: [6647](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWT8WL4&location=6647) ^ref-7153

within the Communist Party of China there seems to be a clash between a purely national current, which regards the revolutionary process as concluded with the achievement of national objectives (modernization, restoration of territorial integrity, and the renaissance of China), and a current with much more ambitious objectives pertaining to the history and ideals of the communist movement. — location: [6677](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWT8WL4&location=6677) ^ref-47875

With its development, which continues to be largely directed by the political power, and even now seeks to subordinate the hunt for profit by private sectors of the economy to general ends, China is the country that more than any other is challenging the international division of labour imposed by colonialism and imperialism, and furthering the end of the Columbian epoch—a fact of enormous, progressive historical significance. — location: [6680](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWT8WL4&location=6680) ^ref-39929

The struggle of those who obey against those who command, when the type of domination involves the destruction of human dignity by the latter, is the most legitimate, the most justified, the most authentic thing in the world.

The masses in this country … are slave stock. They are good for nothing but slaves and only when they are used as slaves are they happy. …When the war is over, we should destroy the sewers. The perfect birth control for Spain is the birth control God intended us to have.

To speak of class struggle, Weil seeks the weak—‘those who do not command’—and does not notice the overwhelming mass of slaves or potential slaves on the horizon. — location: [6927](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWT8WL4&location=6927) ^ref-63419

As for Soviet Russia, it risked being reduced to a colony: ‘[t]o defend itself, it must constantly expand its productive apparatus and armaments, and this at the cost of complete enslavement of the labouring masses’. — location: [6938](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWT8WL4&location=6938) ^ref-59941

as a result of the unity between humanity and nature and the decisive role of consciousness in the development of the productive forces, the squandering and prodigality of human lives is, at the same time, a squandering and prodigality of material wealth. — location: [7005](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LWT8WL4&location=7005) ^ref-56695

Capitalist destruction of the productive forces and capitalist destruction of human resources are intimately related—in fact, go hand in hand.
