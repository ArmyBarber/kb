## Highlights
What lured Europeans to leave their homes and cross the Atlantic was the chance to share in conquering Indian land. At that time there was a crisis in England over land ownership and tenancy due to the rise of capitalism. — location: [185](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00N980EQK&location=185) ^ref-25586

---
The coming of capitalism had smashed all the traditional securities and values of feudal England, and financed its beginnings with the most savage reduction of the general living standard. — location: [198](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00N980EQK&location=198) ^ref-20435

---
the ultimate economic objective of colonial workmen was security through agriculture rather than industry … As soon as a workman had accumulated a small amount of money he could, and in many cases did, take up a tract of land and settle on it as a farmer.” — location: [219](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00N980EQK&location=219) ^ref-36025

this lie is precisely the same lie put forward by the white “Afrikaner” settlers, who claim that South Africa was literally totally uninhabited by any Afrikans when they arrived from Europe. To universal derision, these European settlers claim to be the only rightful, historic inhabitants of South Afrika. Or we can hear similar defenses put forward by the European settlers of Israel, who claim that much of the Palestinian land and buildings they occupy are rightfully theirs, since the Arabs allegedly decided to voluntarily abandon it all during the 1948–49 war. — location: [249](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00N980EQK&location=249) ^ref-9021

It was the unpaid, expropriated labor of millions of Indian and Afrikan captive slaves that created the surpluses on which the settler economy floated and Atlantic trade flourished. — location: [331](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00N980EQK&location=331) ^ref-5552

While the cream of the profits went to the planter and merchant capitalists, the entire settler economy was raised up on a foundation of slave labor, slave products, and the slave trade. — location: [338](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00N980EQK&location=338) ^ref-61795

---
The colonized Afrikan nation, much more than the new Euro-Amerikan settler nation, was a complete nation — that is, possessing among its people a complete range of applied sciences, practical crafts, and productive labor. Both that colonized nation and the Indian nations were self-sufficient and economically whole, while the Euro-Amerikan invasion society was parasitic. — location: [351](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00N980EQK&location=351) ^ref-13746

---
Afrikans were the landless, propertyless, permanent workers of the U.S. Empire. They were not just slaves — the Afrikan nation as a whole served as a proletariat for the Euro-Amerikan oppressor nation. This Afrikan colony supported on its shoulders the building of a Euro-Amerikan society more “prosperous,” more “egalitarian,” and yes, more “democratic” than any in semi-feudal Old Europe. The Jeffersonian vision of Amerika as a pastoral European democracy was rooted in the national life of small, independent white landowners. — location: [369](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00N980EQK&location=369) ^ref-47103

In the early decades of Virginia’s tobacco industry, gangs of white indentured servants worked the fields side-by-side with Afrikan and Indian slaves, whom in the 1600s they greatly outnumbered. — location: [456](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00N980EQK&location=456) ^ref-32235

No one, we note, has yet summoned up the audacity to maintain that the Indians too wished to fight and die for settler “democracy.” Yet that same claim is advanced for Afrikan prisoners (slaves), as though they either had more common interests with their slavemasters, or were more brainwashed. — location: [482](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00N980EQK&location=482) ^ref-59943

“Bacon and his men did not kill a single enemy Indian but contented themselves with frightening away, killing, or enslaving most of the friendly neighboring Indians, and taking their beaver and land as spoils.” — location: [583](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00N980EQK&location=583) ^ref-9609

Killing, enslaving, and robbing was the exact central concern of this movement — which Euro-Amerikans tell us is an example of how we should unite with them!

The enrollment of the white masses into new, mass instruments of repression — such as the formation of the infamous Slave Patrols in Virginia in 1727 — is obviously anti-democratic and reactionary. Yet these opposites in form are, in their essence, united as aspects of creating the new citizenry of Babylon. — location: [665](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00N980EQK&location=665) ^ref-13445

1776 War of Independence, a war in which most of the Indian and Afrikan peoples opposed settler nationhood and the consolidation of Amerika. In fact, the majority of oppressed people gladly allied themselves to the British forces in hopes of crushing the settlers. — location: [669](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00N980EQK&location=669) ^ref-52951

The decisive point came when British capitalism decided to clip the wings of the new Euro-Amerikan bourgeoisie — they restricted emigration, hampered industry and trade, and pursued a long-range plan to confine the settler population to a controllable strip of territory along the Atlantic seacoast. — location: [672](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00N980EQK&location=672) ^ref-59218

the settler bourgeoisie was, in the main, conservative and uncertain about actual war. It was the land question that in the end proved decisive in swaying the doubtful among the settler elite. — location: [678](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00N980EQK&location=678) ^ref-13563

The British Quebec Act of 1773, however, attached all the Amerikan Midwest to British Canada.

Far from being either patriotic Amerikan subjects or passively enslaved neutrals, the Afrikan masses threw themselves daringly and passionately into the jaws of war on an unprecedented scale — that is, into their own war, against slave Amerika and for freedom. — location: [704](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00N980EQK&location=704) ^ref-4182

the Euro-Amerikan settlers, sitting on the dynamite of a restive, nationally oppressed Afrikan population, were terrified — and outraged. — location: [709](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00N980EQK&location=709) ^ref-23276

By the thousands upon thousands, Afrikans struggled to reach British lines. One historian of the Exodus has said: “The British move was countered by the Americans, who exercised closer vigilance over their slaves, removed the able-bodied to interior places far from the scene of the war, and threatened with dire punishment all who sought to join the enemy. To Negroes attempting to flee to the British the alternatives ‘Liberty or Death’ took on an almost literal meaning. — location: [723](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00N980EQK&location=723) ^ref-51152

Many Afrikans were disarmed and put back into chains at the war’s end, despite solemn settler promises. John Hancock, President of the Continental Congress, may have presented Afrikan U.S. troops with a banner — which praised them as “The Bucks of America” — but that didn’t help Afrikans such as Captain Mark Starlin. He was the first Afrikan captain in the Amerikan naval forces, and had won many honors for his near-suicidal night raids on the British fleet (which is why the settlers let him and his all-Afrikan crew sail alone). But as soon as the war ended, his master simply reclaimed him. Starlin spent the rest of his life as a slave. — location: [765](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00N980EQK&location=765) ^ref-39627

three hundred Afrikan ex-slaves fought an extended guerrilla campaign against the planters in both Georgia and South Carolina. Originally allied to the British forces, they continued their independent campaign long after the British defeat. They were not overcome until 1786, when their secret fort at Bear Creek was discovered and overwhelmed. — location: [786](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00N980EQK&location=786) ^ref-33643

South Carolina’s Lynch stated that since Afrikans were property they shouldn’t be taxed any more than sheep were. Franklin acidly replied: “Sheep will never make insurrection!”[71] — location: [811](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00N980EQK&location=811) ^ref-10935

President Jefferson’s solution to this dilemma was to take all Afrikan children away from their parents for compact shipment to the West Indies and Afrika, while keeping the adults enslaved to support the Amerikan economy for the rest of their lives. — location: [824](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00N980EQK&location=824) ^ref-51946

Jefferson mused: “…the old stock would die off in the ordinary course of nature … until its final disappearance.” The President thought this Hitlerian fantasy both “practicable” and “blessed.” — location: [828](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00N980EQK&location=828) ^ref-12692

So many Afrikans were involved in that planned uprising that one Southern newspaper declared that prosecutions had to be halted lest it bankrupt the Richmond capitalists by causing “the annihilation of the Blacks in this part of the country.”[79] — location: [879](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00N980EQK&location=879) ^ref-63765

One immediate response in the 1830s was to break up the Afrikan communities in the cities. In the wake of the Vesey conspiracy, for instance, the Charleston City Council urged that the number of male Afrikans in the city “be greatly diminished.”[82] — location: [893](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00N980EQK&location=893) ^ref-60280

while there were great differences in wealth and power, there was a shared privilege among settlers. Few were exploited in the scientific socialist sense of being a wage-slave of capital; in fact, wage labor for another man was looked down upon by whites as a mark of failure (and still is by many). — location: [969](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00N980EQK&location=969) ^ref-51033

this new class of white workers was indeed angry and militant, but so completely dominated by petit-bourgeois consciousness that they always ended up as the pawns of various bourgeois political factions.

free Afrikan communities in the North opposed these reform movements of the settler masses. The reason is easy to grasp: Everywhere in the North, the pre–Civil War popular struggles to enlarge the political powers of the settler masses also had the program of taking away civil rights from Afrikans.

increasingly the Afrikan masses were involuntarily dispersed, scattered into the refugee camps of the Northern ghettoes, removed from established positions in industries and trades that were an irreplaceable part of the modern Nation.

the peculiar chemical-mechanized U.S. agriculture is itself highly specialized, primarily oriented around the subsidized mass production of feed grains. Two-thirds of all U.S. agricultural exports are feed grains used in raising livestock. Most of these exports are to the industrial powers — Europe, Japan, and the USSR — while much of the $16 billion in foodstuffs the U.S. imports each year is from the Third World. In Mexico the neocolonial economy imports grain from the U.S. to raise meat for the upper and middle classes, while exporting significant amounts of its own food productivity.[434] — location: [5273](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00N980EQK&location=5273) ^ref-26191

at a time when the Empire had decided that Afrikans were again too rebellious to be employed in any great numbers in key industrial, commercial, and professional institutions, Euro-Amerikan women were recruited to stand by their men in filling up the jobs. “Equal Opportunity” in medical schools, law schools, business, etc. meant a large influx of Euro-Amerikan women — and few Afrikans. — location: [5552](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00N980EQK&location=5552) ^ref-8074

intra-oppressor class distinctions have always been muted on the mass level by the fact that the main distinction was whether you were a settler or a subject, whether you were in the slave patrols or enslaved in the fields, whether you were in the frontier garrison community or imprisoned in the reservation.
