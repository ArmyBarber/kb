## Highlights
The steady advance, and cultural power, of marketing and advertising has caused “the displacement of a political public sphere by a depoliticized consumer culture.” — location: [224](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0055PJ4R0&location=224) ^ref-39027

---
In contrast to the standard conception of the media as cantankerous, obstinate, and ubiquitous in their search for truth and their independence of authority, we have spelled out and applied a propaganda model that indeed sees the media as serving a “societal purpose,” but not that of enabling the public to assert meaningful control over the political process by providing them with the information needed for the intelligent discharge of political responsibilities. — location: [7552](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0055PJ4R0&location=7552) ^ref-16523

---
a propaganda model suggests that the “societal purpose” of the media is to inculcate and defend the economic, social, and political agenda of privileged groups that dominate the domestic society and the state. The media serve this purpose in many ways: through selection of topics, distribution of concerns, framing of issues, filtering of information, emphasis and tone, and by keeping debate within the bounds of acceptable premises. — location: [7556](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0055PJ4R0&location=7556) ^ref-60445

---
the media’s lack of interest, investigative zeal, and basic news reporting on the accumulating illegalities of the executive branch have regularly permitted and even encouraged ever larger violations of law, whose ultimate exposure when elite interests were threatened is offered as a demonstration of media service “on behalf of the polity.” — location: [7618](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0055PJ4R0&location=7618) ^ref-49388

---
As we have stressed throughout this book, the U.S. media do not function in the manner of the propaganda system of a totalitarian state. Rather, they permit—indeed, encourage—spirited debate, criticism, and dissent, as long as these remain faithfully within the system of presuppositions and principles that constitute an elite consensus, a system so powerful as to be internalized largely without awareness. — location: [7650](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0055PJ4R0&location=7650) ^ref-57987

---
In the category of supportive factors, we find, first of all, elemental patriotism, the overwhelming wish to think well of ourselves, our institutions, and our leaders. — location: [7700](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0055PJ4R0&location=7700) ^ref-41833

---
We see ourselves as basically good and decent in personal life, so it must be that our institutions function in accordance with the same benevolent intent, an argument that is often persuasive even though it is a transparent non sequitur. — location: [7702](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0055PJ4R0&location=7702) ^ref-54179

---
If one chooses to denounce Qaddafi, or the Sandinistas, or the PLO, or the Soviet Union, no credible evidence is required. The same is true if one repeats conventional doctrines about our own society and its behavior—say, that the U.S. government is dedicated to our traditional noble commitment to democracy and human rights. — location: [7706](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0055PJ4R0&location=7706) ^ref-6052

---
a critical analysis of American institutions, the way they function domestically and their international operations, must meet far higher standards; in fact, standards are often imposed that can barely be met in the natural sciences. One has to work hard, to produce evidence that is credible, to construct serious arguments, to present extensive documentation—all tasks that are superfluous as long as one remains within the presuppositional framework of the doctrinal consensus. It is small wonder that few are willing to undertake the effort, — location: [7708](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0055PJ4R0&location=7708) ^ref-61298

---
In sum, the mass media of the United States are effective and powerful ideological institutions that carry out a system-supportive propaganda function by reliance on market forces, internalized assumptions, and self-censorship, and without significant overt coercion. This propaganda system has become even more efficient in recent decades with the rise of the national television networks, greater mass-media concentration, right-wing pressures on public radio and television, and the growth in scope and sophistication of public relations and news management. — location: [7722](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0055PJ4R0&location=7722) ^ref-10463

The organization and self-education of groups in the community and workplace, and their networking and activism, continue to be the fundamental elements in steps toward the democratization of our social life and any meaningful social change. Only to the extent that such developments succeed can we hope to see media that are free and independent. — location: [7758](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0055PJ4R0&location=7758) ^ref-28874
