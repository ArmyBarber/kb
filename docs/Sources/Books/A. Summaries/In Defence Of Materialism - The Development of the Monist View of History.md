## Chapter I French Materialism of the Eighteenth Century

 - What is materialism in general and philosophical sense?
 - French materialists of the18th century had a lot of contradictions they they either couldn't address or weren't even aware of
	 - Some actually move thought forward, push it forward in addressing the contradiction
		 - Hegel: "contradiction leads the way forward"
 - V.V - Vasily Vorontsov
 - Main contradiction of French materialists: *"the opinions of men are determined by their environment; the environment is determined by opinions"*
 - Sample contradiction to think through: "the constitution of a given people is conditioned by the manners of that people; the manners of a people are conditioned by its constitution"
 - To overcome: need to discover the historical factor which produced both the manners of a people and its constitution, making the interaction between them possible
