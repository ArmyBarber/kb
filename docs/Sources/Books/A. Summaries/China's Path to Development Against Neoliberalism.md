China is wholly locked with US imperialism in a struggle for existence. China’s rise shatters the power image of the US, and by implication its dominant ideas.

For capital and its totality of social production, any improvement in living standards in the hinterland or an increase in the power of China would   erode the foundation of surplus value creation.   These would also curtail   the power the US deploys to organise production and to   snatch value or transfer value through finance to the centre. Correspondingly,   China hinders two operations of imperialism, the concentration and centralisation of capital.
