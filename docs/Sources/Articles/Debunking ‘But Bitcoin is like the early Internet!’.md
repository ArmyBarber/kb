[[Blockchain is BS as technology and asset and potential|On blockchain]]

Great piece destroying the claims that Bitcoin is "like the early internet!" (it may be hard to see the potential now, but that has been the case with other technologies before, that later ended up having an enormous impact!)

For one, many people did see the current use as well as future potential of the internet in its early days

And with many technologies, it's easy to see how improved technology could make it more feasible
- Ex- video calls. At first, maybe a crappy video could be sent over dial up. But you could envision faster connections allowing quicker transmission and/or higher quality files. And maybe even doing it live at some point!
- w/ crypto, it's not entirely clear what the advantage is in the first place, that could maybe later be improved upon
