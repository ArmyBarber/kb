## Common contradictory propositions from Western left:
1. one nation cannot exploit another; 
2. there is no such thing as monopoly capitalism as the economic basis of imperialism; 
3. imperialist rivalry and exploitation between nations has been displaced by global class struggles within a fully globalized transnational capitalism; 
4. all great powers today are capitalist nations engaged in interimperialist struggle; 
5. imperialist nations can be judged primarily on a democratic-authoritarian spectrum, so that not all imperialisms are created equal; 
6. imperialism is simply a political policy of aggression of one state against another; 
7. humanitarian imperialism designed to protect human rights is justified; 
8. the dominant classes in the Global South are no longer anti-imperialist and are either transnationalist or subimperialist in orientation; 
9. the “anti-imperialist left” is “Manichean” in its support of the morally “good” Global South against the morally “bad” Global North; 
10. economic imperialism has now been “reversed” with the Global East/South now exploiting the Global West/North; 
11. China and the United States head rival imperialist blocs; and 
12. Lenin was mainly a theorist of interimperialism, not of the imperialism of center and periphery
