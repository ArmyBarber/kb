>Fascism is as co-constitutive of capitalism as liberalism is. Liberalism corresponds to the operational aspect of surplus value exploitation in the core, whereas fascism corresponds to the operational aspect of primitive accumulation at its temporal and spatial boundaries.

>Describing fascism as the “death-rattle” of stage four obscures the fact that it has been present from the outset. Fascism is just the operational aspect that the unlucky part of the globe gets to experience capitalism _as._ We need to expand the model into a second dimension to integrate this understanding.

> 4.  Capitalism — Ideological superstructure in defense of _individual genius_ (entrepreneurship, race science, will to power)
>     -   Expropriative aspect: Primitive accumulation, fascism.
>     -   Exploitative aspect: Wage labour, liberalism.

>This model conceives of the Axis powers as _failed_ fascist experiments in empire-building, and the North Atlantic empires as _successful_ ones. Fascism as an accusation stops relying on a cartoonish depiction of the Nazis as a cautionary tale of a potential future dystopia. Instead, it captures the fact that vicious dehumanizing brutality is _co-constitutive_ of the violent, white supremacist, “freedom-loving” Western worldview.
