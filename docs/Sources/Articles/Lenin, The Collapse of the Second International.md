In which Lenin discusses the "revolutionary situation", specifically [[Objective conditions of revolution|objective conditions]] independent of the will of groups/parties/passes, without which revolution cannot occur.

>To the Marxist it is indisputable that a revolution is impossible without a revolutionary situation; furthermore, it is not every revolutionary situation that leads to revolution. What, generally speaking, are the symptoms of a revolutionary situation? We shall certainly not be mistaken if we indicate the following three major symptoms: (1) when it is impossible for the ruling classes to maintain their rule without any change; when there is a crisis, in one form or another, among the “upper classes”, a crisis in the policy of the ruling class, leading to a fissure through which the discontent and indignation of the oppressed classes burst forth. For a revolution to take place, it is usually insufficient for “the lower classes not to want” to live in the old   way; it is also necessary that “the upper classes should be unable” to live in the old way; (2) when the suffering and want of the oppressed classes have grown more acute than usual; (3) when, as a consequence of the above causes, there is a considerable increase in the activity of the masses, who uncomplainingly allow themselves to be robbed in “peace time”, but, in turbulent times, are drawn both by all the circumstances of the crisis _and by the “upper classes” themselves_ into independent historical action.

>Without these objective changes, which are independent of the will, not only of individual groups and parties but even of individual classes, a revolution, as a general rule, is impossible. The totality of all these objective changes is called a revolutionary situation.

[[Lenin, The Collapse of the Second International]]

Breaking down passage above:
- Revolutionary situation is necessary, but not sufficient
	- "it is indisputable that a revolution is impossible without a revolutionary situation; furthermore, it is not every revolutionary situation that leads to revolution"
- Necessity of a crisis during which the ruling class cannot maintain the status quo without change
- Increased want/suffering of oppressed classes
- In light of the above, increased activity of the masses
