The above tweet brings up a much discussed point regarding what can be done to build communism in the imperial core, where many workers are content enough with their material conditions, occasionally seeking scrap concessions.

[@psaczkowski](https://twitter.com/psaczkowski) mentions if our role is limited to managing the fall out as imperialist links continue breaking, which seems to imply there's nothing we can do here until imperialist links are broken (depending on how much people in the core themselves can influence that, vs it being all on the periphery gaining freedom).

- Benefitting from imperialism, or worse off?
- Material gains to be had despite "trinkets"?
- Does that only amount to wanting to "spread the loot"?
	- If such gains were attainable in the first place, maybe
	- Lack of them while war continues gives, at least the appearance of mutual exclusion
- [[Objective conditions of revolution]] vs [[Subjective conditions of revolution|subjective conditions]]
