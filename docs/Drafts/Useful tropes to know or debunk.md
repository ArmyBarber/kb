Brainstorming:

- Something related to capitalists creating value, related to an inflation of their importance (they take the risk!)

	- How notions of "nonviolence" mask inherent violence in upholding status quo (not to mention violence in creating it)
- Betrayal/revolution betrayed (usually person-focused but can be movement itself)
	- Lenin betrayed the Russian revolution
	- Stalin betrayed Lenin/the other Bolsheviks
	- Deng betrayed Mao/the entire revolution, etc

> 	- Always inspired by the most noble Communist sentiments, the masses were regularly betrayed by their leaders and the bureaucrats. And this is also paradoxical because what was intended to be a complaint of the masses against the leaders and bureaucrats converts abruptly into an indictment against the masses. The analysis reveals the masses to be completely irredeemable simpletons who are entirely unable to comprehend their own interests at decisive moments. They long to consign their fate to swashbucklers. And here once again we see an overarching idealism; deception and betrayal by swashbucklers is supposed to explain all of world history.
