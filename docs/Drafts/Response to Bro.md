## Background
$\qquad$Context: a dear friend of mine I shall simply refer to as "Bro" (not my sibling but a bro nonetheless) and I had been having some back and forth about various topics, but Russia/Ukraine had been a part of it. I gave general thoughts about the war, boiling down to how my view was that although no war would be ideal, the lack of feasible alternatives for Russia left an operation of some sort the only remaining option, and that given the onset of such an operation, a path to sustainable peace ASAP would be the best outcome - that furthering the war on Ukraine's end by interfering with potential peace talks and continually arming them would only lead to a worse fate for Ukraine at the end of the day. 

$\qquad$He also asked about my thoughts about Putin in general. Without trying to go overboard in response length, my response boiled down to saying that any evaluation of him should start with the context in which he came to power. The immediate years following the collapse of the USSR and under Yeltsin were absolutely devastating. Putin stopped the process of completely selling out Russia to the West and helped stabilize conditions for the nation. For that reasons I believe he was good for Russia at the time and remains so - if enough Russian people were upset with him to seek another leader, that is their right to do so. It does not, however, appear to be the case (he appears to have the support of most Russian people). Eventually he responded:

>i guess basically i get why you are so anti-US and generally agree, it's just hard for me to see how you can look at russia and feel any enthusiasm at all. like, . . . a couple months ago, you said something like 'a leader who genuinely cared about ending college debt would find a way to end all college debt.' by that logic, wouldn't a leader who genuinely cared about world peace and human welfare find a way to not invade a country and get thousands of people killed? does it bother you at all that years before ukraine he was championed as a "solid leader" by the fascist american right? isn't he a multibillionaire? how does this person in any way reflect the kind of world you want to build?

## Outline response to points/questions

Initial point: am a [[Scientific socialism|scientific socialist ]] . Involves looking for realistic (not idealistic) solutions to problems. Applies outside of socialist thought specifically as well. I'd love to work 4-6 hour days, 4 day weeks, have access to affordable childcare, subsidized housing etc. That's not the world I live in, but unlike conservatives or reactionaries saying "tough shit, that's the way its been/is/always will be", I think there are worthy goals and recognize a path is needed to get there.

- a couple months ago, you said something like 'a leader who genuinely cared about ending college debt would find a way to end all college debt.'

Re: [[student loan debt]] Biden could have used executive order[^1] or the Fed could buy up the debt[^2], to implement a plan that isn't limited and means tested[^3][^4], instead of spending years acting like even the meager act he ended up passing (now held up in court)[^5] wouldn't be possible[^6]. Now if I said the same thing about, say, healthcare instead of student loan relief, I realize there would be much more work to do (though a leader who genuinely cared would at least be campaigning/pushing for something like [[Medicare for all would save money and improve lives|Medicare for all]], popularizing the idea and calling out people in the way of getting something passed). But assuming such effort was clearly put in and obstructionism or w/e outside forces still got in the way, I would understand it was beyond the ability of the President.

Although counterfactuals for historical events can be frowned upon, I think, if reasonably made, they can have value. Take the US Civil War: if you say "Lincoln should have restored the Union but without all the deaths" - how do you propose that could have happened? If there's not something you can point to, it's likely an idealist wish with no basis in reality. Or say you believe more should have done to prevent the South from seceding. One could point to numerous statements from Lincoln about how he had no wish to interfere with slavery in the South. After secession/war, however, freeing Southern slaves - first through treating escaped slaves as contraband (thus with no obligation to return to owner), and later through Emancipation Proclamation was done. One could point to this as proof of Lincoln's insincerity regarding not wanting to interfere with slavery in the South, but the change in circumstance at that point should be acknowledged.
