>a  couple months ago, you said something like 'a leader who genuinely cared about ending college debt would find a way to end all college debt.' by that logic, wouldn't a leader who genuinely cared about world peace and human welfare find a way to not invade a country and get thousands of people killed?

What attracted me to Marxism was the focus on concrete material analysis. [[Scientific socialism]], as opposed to [[Utopian socialism|utopian]] is focused on understanding the historical context of a situation, the workings of the dominant systems, and the possibilities resulting - not simply wishing for things to be a certain way. 
> World-historical existence of individuals means existence of individuals which is directly linked up with world history.
> Communism is for us not a _state of affairs_ which is to be established, an _ideal_ to which reality [will] have to adjust itself. We call communism the _real_ movement which abolishes the present state of things. The conditions of this movement result from the premises now in existence."[^1]

Re: [[student loan debt]] Biden could have used executive order[^2] or the Fed could buy up the debt[^3], to implement a plan that isn't limited and means tested[^4][^5], instead of spending years acting like even the meager act he ended up passing (now held up in court)[^6] wouldn't be possible[^7]. Now if I said the same thing about, say, healthcare instead of student loan relief, I realize there would be much more work to do (though a leader who genuinely cared would at least be campaigning/pushing for something like [[Medicare for all would save money and improve lives|Medicare for all]], popularizing the idea and calling out people in the way of getting something passed). But assuming such effort was clearly put in and obstructionism or w/e outside forces still got in the way, I would understand it was beyond the ability of the President to simply make it so.

Regarding Ukraine, an excellent article from 2014 by John Mearsheimer lays out steps the West could take to avoid a crisis (all ignored) while laying out the consequences otherwise and how that would be a disaster for Ukraine.[^8] One needs to consider [[US pledge in 1991 to not expand NATO an inch in the East]] and the multiple times that had been disregarding in the years since, leading up to talks of Ukraine joining NATO. There's the [[2014 Maidan Coup in Ukraine|US backed coup in 2014 putting far right nationalist gov in place]]. The subsequent attacks on civilians[^9] [^10] It is important to remember that Russia historically has suffered great losses from forces entering their territory through the region of Ukraine. [[Domenico Losurdo interviewed by Opera Magazine (2017)#^c4b812|Seeking to avoid being colonized is a genuine concern of Russia's]], particularly in the [[Devastation following the collapse of the USSR|context of the decline following the fall of the USSR.]]

The attempt at peace via the [[Minsk agreements following 2014 Maidan Coup in Ukraine|Minsk agreements]]. The initial failures leading to the Steinmeier Formula[^11] in 2016 calling for elections to be held in Donbass and potential self-governing status depending the results. All this time, the people of Donbass pleading for Russian military aid while Ukraine continues to assault indiscriminately, leading to more than 14,000 deaths while Putin declined intervention, seeking a working agreement. [^12] Yet it seems the West never intended on any agreement holding, instead seeing such talks as buying time while Ukraine could build up its forces. [^13] When asked if he agreed with Angela Merkel's assessment that the Minsk negotiations were intended to buy Ukraine time rather than seeking a stable arrangement, former French president François Hollande replied "Yes, Angela Merkel is right on this point."[^14]
Regarding the eventual Russian decision to intervene, frequently described as "unprovoked" in Western media, Chomsky claims "Of course, it was provoked. Otherwise, they wouldn’t refer to it all the time as an unprovoked invasion."[^15] Of course he is clear to note that this is not a justification, though what steps/response Russia could have instead taken is less clear. Russia long sought assurances over Ukraine membership in NATO to no avail.[^16] In the eight years since Mearsheimer's 2014 analysis, he contends the West is still at fault for the crisis[^17]. Early on following Russia's intervention (distinct from "the start of the conflict", as that goes back to 2014), when peace talks were a possibility, Western powers advised Zelensky against any such moves[^18] (what possible benefit Ukraine could get from holding out is unclear - on the contrary their position will continue to deteriorate in all likelihood). Indeed, NATO seems content on fighting Russia down to the last Ukrainian[^19]

Do you understand the historical situation facing Russia, and the concerns they have voiced repeatedly over the years, to no avail? What option outside of military action was available to stop the continued slaughter of the people of Donbass? Putin tried for years to seek a workable agreement (a move he now regrets) while the West admits it was merely to buy time for Ukraine to strengthen itself. If you believe there's a reasonable alternative path that addresses all the very real concerns Russia has, by all means share. If you simply wish there was no fighting involving Russian forces starting in 2022 (remember, Donbass has faced 14,000 deaths since 2014) because that would seem nice, please reassess your preference in light of reality.
