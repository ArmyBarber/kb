>Basically it seems like Kadri throws away the whole Leninist theory of imperialism. How can you base your theory of imperialism around anything but the concrete dynamics of oppressed and oppressor nations,  the agrarian question, parasitism and labor aristocracy, etc. how can he introduce imperialism as a module of the capitalism system of “phenomenal waste”? And how is this not just a dressed up version of underconsumptionism as in Luxemburg

>Which is a revision of the marxist theory of anarchy of production

Regarding views on imperialism, worth reading paper co-authored by Kadri, [[The Imperialist Question A Sociological Approach.pdf|"The Imperialist Question: A Sociological Approach"]][^1]
>Interestingly, the more the US consolidated its unilateral hegemonic role in world affairs, the more those theories that most incisively had analysed the global order (Dependency, World-System and Marxian theories) were completely rendered obsolete, even as the weight of US-led imperialist policies (via sanctions, wars, and neoliberal reforms) unravelled over the region and the global South at large. 6 Unfortunately, in doing so, such analyses have offered an abstract and too ahistorical picture of the reality on the ground, which fails to articulate the historical development and political trajectory of these countries vis-à-vis US-led imperialism. While dismissing, for so long, the weight of history that US-led imperialism has had on the entire world, the gradual economic rise of China has now brought scholars to talk about multiple imperialism( s). This move, as we will show, has only created further confusion. In this article, we set to explain the main limitations of these approaches and to recentre the study of the region in relation to the imperialist question, namely US-led imperialism.[^2]
