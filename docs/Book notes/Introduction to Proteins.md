When the allowed ϕ and ψ values are applied to a model of the protein chain, simple local folds emerge, such as coils, loops, and extended shapes. — location: [59421](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A8SN5I8&location=59421) ^ref-32299

Specifically, each bond is formed between a backbone carbonyl group (C = O) and a backbone amide group (N–H) located four positions downstream in the sequence — location: [61604](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A8SN5I8&location=61604) ^ref-34199

it seems that α-helices in proteins are in fact stabilized by nonpolar and van der Waals interactions involving the side-chains of residues, particularly their Cα atom[148,149] — location: [62479](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A8SN5I8&location=62479) ^ref-47503

---
acidic glutamate and aspartate residues tend to occupy the N’ of α-helices, where they can favorably interact with the partially positive charge and further stabilize the helix.[153,154] The same happens with basic Lys and Arg residues at the C’. — location: [62481](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A8SN5I8&location=62481) ^ref-7867

π helix has ϕ and ψ backbone angles of –57° and –70° (respectively),[145] rendering it shorter and wider than the canonical α-helix (Figure 2.15c), with 4.4 residues per turn on average. — location: [63789](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A8SN5I8&location=63789) ^ref-16127

Like the 310 helix, the π helix also tends to appear at the edges of α-helices, where it occupies no more than a few residues. — location: [63790](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A8SN5I8&location=63790) ^ref-1580

PPII, can be observed in proteins in their natural aqueous environment. This is a left-handed helix, in which all peptide bonds are in their trans configuration (ϕ, ψ, ω = –75°, + 180°,145°) — location: [63791](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A8SN5I8&location=63791) ^ref-37421

---
In folded proteins PPII helices tend to be amphipathic, and therefore reside at the periphery of the globular structure.[50] — location: [63792](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A8SN5I8&location=63792) ^ref-26825

SH3 — location: [64226](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A8SN5I8&location=64226) ^ref-24079

The&nbsp;SRC Homology 3 Domain&nbsp;(or&nbsp;SH3 domain) is a small protein domain of about 60&nbsp;amino acids&nbsp;residues first identified as a&nbsp;conserved sequence&nbsp;in the viral adaptor protein v-Crk and the non-catalytic parts of enzymes such as phospholipase and several cytoplasmic&nbsp;tyrosine kinases&nbsp;such asAbl&nbsp;and&nbsp;Src.[1][2

The SH3 domain has a characteristic&nbsp;beta-barrel&nbsp;fold that consists of five or six&nbsp;β-strandsarranged as two tightly packed anti-parallel β sheets. The linker regions may contain short helices. The SH3-type fold is an ancient fold found in eukaryotes as well as prokaryotes.[6]

The classical SH3 domain is usually found in proteins that interact with other proteins and mediate assembly of specific protein complexes, typically via binding to proline-rich peptides in their respective binding partner

PPII helices are common in denatured proteins, — location: [64226](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A8SN5I8&location=64226) ^ref-58964

---
In other words, intramolecular hydrogen bonds do not occur in order to stabilize α-helices and β-sheets, as traditionally argued in many textbooks. Quite the contrary; the secondary structures are used to allow hydrogen-bond formation, thus reducing the high de-solvation cost associated with the transfer of the protein’s backbone groups from the aqueous phase into the low-dielectric core of the protein. Indeed, ~50% of protein residues, and virtually all of them within the core, exist as part of α-helices or β-sheets. — location: [65975](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A8SN5I8&location=65975) ^ref-42529

The second is efficient pairing of backbone amide and carbonyl groups in hydrogen bonds, needed to reduce the destabilizing effect of their de-solvation. — location: [65976](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A8SN5I8&location=65976) ^ref-59299

Membrane proteins are the exception; there, proline residues can be found quite often inside membrane-crossing α-helices, — location: [67723](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A8SN5I8&location=67723) ^ref-22099

Gly is over-represented at the C-terminus of helices, and is considered a “helix terminator.” — location: [67724](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A8SN5I8&location=67724) ^ref-28044

At the C-termini of both parallel and anti-parallel β-sheets the preferred amino acids are Asp, Asn, Ser, and Pro. — location: [68159](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A8SN5I8&location=68159) ^ref-39870

---
An interesting possibility may be that these residues are preferred not because they stabilize the β structure per se, but rather because they prevent the formation of α-helices in that region. — location: [68595](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A8SN5I8&location=68595) ^ref-64809

---
each Ig fold is basically a β-sandwich, including nine strands and loops. Interestingly, the specificity of antigen binding is determined by the six loops in the structure (three from each chain), rather than the strands. — location: [72967](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A8SN5I8&location=72967) ^ref-53237

---
structural flexibility of the loops increases the variability of the antigen-binding site even beyond the level conferred by sequence variations.[228] That is, the loops are capable of undergoing spontaneous conformational changes, which change the shape of the binding site, and as a result, allow the same antibody to bind different antigens. — location: [73838](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A8SN5I8&location=73838) ^ref-19017

heating a sample containing a macromolecule is not accompanied by a temperature increase (as would normally be expected†), as long as there are intact interactions left within the macromolecule. — location: [131510](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A8SN5I8&location=131510) ^ref-44716

---
However, in cases where folding involves the burial of non-polar atoms inside the macromolecule (as in the case of proteins), the hydrophobic effect driving this process[9] is accompanied by an increase in the entropy of the aqueous solvent. — location: [131512](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A8SN5I8&location=131512) ^ref-54243

---
the increase in solvent entropy over-compensates for the loss of entropy of the macromolecule, thus leading to an overall (favorable) increase in the entropy of the whole system. — location: [131947](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A8SN5I8&location=131947) ^ref-55361

another definition of ΔS: In an exothermic (heat releasing) process, ΔS expresses the number of molecular states of the surroundings, over which the heat energy can be dispersed, — location: [131947](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A8SN5I8&location=131947) ^ref-58078

---
when a system contains a high number of configurational states over which heat can be dispersed, it will take more heat to produce a temperature change, or, in other words, the heat capacity of the system will be higher. — location: [131948](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A8SN5I8&location=131948) ^ref-44334

Brandts reached a similar conclusion in 1964, following his studies on chymotripsinogen.[29,30] However, he concluded that the two opposable effects are entropy and enthalpy, where in fact, they are both entropic in nature. — location: [134571](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A8SN5I8&location=134571) ^ref-21777

As such, its expression is not limited to the eyes, but also occurs in other tissues, primarily the heart, kidneys, and striated muscles. — location: [152920](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A8SN5I8&location=152920) ^ref-26656

The probability of the protein to acquire a certain substate (P) depends inversely and exponentially on its free energy (ΔG), — location: [155540](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A8SN5I8&location=155540) ^ref-55562

the protein is expected to spend most of the time occupying those substates that have the least energy. — location: [155976](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A8SN5I8&location=155976) ^ref-14452

proteins, the secondary elements in disordered proteins tend to change or disappear constantly, due to the lack of stabilizing tertiary interactions. — location: [155980](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A8SN5I8&location=155980) ^ref-55646

The quantum-mechanical (QM) treatment acknowledges that each reactant has a most probable location, but also less probable ones, which may even be on the other side of the reaction’s energy barrier. — location: [157289](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A8SN5I8&location=157289) ^ref-10823

mutations that have so far eluded scientists due to their distant locations and their non-additive effect on tunneling have been found to act by disrupting the network of coupled vibrations that optimize the tunneling process. — location: [157726](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00A8SN5I8&location=157726) ^ref-3614
