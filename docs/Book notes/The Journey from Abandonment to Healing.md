---
tendency to produce higher concentrations of norepinephrine, a brain chemical involved in arousal of your body’s self-defense response. This would mean that your threshold for becoming aroused is lowered, and you are more likely to become anxious when you encounter stresses in life that are reminiscent of childhood fears and experiences, hence more prone to becoming post-traumatic. — location: [734](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=734) ^ref-56682

I was able to look up and be astounded at how painful loss is. Not just mine. All loss. I started to think about the millions of people who’ve suffered this experience before me and the millions to come. I was on intimate terms with human pain. My touch plate of feeling was alive as never before. And I knew I was forever changed by this knowledge. Painful as this was, it was a gift I would never give away. It made me intensely human.” — location: [978](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=978) ^ref-32473

“I got through my worst moments,” says Amy, “by stopping everything and intently listening for the farthest sound . . . the farthest sound.” — location: [1123](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=1123) ^ref-15288

---
Refocus by using one of your senses whenever you notice that your panic has plucked you out of the moment. Staying in the moment is a skill requiring deliberate effort. — location: [1148](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=1148) ^ref-1638

Some of best healers in our society are those who have been — location: [1181](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=1181) ^ref-50596

through overwhelming trauma, because they have worked through their shattering. — location: [1181](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=1181) ^ref-36178

---
The child fears that unless its urgent pleas are heard, its life is in peril. — location: [1195](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=1195) ^ref-41419

---
Withdrawal is the stage when you listen to the child’s cries. You recognize that her needs are your needs; that you must nurture your most important feelings. — location: [1200](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=1200) ^ref-5542

---
There are those who try to bypass the withdrawal stage with a replacement for their lost love. But withdrawal is not the time for replacement—that will come soon enough—it is the time to accept yourself and your needs. — location: [1201](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=1201) ^ref-27955

---
The effects of withdrawal are cumulative and wavelike. They often have to get worse before they can get better, a point lost on friends who expect to see your desperation dissipate, not mount day after day. — location: [1220](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=1220) ^ref-50641

As a teenager, Keaton didn’t shake the feeling that he needed to prove himself. — location: [1229](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=1229) ^ref-48169

As adults, we’re capable of regression, too. On some level we all need to be reassured of connections to our loved ones. — location: [1325](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=1325) ^ref-41490

I had this horrible vulnerable feeling all of the time like something bad was set to happen any minute. I was stressed out and ready to drop. — location: [1450](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=1450) ^ref-24639

“We are surrounded with the blood, gore, death, and dismemberment of our whole lives.” Upon hearing this, Keaton joked, “Don’t you think, Richard, that that’s a bit understated?” — location: [1464](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=1464) ^ref-52082

free-floating anxiety is one of the post-traumatic symptoms of childhood abandonment. — location: [1636](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=1636) ^ref-7994

---
By going over the pivotal point of loss, you remind yourself why you feel so out of control, that something traumatic really did happen. — location: [1651](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=1651) ^ref-35960

---
You may not have a context memory of your past—and the lack of it may be frustrating to your rational mind, to be sure—but you do have an emotional memory, and that is all you need to make contact with your abandoned child and benefit from the Akeru exercise to follow. — location: [1658](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=1658) ^ref-18292

use the attachment energy to address your innermost needs—the feelings rising out of your abandonment wounds old and new. — location: [1683](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=1683) ^ref-61523

LovingKindness, when practiced regularly for as little as seven minutes at a time, impacts well-being and brain function — location: [1689](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=1689) ^ref-2254

---
trying to reconstruct childhood memories often proves to be a waste of time, effort, and money for even the most determined souls. — location: [1702](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=1702) ^ref-43840

---
I learned for myself that affirmations were not enough to ward off the impact of the abandonment and its potential damage. — location: [2057](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=2057) ^ref-12558

This numbing helps the bereaved survive the initial trauma, — location: [2141](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=2141) ^ref-26446

Love loss and rejection are special kinds of pain that affect your core beliefs about yourself. — location: [2169](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=2169) ^ref-16973

---
At the very heart of the shame is the belief that you are undeserving of love—not attachment-worthy—a critical and potentially damaging belief. This is commonly felt by abandonment survivors, but as potent as it is, it is only a feeling, not a fact. It stems from a wound that we can finally cleanse and heal. You are deserving of love, as we all are. — location: [2296](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=2296) ^ref-18775

people who don’t fight back, who are passive during a crisis, are more likely to develop cancer and other illness. — location: [2368](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=2368) ^ref-49201

You can and should fight the thought that you are somehow unworthy. Take this time alone to examine your life and vindicate your loss by taking positive action. — location: [2370](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=2370) ^ref-41870

---
something rarely recognized as related to self-esteem, yet it is a cornerstone of low self-esteem. It is the need for immediate gratification. — location: [2481](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=2481) ^ref-8036

---
Difficulty delaying gratification is common among abandonment survivors of childhood. It is a source of self-sabotage (the domain of the outer child, to be explored in the next chapter); it interferes with your ability to achieve long-range goals, like Holly’s feeling that she could have become a doctor like her brother. — location: [2485](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=2485) ^ref-17409

---
Those who can wait for gratification are usually those whose self-esteem is in good supply. — location: [2490](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=2490) ^ref-20742

---
The difference is that they feel an urgency rising out of their self-doubt and emotional hunger. It says, “I need a fix now.” — location: [2495](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=2495) ^ref-50524

---
You may recall that empty feeling—those times that you felt you needed something you couldn’t get—when — location: [2498](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=2498) ^ref-39833

---
You believed yourself unworthy or inadequate in some important way. — location: [2502](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=2502) ^ref-7881

---
You grabbed for the quickest, easiest fix you could find—food, television, masturbating, compulsive exercising—anything to stifle those unsettling feelings. — location: [2503](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=2503) ^ref-7331

---
They become adults whose need for immediate gratification interferes with major life goals. They find themselves stuck on the bottom rung of the ladder of success and blame themselves for it. — location: [2505](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=2505) ^ref-7183

---
self-deprecation that is at the heart of these extremes. — location: [2509](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=2509) ^ref-17081

---
they become dependent on anything or anyone capable of soothing, numbing, or distracting them from their emotional hunger. — location: [2511](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=2511) ^ref-13213

---
The antidote to these self-reinforcing patterns of dependency and codependent relationships is to dare to name your goals, to pursue your abandoned dreams, and to fight for higher ground (inspired by those baboons). You learn how to reverse self-abandonment. — location: [2512](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=2512) ^ref-54445

---
Self-abandonment is about loving yourself only enough to give yourself instant gratifications — location: [2514](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=2514) ^ref-61448

---
not enough to postpone those gratifications to take the necessary steps to give yourself what you really desire or need—a trim body, perhaps, or a healthy love relationship, a successful career, or financial stability. Forfeiting our long-range goals to the need for quick fixes is one of the main ways we abandon ourselves. — location: [2515](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=2515) ^ref-34981

---
they fight narcissistic injury with narcissistic defenses. — location: [2534](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=2534) ^ref-34712

---
four cornerstones of self are not based upon your unique talents. The point is not to enumerate your physical attributes, skills, or professional accomplishments. The cornerstones are more basic, addressing the intrinsic, universal aspects of what it means to be a human being. — location: [2536](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=2536) ^ref-51308

You cannot control the love of another, but you can increase your own capacity to give and receive love and all of the benefits that flow from it. — location: [2552](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=2552) ^ref-16456

---
People may think they are strong again, but this outward show of strength is usually only the outer child becoming more firmly entrenched than before. — location: [2717](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=2717) ^ref-64258

---
focus your regrets on the circumstances of your breakup and not on presumed inadequacies that you’ve been blaming for ending your relationship. — location: [2892](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=2892) ^ref-31415

---
Railing against reality is a form of rage that postpones accepting your situation. — location: [2941](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=2941) ^ref-41201

To have serenity, he could not afford to expend his energy railing against reality. — location: [2962](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=2962) ^ref-59317

---
Resentment is low-grade anger that boils just beneath the surface. Even as you begin to get a handle on acute episodes of rage, resentments tend to build. Every day, you deal with repercussions of your loss, indignities of being left, like taking in the groceries by yourself or going to the movies alone. — location: [2976](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=2976) ^ref-45966

You might resent explaining the absence — location: [2979](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=2979) ^ref-61686

---
Emotionally they’re unable to tolerate any break in their connections, even with casual acquaintances. Instead, they accede to whatever the other person expects from them. Their own identity is submerged in the need to be loved and not to be abandoned. — location: [3067](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=3067) ^ref-41383

“So I told her, ‘Roberta, last week, when you reacted to me like I was some sort of nuisance, I felt angry and defensive.

The rage process enables us to break the bonds that have robbed us of our self-expression. Once free of those bonds, you can begin to dismantle old people-pleasing patterns and assert your own preferences, needs, and truth. — location: [3084](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=3084) ^ref-7107

difficulty controlling the way we express anger. Many have trouble asserting anger in a productive way. We flip-flop between overreacting or underreacting. Our attempts to fight back often miss the mark. — location: [3100](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=3100) ^ref-63965

---
One of the reasons aggressive feelings are so often displaced is related to the special nature of abandonment grief—it’s often endured in silence and secrecy. There are few socially sanctioned outlets for expressing it. Is this bottled-up anger at the source of the condition that can also be diagnosed as agitated depression? — location: [3114](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=3114) ^ref-13844

depression is multifaceted. The effects are observed on many levels—psychological, physiological, neurochemical, and even molecular—all of which interact to create a complex condition that we experience as being depressed. — location: [3119](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G3L1BMG&location=3119) ^ref-49068
