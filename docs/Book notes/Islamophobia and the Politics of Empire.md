## Highlights
The focus on “radicalized” Muslim Americans serves not to keep the American people safe, but to whip up a sense of fear and paranoia which can then be used to squash dissent and win consent for violations of civil liberties at home and wars abroad. — location: [174](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0095XK8ZU&location=174) ^ref-20727

the eighteenth century saw the development of notions of European superiority, particularly through the association of the West with democracy and the East with despotism. — location: [621](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0095XK8ZU&location=621) ^ref-42008

---
Rather than examine the historical context of Muslim societies, philologists simply pursued textual analysis. It is no wonder then, as Rodinson notes, that despite the “tremendous amount of accurate information and precise documentation, which the specialists were able to assemble, the rift between their intellectual efforts and the world of objective reality continued to widen.” — location: [641](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0095XK8ZU&location=641) ^ref-56098

---
It followed from this that Islam, as defined by its classical texts, was the key lens through which Muslim-majority societies could be understood. — location: [645](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0095XK8ZU&location=645) ^ref-27224

Starting from this idea that Muslims are a race, Orientalists claimed to be able to explain the “Muslim mind” or the “Arab mind.” — location: [660](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0095XK8ZU&location=660) ^ref-61317

it was not until World War II that the United States began to approach the study of the Middle East systematically, — location: [725](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0095XK8ZU&location=725) ^ref-29088

---
US universities turned toward the production of knowledge instrumental to serving the needs of empire. Two approaches guided the study of the Middle East: Orientalism, which was still dominated by philologists, and social scientific research, from which a new model known as “modernization” would be developed. — location: [736](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0095XK8ZU&location=736) ^ref-33655

---
Such sweeping generalizations, characteristic of Orientalist scholarship, were influential in the United States because they provided a quick and easy way to grasp a large and complex region. — location: [745](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0095XK8ZU&location=745) ^ref-59582

newly decolonized nations were not to oppose economic imperialism and the United States’ access to markets and investment opportunities around the world. — location: [781](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0095XK8ZU&location=781) ^ref-54554

This new form of imperialism required a new language; that language was called “modernization theory.” — location: [788](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0095XK8ZU&location=788) ^ref-59273

---
Modernization theorists didn’t speculate about contemporary societies based on classical texts: they conducted empirical research and gathered data which was evaluated using quantitative data analysis techniques.

It is only by denying the diversity of Islamic history and practices that one can then argue that Islam has certain inherent, unchanging characteristics that render it antidemocratic, violent, sexist, and so on. — location: [865](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0095XK8ZU&location=865) ^ref-9538

the great “liberal” Western tradition is not only mired in sexism but—as the case of Egypt shows—has even played a part in curtailing women’s rights in the East. — location: [979](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0095XK8ZU&location=979) ^ref-17105

the United States has never had an interest in bringing democracy to the people of the Middle East, or to any other people for that matter. — location: [1156](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0095XK8ZU&location=1156) ^ref-46273

beginning in the 1950s, the United States tried to project the king of Saudi Arabia as an “Islamic pole of attraction” against the secular nationalism of Egypt’s Nasser. — location: [1237](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0095XK8ZU&location=1237) ^ref-60538

Israeli politics shifted to the right in the mid-1970s as the parties of the religious right started to play a more prominent role in mainstream politics. This shift inaugurated the use of more prejudicial language against Arabs and Muslims in the public sphere. — location: [1477](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0095XK8ZU&location=1477) ^ref-23693

Some have argued that at times Israel even funded the Islamists.49 The Islamists, in turn, routinely clashed with secular nationalists and far-left forces. — location: [1489](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0095XK8ZU&location=1489) ^ref-53331

---
the dominant thinking in policy circles was that violent Islamists were one force among many that could upset its post–Cold War vision. However, pockets of the ruling elite, particularly the neoconservatives, began to write about “Islamic fundamentalism” as a potential key threat to US interests. The Israeli political class similarly tried to win the United States and Europe to viewing Islamism as their new larger-than-life enemy. — location: [1538](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0095XK8ZU&location=1538) ^ref-21364

the rise of contemporary political Islam is not the reemergence of a medieval clergy crusading against modernity but rather a modern urban phenomenon born of the crises created by capitalism. — location: [1987](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0095XK8ZU&location=1987) ^ref-25469

Hamas has recruited heavily from the refugee camps created by Israel, and while it has the support of businesspeople, the middle class, merchants, and the wealthy, its leadership and cadre are largely drawn from the refugee camps. — location: [2003](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0095XK8ZU&location=2003) ^ref-53333

With few exceptions, Islamists are in practice strong advocates of capitalism and neoliberalism and therefore cannot offer real solutions to the people who turn to them as a political alternative. — location: [2021](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0095XK8ZU&location=2021) ^ref-9384

any struggle that weakens the Zionist colonial enterprise and by extension the United States—the world’s biggest, best-armed, and most violent imperialist power—is a victory for ordinary people in the region and around the world. — location: [2072](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0095XK8ZU&location=2072) ^ref-8470

One of these shifts is the downplaying of its Islamist ambitions and a corresponding emphasis on its nationalist politics. — location: [2082](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0095XK8ZU&location=2082) ^ref-7196

---
political Islam is the product of specific historic conditions. These conditions include the failure of secular nationalist movements due to their own internal weaknesses; the inability of Stalinist parties to offer an effective alternative; and economic crises in various countries that could not be resolved through state capitalist methods and that neoliberalism exacerbated. — location: [2144](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0095XK8ZU&location=2144) ^ref-1328

This vision of the United States as a unique “beacon for other nations” because of its liberal values is taken for granted within the policy establishment as a whole. — location: [2194](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0095XK8ZU&location=2194) ^ref-26805

The terrorist, Benzion continued, “speaks of ‘humanitarian’ and national causes, he pretends to fight for ‘freedom’ against oppression, he keeps speaking of ‘legitimate rights.’” — location: [2321](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0095XK8ZU&location=2321) ^ref-54155

However, these sentiments did not prevent the Likud party from using the precursor organization to Hamas, the Mujamma, for its own purposes. When the Israeli state recognized and formally licensed the Mujamma in 1978, the logic was simple—the Islamists’ hostility to the secular left made them useful. Some have argued that Israel even funded these forces. — location: [2360](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0095XK8ZU&location=2360) ^ref-4345

The key characteristics of liberal Islamophobia are the rejection of the “clash of civilizations” thesis, the recognition that there are “good Muslims” with whom diplomatic relations can be forged, and a concomitant willingness to work with moderate Islamists. Liberal Islamophobia may be rhetorically gentler than conservative Islamophobia and (as we will see in chapter 10) the language of the “Islamophobic warriors,” but it is nonetheless racist and imperialist in that it takes for granted the “white man’s burden.” — location: [2584](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0095XK8ZU&location=2584) ^ref-18961
