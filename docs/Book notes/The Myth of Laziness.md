## Highlights
Still others may develop signs of output failure as adolescents or as adults despite having created their share of praiseworthy products at an earlier time of life. — location: [192](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FC0S4G&location=192) ^ref-30835

that when a task looks and feels like an enemy attacking you, the job is to disarm the adversary, to make the task easier. — location: [2372](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FC0S4G&location=2372) ^ref-59858

praiseworthy output depends partly on a hefty dose of luck, timing, and opportunity. — location: [2675](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FC0S4G&location=2675) ^ref-32683

---
I’m always amazed by how much we can accomplish when we simply teach children and adults the words for what they need to be working on and then provide practice in applying those words. — location: [2739](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FC0S4G&location=2739) ^ref-57252

---
In the adult business world it is less likely that your assets will be discovered and brought out by another caring adult, so it is up to you to take the initiative. — location: [2832](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FC0S4G&location=2832) ^ref-59791

They are not merely playing a political game, but they do know how to interpret the unspoken ground rules for school achievement. Much the same game is played throughout an adult’s career. — location: [2860](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FC0S4G&location=2860) ^ref-23622

---
I’m astounded at how many people don’t, won’t, or perhaps can’t seem to undertake a thoughtful analysis of what their bosses, their customers, and their unwritten career “guidelines” mandate in the way of output expectations. They need to be made aware of the need to do so in a very conscious, thoughtful manner. Otherwise their productivity may be chronically inadequate, miscalculated, and misdirected. — location: [2869](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FC0S4G&location=2869) ^ref-62435

Parents should take every precaution not to come across as a child’s harshest critic. — location: [3442](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FC0S4G&location=3442) ^ref-39023

---
Such sensible negotiation preserves a high level of accountability and reinforces the critical notion that everybody needs to be productive but not like a swarm of clones or drones. — location: [3571](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FC0S4G&location=3571) ^ref-9953

When a kid (or an adult) is licking the wounds inflicted by her output failure, important people in her life should come to the rescue and provide well-informed, sensitive care. — location: [3573](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FC0S4G&location=3573) ^ref-26268

---
Many low-output individuals have been tattooed with stigmatizing, mostly unhelpful, simplistic, and pessimistic labels, such as ADD, yet have only a vague sense about which breakdown trips them up when they set out to accomplish work. — location: [3608](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FC0S4G&location=3608) ^ref-16721

---
Helping a kid understand and forgive himself through demystification is a significant step in preventing him from plummeting ever deeper into spirals of failure, abysmal self-esteem, and useless suffering. — location: [3612](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FC0S4G&location=3612) ^ref-25625

Kids need targeted help with their underlying neurodevelopmental dysfunctions; otherwise the medication is likely to provide only temporary relief (if any). — location: [3674](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FC0S4G&location=3674) ^ref-31293

---
I suspect we would need to use much less medication if we worked specifically to help people become productive whose depressed feelings were the direct result of their disappointment with themselves. — location: [3686](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FC0S4G&location=3686) ^ref-53513

---
kids who are understood and supported by adults and kids who have the firmest grasp on their own insatiability are most likely to convert this seeming deficit into a major strength. On the other hand, those who grow up hearing nothing but criticism of their ways are more likely to write themselves off and give in to immediate gratification in life. — location: [3867](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FC0S4G&location=3867) ^ref-36765
