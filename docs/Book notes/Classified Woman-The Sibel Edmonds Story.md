Turkish criminal networks consist mainly of respectable-looking businessmen (some of whom are among the top international CEOs), high-ranking military officers, diplomats, politicians and scholars. Their U.S. counterparts are equally respected and recognized: high-level bureaucrats within the State Department and Pentagon, elected officials, or combination of the two, who now have set up their own companies, NGOs and lobbying groups. — location: [1598](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007XY8INW&location=1598) ^ref-27210

While the U.S. government painted Islamic charity organizations as the main financial source for Al Qaeda, they were hard at work covering up the terrorists’ true financial source: narcotics and illegal arms sales. Why? — location: [1612](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007XY8INW&location=1612) ^ref-20186

the existence and survival of many U.S. allies—particularly Turkey, nearly every Central Asian nation, and now Afghanistan—chiefly depend on cultivating, processing, transporting and distributing these illegal substances throughout Western Europe and the United States? And might this illegal production and trafficking allow for the procurement of U.S. weapons and technology, our military-industrial complex’s bread and butter? — location: [1621](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007XY8INW&location=1621) ^ref-44580

one of many sorry points that our response to 9/11 had brought us to: a fear-driven police-like state. — location: [5105](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007XY8INW&location=5105) ^ref-24205

A few brave souls actually slowed down to whisper such things as, “This is disgusting” or “They have no right to treat people like this” or even “This is a shame.” — location: [5144](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007XY8INW&location=5144) ^ref-40291

Far from protecting government whistleblowers as promised, the Obama administration has amassed the worst record in U.S. history for persecuting, prosecuting and jailing government whistleblowers and truth tellers. This president’s Department of Justice has twisted the 1917 Espionage Act to press criminal charges in five instances of alleged national security leaks: more such prosecutions than have occurred in all previous administrations combined, going all the way back to the founders. — location: [5182](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007XY8INW&location=5182) ^ref-62334

President Obama has initiated a covert assassination program as well, allocating to himself the power to include Americans on that list. Indeed, several United States citizens, including their children, have been assassinated abroad. — location: [5195](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007XY8INW&location=5195) ^ref-18147
