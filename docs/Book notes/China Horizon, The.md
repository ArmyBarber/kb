Deng Xiaoping put forward three criteria for assessing the quality of a political system: first, whether the country is politically stable; second, whether the system and policies help to strengthen unity among the people and to raise their living standards (note: Deng placed people’s unity and people’s livelihood together); and third, whether the productivity keeps developing.” — location: [2183](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01GJ4VXS8&location=2183) ^ref-7802
