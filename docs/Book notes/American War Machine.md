Unprosecuted lynchings were the de facto enforcement of illegally segregated Jim Crow society in the American South. Land grabs in the American West were achieved with press-encouraged violence against native Americans, many of them nonviolent, who originally lived there.6 This cultural tolerance of violence and murder spilled over into other aspects of American life, notably union busting. (In the 1914 “Ludlow massacre,” during a mineworkers strike against the Rockefeller-owned Colorado Fuel and Iron Company, only one member of the strikebreakers was convicted, and he was given only a light reprimand. — location: [150](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004GHNHGM&location=150) ^ref-63505

in Burma, Thailand, and Laos between the late 1940s and the 1970s. These countries also only became factors in the international drug traffic as a result of CIA assistance (after the French, in the case of Laos) to what would otherwise have been only local traffickers. — location: [187](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004GHNHGM&location=187) ^ref-35110

What is needed more than a change in Afghanistan or in Pakistan is a change in Washington itself, to cease subsidizing the predators who have been profiting from our discomfort and casualties abroad. It would be nice to think that understanding of this folly would lead to its termination. But what we are witnessing is precisely the progressive erosion of the power of the public state to control the myriad activities that are conducted, in its name, for private profit. Neither the president nor the Congress appears capable of reversing the tide of corruption that is overwhelming both them and us. — location: [4171](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004GHNHGM&location=4171) ^ref-56051

Muhammad Zia ul-Haq’s iron rule against the Pakistani people while using Pakistan as a surrogate in the war against the Soviets in Afghanistan.
