## Highlights
Rather than facing this bitter truth, Muslims, generally, have figured an easy way out: to just disregard the contradictions embedded in their historical narrative. — location: [348](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SXTGV6W&location=348) ^ref-34874

---
There is no good answer to the question as to why Ali was not invited to the Saqifa meeting, especially given that, in the words of Stephen O’Shea, ‘a more qualified candidate to succeed Muhammad was scarcely imaginable’. — location: [1943](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SXTGV6W&location=1943) ^ref-35523

---
‘Quraysh did not want Muhammad’s kin to rule, since they were loath to see prophethood and caliphate combined in a single family, lest they become overbearing.’ — location: [1969](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SXTGV6W&location=1969) ^ref-16615

---
The weak amongst you shall be strong with me until I have secured his rights, if God wills; and the strong amongst you shall be weak with me until I have wrested from him the rights of others, if God wills. — location: [1981](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SXTGV6W&location=1981) ^ref-64654

---
Umar later substantiated this view while explaining the decision taken at Saqifa, calling it ‘Falta – a precipitate and ill-considered deal’, and he believed that only God saved the Muslims from the negative consequences of this slip. — location: [2006](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SXTGV6W&location=2006) ^ref-21295

---
Fatima was known as the ‘mother of her father’ for her immensely caring nature, her protective words, her loyalty and her never-ending love. — location: [2052](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SXTGV6W&location=2052) ^ref-5075

---
while Fatima was going through the trauma of her father’s passing away and later her own illness, it was Abu Bakr’s wife Asma bint Umays who visited her regularly, consoling her and taking care of her. — location: [2071](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SXTGV6W&location=2071) ^ref-21697

---
according to the historian Tabari, Abu Sufyan approached Ali while people were about to pay allegiance to Abu Bakr in the mosque and said, ‘Stretch out your hand so that I may give you the oath of allegiance.’ — location: [2087](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SXTGV6W&location=2087) ^ref-55111

---
I shall resign myself to this situation for as long as the affairs of the Muslims are being soundly governed and for as long as there be no injustice except in relation to me. — location: [2497](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SXTGV6W&location=2497) ^ref-65261

---
Ali had categorically refused to follow the precedents established by both Abu Bakr and Umar as a condition for becoming the caliph, as discussed earlier. — location: [2503](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SXTGV6W&location=2503) ^ref-19634

---
Becoming rich was not un-Islamic, but making a fortune through shady means surely was. — location: [2535](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SXTGV6W&location=2535) ^ref-56020

---
‘While it remains critically fraught to describe anything in the vast Islamic tradition as “universal”, we could confidently present Ali as the figure most universally beloved and revered by Muslims after the Prophet himself.’ — location: [3997](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SXTGV6W&location=3997) ^ref-19338

---
Whether it was in dealings of taxation, property matters or business, Ali provided well-defined instructions on how things should be handled. In practising empathy and acting as the common man, having lived a life of financial hardship himself, he was well acquainted with the troubles ordinary people faced. — location: [4016](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SXTGV6W&location=4016) ^ref-20229

---
Nobody would suffer undue hardship while others lived in luxury, and nobody would be seen as better than another because of financial status. The priority of his rule was the welfare of the people, and this becomes evident to anyone even glancing through his sermons and his letters written to his governors. — location: [4022](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08SXTGV6W&location=4022) ^ref-12650
