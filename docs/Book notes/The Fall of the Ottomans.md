The majority of the world’s 240 million Muslims in 1914 lived under colonial domination, nearly all of them subjects of an Entente Power: 100 million under British rule, 20 million in French colonies, and a further 20 million within the Russian Empire. — location: [1327](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWX7S96&location=1327) ^ref-50356

Halbmondlager (Crescent Moon Camp) at Wünsdorf-Zossen, near Berlin. The camp’s German commanders spoke Arabic with the prisoners. Camp food was fully compliant with Islamic dietary requirements. The camp even had an ornate mosque, paid for by Wilhelm II himself, to provide for the spiritual needs of Muslim POWs—and to prove the kaiser’s good intentions towards the Muslim world. — location: [1710](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWX7S96&location=1710) ^ref-60955

---
Ibn Saud was clearly torn. Given the importance of religion to his own movement, he could not be seen to support the non-Muslim British at the expense of his Arab Muslim brothers in Basra. Yet Ibn Saud was wary of antagonizing the British, given their powerful presence in the Gulf. — location: [1905](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWX7S96&location=1905) ^ref-11920

---
after centuries of Ottoman rule, it was hard to imagine that the Turks would not eventually return. So long as there remained any chance of an Ottoman restoration, the local townspeople would keep their distance from the British for fear of later reprisals. — location: [1963](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWX7S96&location=1963) ^ref-55419

“At 10:45 we again arrived at the railroad pier whereupon the Commander of the British landing party informed the writer that the Captain of the ship had signaled his thanks for having witnessed fairplay, the British stepped into the steamboat, shoved off and the incident was closed.” — location: [2192](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWX7S96&location=2192) ^ref-7554

Perhaps, had they focused their efforts on a single campaign, they might have stood a chance of success. The rush to take on two Great Powers with inadequate preparation condemned both campaigns to catastrophic failure. — location: [2271](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWX7S96&location=2271) ^ref-64290

Eti reported that in every battalion between three and five Armenians were shot daily “by accident” and mused, “If it goes on like that, there won’t be any Armenians left in the battalions in a week.”23 — location: [2403](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWX7S96&location=2403) ^ref-4163

this spontaneous change of plan placed the whole campaign in jeopardy. — location: [2419](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWX7S96&location=2419) ^ref-13347

---
whatever enthusiasm for jihad Muslims in the Russian Empire might have shown in the early stages of the Sarıkamış campaign, the totality of Ottoman defeat ruled out the prospect of an Islamic uprising on the Russian front. — location: [2524](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWX7S96&location=2524) ^ref-38132

Cemal would have only 20,000 to 25,000 Ottoman soldiers with which to take on a dug-in British force at least twice that size—a suicidal proposition. — location: [2544](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWX7S96&location=2544) ^ref-22848

BETWEEN DECEMBER 1914 AND APRIL 1915, THE OTTOMANS TOOK the initiative on three fronts without success. In the Battle of Sarıkamış, the Ottoman Third Army was nearly destroyed, while Cemal Pasha managed to retreat from the first assault on the Suez Canal with nearly all of his Fourth Army intact. Suleyman Askeri’s attempt to regain Basra also ended in failure. These campaigns revealed Ottoman commanders to be unrealistic in their expectations and the average Ottoman soldier to be incredibly tenacious and disciplined under even the most extreme conditions. These battles also revealed the limits of the sultan’s call for jihad. Where Ottoman troops suffered defeats, local Muslims were discouraged from rising against the Entente Powers. By dealing the Ottomans a decisive defeat, the Allies believed they could lay to rest the threat of jihad once and for all. — location: [2775](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWX7S96&location=2775) ^ref-32215

“No opposition,” Colonel Williams recorded optimistically. “We shall land unopposed.” He spoke too soon. Three minutes later, as the tows reached the shore, the disciplined Turkish defenders opened fire. — location: [3147](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWX7S96&location=3147) ^ref-54811

Young Turks faced urgent demands for military resources on several fronts at once—especially in the Caucasus, where Russo-Armenian cooperation threatened the Ottomans in a region of particular vulnerability. In addressing that threat, the Young Turks would resort to means for which they have been accused of crimes against humanity down to the present day. — location: [3342](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PWX7S96&location=3342) ^ref-55775
