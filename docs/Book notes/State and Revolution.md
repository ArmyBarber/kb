## Highlights
The first act by which the state really comes forward as the representative of the whole of society—the taking possession of the means of production in the name of society—is also its last independent act as a state. — location: [267](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07P7GHFVF&location=267) ^ref-23607

---
fact, Engels speaks here of the proletariat revolution “abolishing” the bourgeois state, while the words about the state withering away refer to the remnants of the proletarian state after the socialist revolution. — location: [285](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07P7GHFVF&location=285) ^ref-53208

---
the “special coercive force” for the suppression of the proletariat by the bourgeoisie, of millions of working people by handfuls of the rich, must be replaced by a “special coercive force” for the suppression of the bourgeoisie by the proletariat (the dictatorship of the proletariat). — location: [290](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07P7GHFVF&location=290) ^ref-8111

---
democracy also being a state and, consequently, also disappearing when the state disappears. Revolution alone can “abolish” the bourgeois state. The state in general, i.e., the most complete democracy, can only “wither away”. — location: [300](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07P7GHFVF&location=300) ^ref-50466

---
We are in favor of a democratic republic as the best form of state for the proletariat under capitalism. But we have no right to forget that wage slavery is the lot of the people even in the most democratic bourgeois republic. — location: [315](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07P7GHFVF&location=315) ^ref-10426

---
We have already said above, and shall show more fully later, that the theory of Marx and Engels of the inevitability of a violent revolution refers to the bourgeois state. The latter cannot be superseded by the proletarian state (the dictatorship of the proletariat) through the process of “withering away”, but, as a general rule, only through a violent revolution. — location: [341](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07P7GHFVF&location=341) ^ref-50022

---
this kind of “abolition” of the state that Marx fought in refuting the anarchists! He did not at all oppose the view that the state would disappear when classes disappeared, or that it would be abolished when classes were abolished. What he did oppose was the proposition that the workers should renounce the use of arms, organized violence, that is, the state, which is to serve to “crush the resistance of the bourgeoisie”. — location: [1009](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07P7GHFVF&location=1009) ^ref-43420

---
After overthrowing the yoke of the capitalists, should the workers “lay down their arms”, or use them against the capitalists in order to crush their resistance? But what is the systematic use of arms by one class against another if not a “transient form” of state? — location: [1017](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07P7GHFVF&location=1017) ^ref-33956
