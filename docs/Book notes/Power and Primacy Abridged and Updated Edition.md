## Highlights
Direct European rule and near absolute Western dominance could change only with the end of the West’s longstanding monopoly on modern industrial and military capabilities, which came with the modernization of Japan in the late nineteenth century and the Soviet Union’s rapid Stalinist industrialization program in the 1930s. — location: [121](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QQL3VCL&location=121) ^ref-29885

---
Imperial Japan and the USSR were key to facilitating the independence of numerous Asia-Pacific states – providing arms, ideologies and inspiration, which allowed Asian peoples to challenge the Western empires. — location: [127](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QQL3VCL&location=127) ^ref-1993

---
The example set by Japan’s successes inspired nationalists across the region by demonstrating that the West could be confronted and defeated. — location: [135](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QQL3VCL&location=135) ^ref-32716

---
the United States’ abolition of the People’s Republic of Korea by military decree and imposition of a military government run by leaders hand-picked by the U.S. military itself. — location: [148](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QQL3VCL&location=148) ^ref-59614

---
By 1947 a communist victory, considered near impossible by all major powers in 1945, appeared imminent. — location: [1822](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QQL3VCL&location=1822) ^ref-53409

---
their only major foreign backer had been North Korea – as the Japanese imperial era Korean resistance which had gone on to form the new North Korean leadership had formed close ties with the PLA during their joint struggle for independence. The main contribution the Koreans provided however was manpower, as the small state did not have the funds or the industrial capacity to support the PLA. — location: [1833](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QQL3VCL&location=1833) ^ref-10821

---
Despite their overwhelming material and manpower advantages the Guomindang quickly saw their position deteriorate, leading to their eventual defeat. — location: [1836](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QQL3VCL&location=1836) ^ref-28796

---
The communists were seen to lead by example and took great care to portray themselves to the impoverished population as paragons of honesty, progressiveness and fairness. As a result, the people voted with their support, and not only did the rural populations support the PLA, but disillusioned Guomindang forces transferred entire divisions and their weapons to the PLA through mass defections. — location: [1849](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QQL3VCL&location=1849) ^ref-58506

---
American delegations which had visited Chinese communist territory noted the stark discrepancy with areas under the Guomindang. It was these differences which can be largely credited for the latter’s ultimate defeat. — location: [1859](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QQL3VCL&location=1859) ^ref-17627

---
He observed the lack of censorship which had been prevalent in Guomindang areas, and the sense of freedom in communist areas. ‘To the casual eye there are no police in Yenan,’ he reported of the communist controlled region by contrast to the nationalist police state. ‘Morale is very high … there is no defeatism but rather confidence.’ — location: [1864](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QQL3VCL&location=1864) ^ref-45663

---
Chiang Kai-shek had himself written in his personal diary in late 1948, by which time a communist victory appeared inevitable, that the Guomindang had failed primarily due to the corruption and ‘rot’ within its leadership. — location: [1871](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QQL3VCL&location=1871) ^ref-3758

---
For the United States a dependent client dictatorship, even ‘the world’s worst leadership,’ was far preferable to their interests than to a genuinely independent and popular communist government. — location: [1878](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QQL3VCL&location=1878) ^ref-48507

---
communist victory came as much as a surprise to the Soviet Union as it did to the United States. — location: [1895](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QQL3VCL&location=1895) ^ref-19795

---
Guomindang forces were forced to flee to Taiwan, taking with them numerous national and artistic treasures and the country’s entire gold reserve — location: [1904](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QQL3VCL&location=1904) ^ref-18954

The massacres are estimated to have killed up to 28,000 of Taiwan’s indigenous population. — location: [1907](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QQL3VCL&location=1907) ^ref-47132

---
Taiwan held by a U.S. aligned government the territory would become a key staging ground for the United States to wage a concerted campaign to undermine the Chinese government on the mainland, and would come to host American nuclear weapons and 30,000 military personnel. — location: [1910](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QQL3VCL&location=1910) ^ref-45594

---
The communist victory, in the United States widely termed the ‘Loss of China,’ came as the greatest blow to America’s foreign policy designs in the postwar era. — location: [1915](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QQL3VCL&location=1915) ^ref-60144

Before the communist takeover the United States made their position on Tibet’s autonomy clear: ‘The Government of the United States has borne in mind the fact that the Chinese Government has long claimed sovereignty over Tibet and that the Chinese constitution lists Tibet among areas constituting the territory of the Republic of China — location: [2055](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QQL3VCL&location=2055) ^ref-19106

As the fourteenth Dalai Lama recalled, co-operation with the CIA against China ‘only resulted in more suffering for the people of Tibet.’ — location: [2127](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QQL3VCL&location=2127) ^ref-6058

---
The campaign, while potentially promising and a considerable drain on Chinese resources, ultimately floundered due to lack of support from the vast majority of the Tibetan population. — location: [2130](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QQL3VCL&location=2130) ^ref-10975

---
It is worthy of note that support for separatist movements in China began immediately after China became an independent People’s Republic in 1949 – not before. — location: [2143](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QQL3VCL&location=2143) ^ref-43417

---
West supported Tibetan separatism ‘not because they cared about Tibetan independence, but as part of their worldwide efforts to destabilize all communist governments.’ — location: [2145](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QQL3VCL&location=2145) ^ref-24500

‘human rights’ only become an issue raised against states which pursue independent policy contrary to Western interests, which at the time were mostly communist or communist aligned states. — location: [2147](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QQL3VCL&location=2147) ^ref-57097

---
This combined with threats of nuclear and biological weapons attacks (see Chapter 9), infiltration by saboteurs and hostile paramilitary forces meant that the country was always in a state of war. — location: [2155](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QQL3VCL&location=2155) ^ref-5024

The free and open society and approachable leadership described by political analyst John Service when he led the American delegation to the Chinese communists in 1944 could never last under such circumstances. — location: [2157](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QQL3VCL&location=2157) ^ref-57269

The immense scale of the security threat thus necessitated precautions which compromised the freedom of the Chinese people. — location: [2160](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QQL3VCL&location=2160) ^ref-53384

China under threat could never develop to its full potential, and into the free society which could have been an attractive model to much of Asia, due to the continuing war waged against it. — location: [2163](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QQL3VCL&location=2163) ^ref-63864

---
Without the context of the military incursions and threats as persistent as they were dire which the state faced ever since its formation, as well as the extreme hostility China’s communists faced from the United States during the civil war, the development of Chinese civil society and government can never be properly understood and can be easily misrepresented. — location: [2165](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QQL3VCL&location=2165) ^ref-43758

Essentially, according to U.S. intelligence, the Chinese did not endorse and had little to gain from war – regardless of who started it. — location: [4786](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QQL3VCL&location=4786) ^ref-13314

---
Had China actively sought to fight the United States in Korea they could have easily intervened in the opening months when U.S. forces were on the verge of being driven off the peninsula entirely and any small assistance to the North Koreans could well have tipped the balance. As it was China sought to avoid war at all costs, and did so only when it faced a serious threat and attacks from a relentless hostile force. — location: [5474](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QQL3VCL&location=5474) ^ref-15167

Malaysia was notably an exceptional case, and by refusing to comply with the ‘advice’ of Western financial institutions to restructure and adopt neoliberal policies it was spared the worst of the crisis. — location: [10844](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QQL3VCL&location=10844) ^ref-16991

What was removed was nothing less than the ‘trade and investment protectionism and activist state intervention that were the key ingredients of the “Asian miracle,”’ according to political scientist Professor Walden Bello.43 With their own states unable to intervene in their interests, Asian peoples and economies were left entirely at the mercy of Western institutions. — location: [10884](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QQL3VCL&location=10884) ^ref-55071

Western credibility was torn to shreds when the financial tsunami struck Wall Street [2008].

The Western Bloc, led by the United States, would take extensive measures to counter the threat of an emerging independent Chinese state to their regional dominance. These measures, which commenced in the early 1950s, included a complete trade embargo, deployment of nuclear weapons to Taiwan, South Korea and Japan, and the rapid expansion of air and naval bases in the two countries to further encircle China. — location: [12916](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QQL3VCL&location=12916) ^ref-27285

The construction of airstrips in disputed territories had however first been carried out by Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines on Taiping, Swallow Reef, Spratly island and Thitu respectively.

With China’s rise posing arguably the greatest threat to Western primacy in modern history, surpassing that posed by the Soviet Union, and considering the success of support for Islamist groups in the past and the frequency with which the strategy has been employed, it remains highly likely that this will again be implemented. — location: [14554](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QQL3VCL&location=14554) ^ref-39243
