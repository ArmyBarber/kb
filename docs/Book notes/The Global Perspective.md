## Highlights
What is the principal contradiction in capitalism? It is the contradiction created by imperialism. Not only between imperialist nations and oppressed nations, but also among imperialist nations. — location: [4827](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DTH19H9&location=4827) ^ref-64599

The power relations that must be revolutionized are embedded in everyday relations, in customs, perceptions, attitudes, etc. The revolutionary struggle is a struggle over defining what is true and false, what is good and evil. It is a struggle for the hearts of the people. It happens everywhere and can take many forms. To be revolutionaries, we must acknowledge this and be prepared. — location: [7002](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DTH19H9&location=7002) ^ref-42982

vision. If we want to redeem socialism and turn it into a popular “brand” once again, we must develop concrete and viable ideas about how to govern and produce in a socialist society. We must move from the ideological plane to the practical one. — location: [7058](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DTH19H9&location=7058) ^ref-65462

Globally, short-term politics will be framed by the proletariat of the Global South demanding a bigger piece of the pie, working-class people in the North defending the welfare state, and capital trying to defend its global power. — location: [7069](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DTH19H9&location=7069) ^ref-60018

---
Our short-term political work tends to be mainly defensive. We try to prevent things from getting worse and defend what we have. Our politics become opportunistic and we often choose the lesser of two (or various) evils. — location: [7081](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DTH19H9&location=7081) ^ref-39290

In the Global North, short-term interests are impossible to align with radical politics in the South—not even with viable medium-term strategies in the Global North — location: [7086](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DTH19H9&location=7086) ^ref-55081

There can only be radical change if the relief of immediate problems is tied to medium-term and long-term perspectives. — location: [7096](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DTH19H9&location=7096) ^ref-2753

---
In the Global North, if even 5–10 percent of the population end up working for radical change in the world system, it will make a huge difference for the struggles in the Global South. — location: [7122](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DTH19H9&location=7122) ^ref-46306

We will without doubt become materially poorer. This, however, does not mean that our lives will be poorer. They might quite likely be richer if based on principles other than consumption and growth. — location: [7162](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DTH19H9&location=7162) ^ref-57027

Future anti-imperialist struggles will be, first and foremost, anticapitalist struggles. This will distinguish them from the anti-imperialist struggles of the 1970s, which were, first and foremost, nationalist struggles. — location: [7269](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DTH19H9&location=7269) ^ref-24686
