### Highlight (orange) - Location 16

when Gorbachev  succeeded in eradicating all of Stalin's achievements, crowning thirty-five years of virulent denunciations of \`Stalinism', Lenin  himself became persona non grata in the Soviet Union. With the burial of Stalinism, Leninism  disappeared as well.

### Highlight (blue) - Location 33

\`How can we not support Stalin, who built socialism, who defeated fascism, who incarnated all our hopes?'

Introduction: The importance of Stalin
--------------------------------------

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 50

Gorbachev,  his back to the wall, is seeking increasing political and economic support from the imperialist world. In return, he allows the West to do as it pleases in the Soviet Union.'

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 53

\`Since 1985 Gorbachev  has not firmly and consistenly defended any political position. In waves, the Right has attacked. Each new wave has dragged Gorbachev  further to the Right. Confronted by further attacks by nationalists and fascists, supported by Yeltsin,  it is not impossible that Gorbachev  will again retreat, which will undoubtedly provoke the disintegration of the CPSU and the Soviet Union.'

### Highlight (blue) - Location 68

if there was a failure in the Soviet Union, it was a failure of revisionism, introduced by Khrushchev  thirty-five years ago.

### Highlight (orange) - Location 72

Once Stalin was demolished, Lenin  was liquidated with a flick of the wrist.

### Highlight (pink) - Location 73

the dismantling of Lenin's  statues was not preceded by a political campaign against his work. The campaign against Stalin was sufficient. Once Stalin's ideas were attacked, vilified and destroyed, it became clear that Lenin's  ideas had suffered the same fate.

### Highlight (orange) - Location 77

under the pretext of \`returning to Lenin',  the Tsar returns; under the pretext of \`improving Communism', savage capitalism has erupted.

### Highlight (orange) - Location 86

Instead of \`discovering the truth about Stalin' among those specialists of anti-Communism, wouldn't it have been better to look for the strings of psychological warfare by the CIA?

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 93

The anti-Stalin campaigns conducted by the Western \`democracies' in 1989--1991 were often more violent and more slanderous than those conducted by the Nazis in 1930s:

Stalin is of vital importance in the former socialist countries
---------------------------------------------------------------

### Highlight (orange) - Location 113

all the fanatics of capitalism and of imperialism, to finish off what remained of socialism in the USSR, focused on Stalin as the target.

### Highlight (orange) - Location 121

once Stalin was buried, Hitler  came out of his tomb. And in Russia, Ukraine, Romania, Slovakia, etc., all the fascist heroes are resurrected, ilk such as Vlasov,  Bandera,  Antonescu,  Tiso  and other Nazi collaborators.

Stalin's work is of crucial importance in the Third World
---------------------------------------------------------

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 146

in the most difficult situations, only a firm and inflexible attitude towards the enemy can resolve the fundamental problems of the working masses.

In Communist Parties around the world, the ideological struggle around the Stalin question presents many common characteristics
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 198

Churchill  is probably the only bourgeois politician of this century to have equalled Hitler. 

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 207

A Communist who does not adopt a firm class position with respect to the misleading, one-sided, incomplete or false information that the bourgeoisie spreads around will be lost forever.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 219

all the so-called \`Left critics' of Stalin have jumped onto the anti-Communist bandwagon, just countless cheerleaders.

### Highlight (orange) - Location 221

All these \`Left criticisms' of Stalin had as final consequence the restoration of savage capitalism, the reinstatement of a merciless dictatorship of the bourgeoisie and the destruction of all social gains, cultural and political rights for the working masses and, in many cases, to the emergence of fascism and of reactionary civil wars.

### Highlight (blue) - Location 239

In our judgment of all the episodes during the period 1923--1953, we must struggle to understand completely the political line held by the Bolshevik Party and by Stalin.

Heroism and enthusiasm
----------------------

### Highlight (blue) - Location 933

Ten years later, in 1928, Dr. Dillon  revisited the USSR, and was lost in amazement at what he saw: \`Everywhere people are thinking, working, combining, making scientific discoveries and industrial inventions .... Nothing like it; nothing approaching it in variety, intensity, tenacity of purpose has ever yet been witnessed. Revolutionary endeavour is melting colossal obstacles and fusing heterogeneous elements into one great people;

### Highlight (blue) - Location 937

The Bolsheviks then have accomplished much of what they aimed at, and more than seemed attainable by any human organisation under the adverse conditions with which they had to cope. They have mobilised well over 150,000,000 of listless dead-and-alive human beings, and infused into them a new spirit.'

### Highlight (blue) - Location 976

American industrialization was largely financed by European capital, while the man power for the industrial construction world poured in from China, Ireland, Poland, and other European countries. Soviet industrialization was achieved almost without the aid of foreign capital.'

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 980

The hard life and the sacrifices of industrialization were consciously and enthusiastically accepted by the majority of workers. They had their noses to the grindstone, but they knew that it was for themselves, for a future with dignity and freedom for all workers.

Class war
---------

### Highlight (blue) - Location 998

How did the London and Paris bankers and industries create their industrial base? Could their industrialization have been possible without the pillage of the India?

### Highlight (orange) - Location 999

Pillage accompanied by the extermination of more than sixty million American Indians?

### Highlight (orange) - Location 1001

UNESCO experts estimate the African losses at 210 million persons, killed during raids or on ships, or sold as slaves.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1004

Those who industrialized their countries by chasing peasants off the land with guns, who massacred women and children with working days of fourteen hours, who imposed slave wages, always with the threat of unemployment and famine, they dare go on at book length about the \`forced' industrialization of the Soviet Union?

### Highlight (pink) - Location 1007

If Soviet industrialization could only take place by repressing the rich and reactionary five per cent, capitalist industrialization consisted of the terror exercised by the rich five per cent against the working masses, both in their own countries and in dominated ones.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1017

the ease with which a counter-revolutionary who served in the White Armies but showed himself to be dynamic and intelligent could pass as a proletarian element and climb the ranks of the Party. His work also showed that the majority of active counter-revolutionaries were potential spies for imperialist powers.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1021

solely a \`negative' undertaking, as it is presented in the West: it was mostly a massive political mobilization that reinforced the antifascist conscience of the workers, that made bureaucrats improve the quality of their work and that allowed a considerable development of industrial production.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1031

within a surprisingly short time had changed from the pogrom-inspiring gendarme into a promising trade-union functionary in a large factory. He was ultra-proletarian, worked well, and was not afraid to cut corners and push his way up at the expense of his fellows.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1049

\`Here was a man who was at least a potential menace to the Soviet power, a man who might have been willing to cooperate with the Germans for the \`liberation of the Ukraine' in 1941. He, also, got ten years.'

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1053

Officials and administrators who had formerly come to work at ten, gone home at four-thirty, and shrugged their shoulders at complaints, difficulties, and failures, began to stay at work from dawn till dark, to worry about the success or failure of their units, and to fight in a very real and earnest fashion for plan fulfillment, for economy, and for the well-being of their workers and employees, about whom they had previously lost not a wink of sleep.'

An economic miracle
-------------------

### Highlight (blue) - Location 1078

Lenin  expressed his confidence in the capacity of the Soviet people to build socialism in one country by declaring, \`Communism is Soviet power plus the electrification of the whole country'.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1088

The theory of the \`impossibility of socialism in the USSR', spread by the Mensheviks and the Trotskyists  was a mere lamentation showing the pessimism and the capitulationist spirit among the petite bourgeoisie.

### Highlight (blue) - Location 1097

During industrialization, the main effort was focused on creating the material conditions for freedom and independence for the Socialist homeland. At the same time, the socialist rйgime laid down the basis for future well-being and prosperity.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1099

The greatest part of the increase in national revenue was destined for accumulation. One could hardly think about improving the material standard of living in the short term. Yes, the life for workers and peasants was hard.

### Highlight (blue) - Location 1109

socialist industrialization, which clearly could not take place through the exploitation of colonies, was achieved through the sacrifices of all workers, industrial, peasant and intellectual.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1112

Build housing? The Nazi aggressors destroyed and burnt 1,710 cities and towns and more than 70,000 villages and hamlets, leaving 25 million people without shelter.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1115

In 1921, the Soviet Union was a ruined country, its independence under threat from all the imperialist powers. After twenty years of titanic efforts, the workers built a country that could stand up to the most developed capitalist power in Europe, Hitler's  Germany.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1118

what has been the lot of the ninety per cent of workers in the Third World? And who profited from this suffering? Did the workers in these countries knowingly accept these sacrifices, as was the case in the Soviet Union? And did the sacrifices of the Indian, Brazilian, Nigerian or Egyptian worker allow the creation of an independent economic system, capable of resisting the most vicious imperialism, as did the Soviet worker in the twenties and thirties?

From rebuilding production to social confrontation
--------------------------------------------------

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1140

The socialist revolution had brought great gains to the peasant masses. The peasants without land had received plots.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1142

The peasants kept and consumed a much greater share of their harvests. \`Grain for the towns, the army, industry and export in 1926/27 amounted to only 10 million tons as compared with 18.8 million tons in 1909--13 (average).'

Weakness of the party in the countryside
----------------------------------------

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1153

at the beginning of socialist construction, the Bolshevik Party had little hold on the countryside.

### Highlight (blue) - Location 1168

The soldiers who had served in the Red Army during the Civil War and the 180,000 sons of peasants who, each year, entered the army, where they received a Communist education, were in general supporters of the rйgime.

The character of the Russian peasant
------------------------------------

### Highlight (blue) - Location 1186

He has no meat, no eggs, no butter, no milk, often no cabbage, and lives mainly on black bread and potatoes. Lives? He starves on an insufficient quantity of them.'

New class differentiation
-------------------------

### Highlight (blue) - Location 1199

after the spontaneous evolution of the free market, 7 per cent of peasants, i.e. 2,700,000 peasants, were once again without land. Each year, one quarter of a million poor lost their land. Furthermore, the landless men were no longer accepted in the traditional village commune.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1201

In 1927, there were still 27 million peasants who had neither horse nor cart. These poor peasants formed 35 per cent of the peasant population.

### Highlight (blue) - Location 1206

between 5 and 7 per cent of peasants succeeded in enriching themselves: these were the kulaks.

### Highlight (blue) - Location 1208

3.2 per cent of families had on average 2.3 draft animals and 2.5 cows,

### Highlight (blue) - Location 1209

There was a total of 950,000 families (3.8 per cent) who hired agricultural workers or rented out means of production.

Who controlled the market wheat?
--------------------------------

### Highlight (blue) - Location 1213

Since most of the peasants were no longer exploited by the landowners, they consumed a large part of their wheat. The sales on extra-rural markets were only 73.2 per cent of what they were in 1913.

### Highlight (blue) - Location 1217

72 per cent of the grain had come from large exploitations (landowners and kulaks). In 1926, on the other hand, the poor and middle peasants produced 74 per cent of the market wheat. In fact, they consumed 89 per cent of their production, bringing only 11 per cent to market.

### Highlight (orange) - Location 1220

they sold 47.2 per cent of their production, almost half of their harvest.

### Highlight (orange) - Location 1221

In 1926, the kulaks, a rising force, controlled 20 per cent of the market wheat.

### Highlight (blue) - Location 1223

in the European part of the USSR, the kulaks and the upper part of the middle peasants, i.e. about 10 to 11 per cent of families, made 56 per cent of the sales in 1927--1928.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1225

In 1927, the balance of forces between the socialist economy and the capitalist economy could be summed up as follows: collectivized agriculture brought 0.57 million tonnes of wheat to market, the kulaks 2.13 million.

Towards confrontation
---------------------

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1236

since there was a lack of light machinery products, the better-off peasants refused to sell their wheat. The State was forced to capitulate, abandoning its plans for grain exports, reducing industrial equipment imports and reducing industrial credit.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1244

Private merchants, who still controlled half the meat sold in the city, blatantly enriched themselves. The Soviet Union was once again threatened with war, after London's decision to break diplomatic ties with Moscow.

Bukharin's position
-------------------

### Highlight (blue) - Location 1262

In 1927, the countryside saw a poor harvest. The amount of grain sold to the cities dropped dramatically. The kulaks, who had reinforced their position, hoarded their wheat to speculate on shortages so that they could force a significant price hike. Bukharin  thought that the official buying prices should be raised and that industrialization should be slowed down. According to Davies,  \`Nearly all of the non-party economists supported these conclusions'.

Betting on the kolkhoz ...
--------------------------

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1273

\`Where is the way out? The way out is in the passing of small disintegrated peasant farms into large-scaled amalgamated farms, on the basis of communal tillage of the soil; in passing to collective tillage of the soil on the basis of the new higher technique.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1278

it was decided to focus on the political line of limiting the exploiting tendencies of the rural bourgeoisie. The government imposed new taxes on the revenues of the kulaks. The latter had to meet higher quotas during grain collection.

... or betting on the individual peasant?
-----------------------------------------

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1283

In 1928, as in 1927, the grain harvest was 3.5 to 4.5 million tonnes less than in 1926, due to very bad climatic conditions. In January 1928, the Politburo unanimously decided to take exceptional measures, by seizing wheat from the kulaks and the well-to-do peasants, to avoid famine in the cities.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1309

Bukharin  was already following a social-democratic policy of \`class peace' and was blind to the relentless struggle of the kulaks to oppose collectivization by all means. He saw the \`weaknesses' of the Party and State apparatuses as the reason for the class war, without understanding that they were heavily infiltrated and influenced by the kulaks.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1316

we are facing a class enemy that is attacking us, that refuses to give its wheat

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1316

surplus for the socialist industrialization and that declares: give me a tractor, give me electoral rights, and then you will get wheat.'

The first wave of collectivization
----------------------------------

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1320

the final struggle against the last capitalist class in the Soviet Union, the kulaks, the agrarian bourgeoisie.

The kulak
---------

### Highlight (orange) - Location 1329

\`The distinctive characteristic of this class ... is the hard, unflinching cruelty of a thoroughly educated man who has made his way from poverty to wealth, and has come to consider money-making, by whatever means, as the only pursuit to which a rational being should devote himself.'

### Highlight (orange) - Location 1333

\`And of all the human monsters I have ever met in my travels, I cannot recall so malignant and odious as the Russian kulak.'

The kolkhozy surpass the kulaks
-------------------------------

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1336

If the kulaks, who represented already 5 per cent of the peasantry, had succeeded in extending their economic base and definitively imposing themselves as the dominant force in the countryside, the socialist power in the cities would not have been able to maintain itself, faced with this encirclement by bourgeois forces.

### Highlight (blue) - Location 1351

During 1929, collectivized agriculture produced 2.2 million tonnes of market wheat, as much as the kulaks did two years previously. Stalin foresaw that during the course of the next year, it would bring 6.6 million tonnes to the cities.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1353

\`Now we are able to carry on a determined offensive against the kulaks, to break their resistance, to eliminate them as a class and substitute for their output the output of the collective farms and state farms.'

A fiery mass movement
---------------------

### Highlight (blue) - Location 1370

On January 1, 1930, 18.1 per cent of the peasant families were members of a kolkhoz. A month later, they accounted for 31.7 per cent.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1372

\`Collectivization quickly assumed a dynamic of its own, achieved largely as a result of the initiative of rural cadres. The center was in peril of losing control of the campaign'.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1379

\`If the centre intended to include 15 per cent of households, the region raised the plan to 25 per cent, the okrug to 40 per cent and the district posed itself the task of reaching 60 per cent'.

The war against the kulak
-------------------------

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1385

This frenetic race towards collectivization was accompanied by a \`dekulakization' movement: kulaks were expropriated, sometimes exiled. What was happening was a new step in the fierce battle between poor peasants and rich peasants.

### Highlight (orange) - Location 1393

\`The working masses in the countryside have been exploited for centuries. Now, after a chain of bloody defeats beginning with the peasant uprisings of the Middle Ages, their powerful movement for the first time in human history has a chance of victory.'

The essential rфle of the most oppressed masses
-----------------------------------------------

### Highlight (blue) - Location 1399

The essential impulse during the violent episodes of collectivization came from the most oppressed of the peasant masses.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1401

The October revolution gave me land, I got credit from year to year, I got a poor horse, I can't work the land, my children are ragged and hungry, I simply can't manage to improve my farm in spite of the help of the Soviet authorities. I think there's only one way out: join a tractor column, back it up and get it going.'

### Highlight (blue) - Location 1405

collectivization became, to a great extent, a series of ad hoc policy responses to the unbridled initiatives of regional and district rural party and government organs.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1407

Collectivization and collective farming were shaped less by Stalin and the central authorities than by the undisciplined and irresponsible activity of rural officials, the experimentation of collective farm leaders left to fend for themselves, and the realities of a backward countryside.'

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1411

The Party set the general direction, and, on this basis, the base and the intermediate cadres were allowed to experiment. The results from the base would then serve for the elaboration of new directives, corrections and rectifications.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1414

\`The state ruled by circular, it ruled by decree, but it had

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1414

neither the organizational infrastructure nor the manpower to enforce its voice or to ensure correct implementation of its policy in the administration of the countryside

### Highlight (orange) - Location 1415

The roots of the Stalin system in the countryside do not lie in the expansion of state controls but in the very absence of such controls and of an orderly system of administration, which, in turn, resulted as the primary instrument of rule in the countryside.'

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1421

In 1929--1933, the Soviet State did not have the technical means, the required qualified personnel, nor the sufficient Communist leadership to direct collectivization in a planned and orderly manner: to describe it as an all-powerful and totalitarian State is absurd.

### Highlight (orange) - Location 1423

In the countryside, the essential urge for collectivization came from the most oppressed peasants.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1426

The primary instrument was mobilization, consciousness raising, education and organization of the masses of peasants. This constructive work, of course, required \`repression', i.e. it took place and could not have taken place except through bitter class struggle against the men and the habits of the old rйgime.

### Highlight (orange) - Location 1430

To apply its revolutionary line, the Bolshevik leadership often called on the revolutionary forces at the base to short-circuit parts of the bureaucratic apparatus.

The organizational line on collectivization
-------------------------------------------

### Highlight (orange) - Location 1436

How did Stalin and the leadership of the Bolshevik Party react to the spontaneous and violent collectivization and \`dekulakization' tide? They basically tried to lead, discipline and rectify the existing movement, both politically and practically.

The Party apparatus in the countryside
--------------------------------------

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1444

The weakness of the Communist apparatus was one of the conditions that allowed the kulaks to throw all their forces into a vicious battle against the new society.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1445

On January 1, 1930, there were 339,000 Communists among a rural population of about 120 million people!

### Highlight (blue) - Location 1458

Kaganovich  pointed out that \`if we formulate it sharply and strongly, in essence we have to create a party organization in the countryside, capable of managing the great movement for collectivization'.

Extraordinary organizational measures
-------------------------------------

### Highlight (orange) - Location 1478

A firm warning was given that \`administrative compulsion must not be used to get the middle peasants to join the kolhoz'.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1482

During the first few weeks of 1930, Ukraine organized 3,977 short courses for 275,000 peasants. In the fall of 1929, thirty thousand activists were trained on Sundays, during their time off, by the Red Army, which took on another contingent of 100,000 people during the first months of 1930.

### Highlight (blue) - Location 1484

the Red Army trained a large number of tractor drivers, agricultural specialists and cinema and radio operators.

The 25,000 against the bureaucracy
----------------------------------

### Highlight (blue) - Location 1506

Upon arrival, the 25,000 immediately had to fight against the bureaucracy of the local apparatus and against the excesses committed during the collectivization.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1508

\`Regardless of their position, the 25,000ers were unanimous in their criticism of district-level organs participating in collectivization .... The workers claimed that it was the district organs which were responsible for the race for percentages in collectivization.'

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1511

no preparatory work had been done among the peasants. Consequently, they were not prepared for collectivization.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1520

By opposing the bureaucrats and their excesses, they succeeded in winning the confidence of the peasant masses.

### Highlight (pink) - Location 1523

It was precisely the \`Stalinists' who fought bureaucracy and excesses most consistently and who defended a correct line for collectivization.

The 25,000 and the organization of agricultural production
----------------------------------------------------------

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1534

The poor peasants, on the frontline for collectivization, did not have the slightest idea about the organization of collective production. They hated their exploitation and, for that reason, were solid allies of the working class. But as individual producers, they could not create a new mode of production: this is one of the reasons that the dictatorship of the proletariat was necessary.

### Highlight (pink) - Location 1547

The contribution of the 25,000 to collectivization was enormous. During the twenties, \`Poverty, illiteracy and a chronic predisposition to periodic famine characterized much of the rural landscape'.

### Highlight (orange) - Location 1551

\`(A) new system of agricultural production was indeed established, and this, although not without its problems, did end the periodic crises which characterized earlier market relations between the cities and the countryside'.

The political direction of collectivization
-------------------------------------------

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1556

vivid and prolonged discussions took place within the Party about the speed and scale of collectivization.

Kulak rumors and indoctrination
-------------------------------

### Highlight (blue) - Location 1690

the kulak's most powerful weapon, also the most difficult to confront, was rumor and indoctrination.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1695

All sorts of other terrifying \`information' was heard. In the kolkhozy, a special machine would burn the old so that they would not eat any more wheat. Children would be taken away from their parents and sent to crиches. Four thousand women would be sent to China to pay for the Chinese Eastern Railway.

Struggle to the end
-------------------

### Highlight (blue) - Location 1742

After this resolution, which announced the end of capitalist relations in the countryside, the kulaks threw themselves into a struggle to the end. To sabotage collectivization, they burnt crops, set barns, houses and other buildings on fire and killed militant Bolsheviks.

### Highlight (orange) - Location 1746

All the work on the land was done with draft animals. The kulaks killed half of them. Rather than cede their cattle to the collectives, they butchered them and incited the middle peasants to do the same.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1748

Of the 34 million horses in the country in 1928, there remained only 15 million in 1932. A terse Bolshevik spoke of the liquidation of the horses as a class. Of the 70.5 million head of cattle, there only remained 40.7 million in 1932. Only 11.6 million pigs out of 26 million survived the collectivization period.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1752

This destruction of the productive forces had, of course, disastrous consequences: in 1932, there was a great famine, caused in part by the sabotage and destruction done by the kulaks. But anti-Communists blame Stalin and the \`forced collectivization' for the deaths caused by the criminal actions of the kulaks.

The resolution on dekulakization
--------------------------------

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1781

The majority of kulaks were probably \`reliable in their attitude to Soviet power'. They numbered between 396,000 and 852,000 households. Only part of the means of production were confiscated and they were installed in new land within the administrative district.

Right opportunism rears its head
--------------------------------

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1895

In a rural world dominated by small producers, Stalin's criticism of such blatant errors was clearly dangerous. Enthusiasm easily transformed itself into defeatism,

### Highlight (pink) - Location 1896

right opportunism, always present, reared its head when leftist errors were criticized.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1900

Some, afraid of the bitterness and the violence of the class struggle in the countryside, took advantage of the criticism of the excesses of collectivization to start criticizing, once again, the very concept of collectivization.

The anti-Communists attack
--------------------------

### Highlight (blue) - Location 1911

All the anti-Party and counter-revolutionary elements tried to change the criticism of the excesses into a criticism of Stalin and the Party leadership.

### Highlight (orange) - Location 1928

Trotsky's  \`leftist' criticisms were no longer distinguishable from those of the right opportunists.

Retreats and advances
---------------------

### Highlight (blue) - Location 1948

With the great collectivization wave, the kolkhozy consisted mainly of landless and poor peasants. However, a large number of middle peasants had joined. In May, 32.7 per cent of the leading members were former middle peasants.

Remarkable results
------------------

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1954

Remarkable results Despite the major upheavals provoked by collectivization, the 1930 harvest was excellent.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 1960

In 1930, the entire collective sector (kolkhozy, sovkhozy and individual plots of kolkhozians) generated 28.4 per cent of the gross agricultural production, compared to 7.6 per cent the previous year.

### Highlight (orange) - Location 1973

the entire working population made enormous sacrifices to build socialism and to industrialize, and the sacrifices asked of the workers were often greater than the sacrifices asked of the peasants.

### Highlight (blue) - Location 1978

the prices received by the agricultural producer increased far more rapidly than the prices of industrial goods. The terms of trade turned in favour of agriculture.'

Economic and social creativity
------------------------------

### Highlight (blue) - Location 2010

Most of the basic traits of the socialist agricultural system were \`invented' during the 1929--1931 struggle. Davies  recognized this:

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 2020

The kolkhozians received compensation, thanks to the considerable revenue generated by sale on the free market and by supplementary work.

### Highlight (blue) - Location 2046

As early as spring 1930, this system showed its superiority. The TMS only served 8 per cent of the kolkhozy, but 62 per cent of the peasants in those kolkhozy remained during the \`retreat'.

### Highlight (orange) - Location 2060

Finally, a balance was found between collective labor and the individual activity of the kolkhozian peasants. The legal status of the kolkhozy, made official on February 7, 1935, fixed the basic principles, defined through five years of struggle and experience.

The breakthrough of socialist agriculture
-----------------------------------------

### Highlight (orange) - Location 2088

Starting in 1933, agricultural production rose most years.

In 1931 and 1932, the Soviet Union was in the depth of the crisis, due to socio-economic upheavals, to desperate kulak resistance, to the little support that could be given to peasants in these crucial years of industrial investment, to the slow introduction of machines and to drought. Grain production fell to 69.5 and to 69.9 million tonnes. Then, there were three successive harvests from 1933 to 1935 of 89.8, 89.4 and 90.1 million tonnes.

### Highlight (blue) - Location 2092

bad climactic conditions produced the worst harvest, in 1936, of 69.3 million tonnes, but its effects were mitigated by reserves and good planning of distribution.

### Highlight (blue) - Location 2096

Socialist agriculture dramatically rose as soon as the considerable industrial and agricultural investments had an effect. The total value of agricultural production stagnated between 1928 and 1934, oscillating between 13.1 billion rubles and 14.7 billion rubles. Then it rose to 16.2 billion in 1935, to 20.1 billion in 1937, and 23.2 billion in 1940.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 2099

A peasant population rising from 120.7 to 132 million people between 1926 and 1940 was able to feed an urban population that increased from 26.3 to 61 million in the same period.

\`Colossal support'

The development of a rural bourgeoisie in a country where 80 per cent of the population still lived in the countryside would have asphyxiated and killed Soviet socialism. The collectivization prevented that from happening.

\`(T)he overwhelming majority of peasants were very attached to the new system of exploitation. The proof came during the war, since in the regions occupied by the German troops, despite the efforts made by the Nazi authorities, the kolkhozian form of exploitation was maintained.'

The causes of famine in the Ukraine
-----------------------------------

### Highlight (orange) - Location 2556

The 1932-1933 Ukrainian famine had four causes.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 2560

\`Their \[kulak\] opposition took the initial form of slaughtering their cattle and horses in preference to having them collectivized. The result was a grievous blow to Soviet agriculture, for most of the cattle and horses were owned by the kulaks. Between 1928 and 1933 the number of horses in the USSR declined from almost 30,000,000 to less than 15,000,000; of horned cattle from 70,000,000 (including 31,000,0000 cows) to 38,000,000 (including 20,000,000 cows); of sheep and goats from 147,000,000 to 50,000,000; and of hogs from 20,000,000 to 12,000,000. Soviet rural economy had not recovered from this staggering loss by 1941.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 2577

The catastrophe of 1932 was the hardest blow that Soviet Ukraine had to face since the famine of 1921--1922. The autumn and spring sowing campaigns both failed. Whole tracts were left unsown, in addition when the crop was being gathered ... in many areas, especially in the south, 20, 40 and even 50 per cent was left in the fields, and was either not collected at all or was ruined in the threshing.'

### Highlight (blue) - Location 2581

The second cause of the famine was the drought that hit certain areas of Ukraine in 1930, 1931 and 1932.

### Highlight (blue) - Location 2589

The third cause of the famine was a typhoid epidemic that ravaged Ukraine and North Caucausus.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 2596

\`the peak of the typhus epidemic coincided with the famine .... it is not possible to separate which of the two causes was more important in causing casualties.'

### Highlight (blue) - Location 2598

The fourth cause of the famine was the inevitable disorder provoked by the reorganization of agriculture and the equally profound upheaval in economic and social relations: lack of experience, improvization and confusion in orders, lack of preparation and leftist radicalism among some of the poorer peasants and some of the civil servants.

### Highlight (orange) - Location 2603

The figure of one to two million should also be compared to the nine million dead caused by the 1921--1922 famine, essentially provoked by the military intervention of eight imperialist powers and by the support that they gave to reactionary armed groups.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 2605

The famine did not last beyond the period prior to the 1933 harvest.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 2617

\`In 1933 rainfall was adequate. The Party sent its best cadres to help organize work in the kolkhozes. They succeeded; after the harvest of 1933 the situation improved radically and with amazing speed.

\`This disproves the \`\`fact'' of anti-Ukrainian genocide parallel to Hitler's anti-semitic holocaust. To anyone familiar with the Soviet Union's desperate manpower shortage in those years, the notion that its leaders would deliberately reduce that scarce resource is absurd ....'

The struggle against bureaucracy

once the Second World War had begun, Trotsky  spent his time provoking the Soviet people in \`acting against the Stalinist bureaucracy as it did previously against the Tsarist bureaucracy and the bourgeoisie.'

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 2661

throughout the thirties, the Party leaders, principally Stalin, Kirov  and Zhdanov,  devoted a lot of energy to the struggle against the bureaucratic elements within the Party and State apparatus.

Anti-Communists against \`bureaucracy'

Lenin  vehemently dealt with counter-revolutionaries attacking the so-called \`bureaucracy' to overthrow the socialist rйgime.

Bolsheviks against bureaucratization

### Highlight (blue) - Location 2691

Among this mass, many were in fact political illiterates. They had revolutionary sentiments, but no real Communist knowledge. Kulaks, old Tsarist officers and other reactionaries easily succeeded in infiltrating the Party. All those who had a certain capacity for organization were automatically accepted into the Party, as there were so few cadres.

Rittersporn  is saying: Look, I can prove that most of the current ideas about Stalin are absolutely false. But to say this requires a giant hurdle. If you state, even timidly, certain undeniable truths about the Soviet Union in the thirties, you are immediately labeled \`Stalinist'. Bourgeois propaganda has spread a false but very powerful image of Stalin, an image that is almost impossible to correct, since emotions run so high as soon as the subject is broached.

Stalin was not only careful and patient in the struggle, he even allowed opponents who claimed that they had understood their errors to return to the leadership. Stalin really believed in the honesty of the self-criticisms presented by his former opponents.

------------------------------------

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 3189

Trotsky  led a relentless struggle from 1922 to 1927 within the leadership of the Party, claiming that it was impossible to build socialism in one country, the Soviet Union. But, this unscrupulous individual declared in 1934 that socialism was so solidly established in the Soviet Union that overthrowing it would claim tens of millions of lives!

### Highlight (blue) - Location 3192

Trotsky  claimed to defend the \`Old Bolsheviks'. But the \`Old Bolsheviks' Zinoviev  and Kamenev  were diametrically opposed to the \`Old Bolsheviks' Stalin, Kirov,  Molotov,  Kaganovich  and Zhdanov. 

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 3203

Trotsky  claimed that counter-revolution was impossible without a bloodbath that would cost tens of million lives. He pretended that capitalism could not be retored \`from inside', by the internal political degeneration of the Party, by enemy infiltration, by bureaucratization, by the social-democratization of the Party. However, Lenin  insisted on this possibility.

### Highlight (yellow) - Location 3211

Just as a clandestine organization succeeded in killing the number two of the socialist rйgime, Trotsky  declared that the dictatorship of the proletariat should logically begin to disappear.

This is the fable that has been repeated by Nazi and other fascist criminals of all countries: when the German fascists were on the verge of defeat, they all discovered their \`national and independent' vocation and remembered their \`opposition' to Germany, looking for protection under the wings of U.S. imperialism!

Defeatism and capitulation in front of Nazi Germany
---------------------------------------------------

### Highlight (blue) - Location 4748

Trotskyist  propaganda had two effects. It encouraged defeatism and capitulationism, through the idea that fascism was assured victory given that the USSR had such a rotten and incompetent leadership. It also encouraged \`insurrections' and assassination attempts to eliminate Bolshevik leaders \`who would betray in difficult times'. A leadership that was categorically destined to fall during the war might well fall at the beginning of the war. Anti-Soviet and opportunistic groups could therefore make their attempts.
