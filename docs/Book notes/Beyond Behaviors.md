## Highlights
many problematic behaviors reflect how the child’s brain and body perceive stress. — location: [208](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QFFQXVM&location=208) ^ref-53122

---
It takes effort, but it’s important to discover which settings work best for each child, developing an appreciation for his or her individual differences. — location: [319](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QFFQXVM&location=319) ^ref-13551

---
We can’t simply ask a child to calm down and use her words unless the child has the developmental capacity to do so. — location: [362](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QFFQXVM&location=362) ^ref-8880

---
toddlers don’t start developing these abilities until age three and a half or four at the earliest. — location: [371](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QFFQXVM&location=371) ^ref-31547

---
Teaching is great when a child is neurodevelopmentally ready to be taught, but the foundation for helping children is built through the experience of love, safety, and connection in relationships. Emotional co-regulation with caring adults leads to successful self-regulation. — location: [384](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QFFQXVM&location=384) ^ref-56423

---
Many children have behaviors, including different ways they move their bodies in order to concentrate or feel comfortable, that teachers or parents target for change because these adults view the behaviors from a deficit-based rather than a strength-based perspective. — location: [402](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QFFQXVM&location=402) ^ref-6399

---
Sometimes a person’s body and brain detect threat when the person is actually safe, or alternatively, detects safety when actually at risk. — location: [462](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QFFQXVM&location=462) ^ref-48485

---
A child who seems to be misbehaving is, in the process, adapting and surviving. Instead of viewing behaviors purely as difficulties we need to get rid of, it’s helpful to see them as forming an instructional manual for how to support each child’s nervous system. — location: [531](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QFFQXVM&location=531) ^ref-13239
