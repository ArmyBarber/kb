## Highlights

Success depends in large part on a proper mind-set: focusing on the results you plan to achieve, rather than the number of hours you work. The results are what matter most to your employer, clients, and colleagues. — location: [63](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007HBLNSS&location=63) ^ref-22752
