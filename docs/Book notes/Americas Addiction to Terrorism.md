for the first time in history half of U.S. public schoolchildren live in poverty.1 The U.S. Department of Education reported in 2013 that there were 1.3 million homeless children enrolled in U.S. schools, up 85 percent since 2008; and the organization Feeding America has estimated that 16 million U.S. children, or 21.6 percent, live without food security. — location: [1192](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B013K9GRTA&location=1192) ^ref-4214
