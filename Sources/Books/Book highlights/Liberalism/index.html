<p>On the other hand, however, disdaining the half-measures and timidity or fear of those who restricted themselves to accepting it as a necessary ‘evil’, Calhoun declared slavery to be ‘a positive good’ that civilization could not possibly renounce. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=74">74</a> ^ref-61772</p>

<p>Locke was ‘the last major philosopher to seek a justification for absolute and perpetual slavery’. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=111">111</a> ^ref-46904</p>

<p>female slaves. When one of the latter died, following a mysterious pregnancy and subsequent abortion, he recorded in his diary the painful financial loss suffered: ‘fully one thousand dollars—the hard labor of a year’. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=129">129</a> ^ref-49022</p>
<hr/>
<p>while evincing unease at hereditary, racial slavery, demanded a sort of penal slavery for those who, regardless of their skin colour, were guilty of vagrancy. Was Hutcheson a liberal? — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=158">158</a> ^ref-33666</p>
<hr/>
<p>In Mill’s view, ‘any means’ were licit for those who took on the task of educating ‘savage tribes’; ‘slavery’ was sometimes a mandatory stage for inducing them to work and making them useful to civilization and progress — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=185">185</a> ^ref-34982</p>
<hr/>
<p>Is demanding ‘absolute obedience’, for an indeterminate period of time, from the overwhelming majority of humanity compatible with the liberal profession of faith? Or is it synonymous with ‘soi-disant’ liberalism? — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=192">192</a> ^ref-41093</p>
<hr/>
<p>In polemicizing against one another, the two branches the liberal party had divided into adopted the ideology and rhetoric that had presided over the self-celebration of the English nation in its entirety, as the sworn enemy of political slavery. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=241">241</a> ^ref-51024</p>
<hr/>
<p>You Americans make a great Clamour upon every little imaginary infringement of what you take to be your Liberties; and yet there are no People upon Earth such Enemies to Liberty, such absolute Tyrants, where you have the Opportunity, as you yourselves are. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=250">250</a> ^ref-57689</p>
<hr/>
<p>The self-styled champions of liberty branded taxation imposed without their explicit consent as synonymous with despotism and slavery. But they had no scruples about exercising the most absolute and arbitrary power over their slaves. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=252">252</a> ^ref-15522</p>
<hr/>
<p>‘the most clamorous advocates for liberty were uniformly the harshest and worst masters of slaves’. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=259">259</a> ^ref-46063</p>
<hr/>
<p>It affords a curious spectacle to observe, that the same people who talk in a high strain of political liberty, and who consider the privilege of imposing their own taxes as one of the inalienable rights of mankind, should make no scruple of reducing a great proportion of their fellow-creatures into circumstances by which they are not only deprived of property, but almost of every species of right. Fortune perhaps never produced a situation more calculated to ridicule a liberal hypothesis, — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=263">263</a> ^ref-49233</p>

<p>to a ‘free government’ controlled by slaveowners, he preferred a ‘despotic government’ capable of erasing the infamy of slavery, he made explicit reference to America. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=269">269</a> ^ref-21894</p>
<hr/>
<p>The accused reacted in their turn by upbraiding England for its hypocrisy: it boasted of its virtue and love of liberty, but who promoted and continued to promote the slave trade? And who was it that transported and sold slaves? — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=277">277</a> ^ref-57906</p>
<hr/>
<p>Virginia played a central role in the American Revolution. Forty per cent of the country’s slaves were to be found there, — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=289">289</a> ^ref-17511</p>
<hr/>
<p>dull as all men are from slavery, must they not a little suspect the offer of freedom from that very nation which has sold them to their present masters?’ — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=302">302</a> ^ref-41030</p>
<hr/>
<p>first, Joshua Gee, acknowledged that ‘[a]ll this great increase in our treasure proceeds chiefly from the labour of negroes in the plantations’. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=318">318</a> ^ref-44973</p>
<hr/>
<p>‘The Negroe Trade and the natural Consequences resulting from it, may be justly esteemed an inexhaustible Fund of Wealth and Naval Power to this Nation’; they were ‘the first principle and foundation of all the rest, the main spring of the machine which sets every wheel in motion’. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=321">321</a> ^ref-22411</p>
<hr/>
<p>The exchange of accusations between rebel colonists and the mother country—that is, between two branches of the party that had hitherto proudly celebrated itself as the party of liberty—was a mutual, pitiless demystification. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=327">327</a> ^ref-26109</p>
<hr/>
<p>‘We … the boasted Patrons of Liberty, and the professed Advocates for the natural Rights of Mankind, engage deeper in this murderous inhuman Traffic than any Nation whatever.’ — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=335">335</a> ^ref-61511</p>
<hr/>
<p>‘the Advocates for Republicanism, and for the supposed Equality of Mankind, ought to have been foremost in suggesting some such humane System for abolishing the worst of all the Species of Slavery’. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=337">337</a> ^ref-63743</p>

<p>‘a bourgeois oligarchy that had broken decisively with the aristocratic landholding ethos’ was dominant. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=350">350</a> ^ref-34496</p>

<p>these enlightened, tolerant, liberal bourgeois who embarked on colonial expansion; and in this historical period the slave trade was an integral part of it: — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=352">352</a> ^ref-7137</p>
<hr/>
<p>Until the mid-seventeenth century, the country where the prologue to the successive liberal revolutions occurred—namely, Holland—had a ‘hold’ on the trade in slaves: — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=362">362</a> ^ref-44713</p>
<hr/>
<p>The first country to embark on the liberal road is one that exhibited an especially tenacious attachment to the institution of slavery. It appears that colonists of Dutch origin offered the most determined resistance to the first abolitionist measures, — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=377">377</a> ^ref-61669</p>
<hr/>
<p>As regards Holland itself, in 1791 the States-General formally declared that the slave trade was essential to the development of the colonies’ prosperity and commerce. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=380">380</a> ^ref-36132</p>
<hr/>
<p>Holland only abolished slavery in its colonies in 1863, when the secessionist and slaveholding Confederacy of the southern United States was going down to defeat. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=383">383</a> ^ref-24041</p>
<hr/>
<p>they appealed to Locke, for whom (as we shall see) the natives of the New World approximated to ‘wild beasts’. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=388">388</a> ^ref-6906</p>

<p>it was precisely the now victorious colonists who ‘were preparing to cut the throats of the Indians’. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=424">424</a> ^ref-65096</p>
<hr/>
<p>the Puritans had initiated a massacre of the Indians, assimilated to ‘Canaanites and Amalekites’—that is, stocks marked out by the Old Testament for erasure from the face of the earth. This was ‘one of the darkest pages in English colonial history’, which was followed by the even more repugnant one written during the American Revolution, — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=429">429</a> ^ref-24943</p>

<hr/>
<p>There is no doubt that, along with black enslavement and the black slave trade, the rise of the two liberal countries either side of the Atlantic involved a process of systematic expropriation and practical genocide first of the Irish and then of the Indians. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=450">450</a> ^ref-19049</p>
<hr/>
<p>Banjuwangi, a province of Java, numbered over 80,000 inhabitants in 1750 and only 18,000 in 1811. That is peaceful commerce! — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=460">460</a> ^ref-56023</p>

<p>processes of enslavement and practical genocide were closely intertwined. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=462">462</a> ^ref-6679</p>

<p>Liberal Holland immediately engaged in overseas expansion and slave-trading, — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=473">473</a> ^ref-12508</p>

<p>the liberal English philosopher was concerned with the white colonists’ expansionist march as secretary (in 1673–74) of the Council of Trade and Plantations. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=525">525</a> ^ref-48327</p>
<hr/>
<p>When he sought to challenge the march of civilization, violently opposing exploitation through labour of the uncultivated land occupied by him, the Indian, along with any other criminal, could be equated with ‘one of those wild savage beasts with whom men can have no society nor security’, and who ‘therefore may be destroyed as a lion or a tiger’. Locke never tired of insisting on the right possessed by any man to destroy those reduced to the level of ‘beasts of prey’, ‘savage beasts’; to the level of ‘a savage ravenous beast that is dangerous to his being’. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=539">539</a> ^ref-50692</p>

<p>although regarded as legitimate in all three cases, the institution of slavery was theorized and affirmed without the least reticence solely by the Dutch author, whose life straddled the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In Locke, by contrast, at least in the case of the Two Treatises of Government, which were written and published on the eve and at the end of the Glorious Revolution, legitimation of slavery tends to occur exclusively between the lines of the discourse celebrating English liberty.

On the basis of this absolute and immutable pre-eminence, we see an exclusive elite—the restricted community of the free—explicitly formulate the claim, hitherto unknown and unheard of, to exercise a planetary dictatorship over the rest of humanity. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=7473">7473</a> ^ref-59430</p>
<hr/>
<p>the self-critical thinking and awareness of limits that had characterized the pre-eminent voices of European and Western culture tended to disappear. The inheritors of that tradition were French radicalism, and then Marx. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=7540">7540</a> ^ref-21884</p>
<hr/>
<p>the Glorious Revolution emerged as ‘a parliamentary coup d’état for [the] transformation of [communal property] into private property’. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=7553">7553</a> ^ref-41913</p>
<hr/>
<p>the advent of constitutional monarchy in England was a further intensification of the dictatorship exercised by English property-owners over Ireland. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=7563">7563</a> ^ref-19442</p>
<hr/>
<p>The process we are examining was the autonomization of the property of those who already enjoyed recognition, of those who aspired to form themselves into the community or caste of freemen. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=7581">7581</a> ^ref-59872</p>
<hr/>
<p>In the England that emerged from the Glorious Revolution, the landed aristocracy consolidated its enjoyment of certain privileges (hunting, for example) and consecrated its political power in representative bodies—in the first instance, the House of Lords. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=7583">7583</a> ^ref-19126</p>
<hr/>
<p>the property barrier proved much weaker because the race barrier was much more rigid. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=7596">7596</a> ^ref-59051</p>
<hr/>
<p>in the United States democracy emerged first because it emerged as a Herrenvolk democracy, as a ‘master-race democracy’, and this specific form proved so tenacious that it survived the Civil War by many decades. It is highly problematic to regard Herrenvolk democracy as complete political emancipation. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=7597">7597</a> ^ref-40139</p>
<hr/>
<p>Was political emancipation more advanced in the North American republic, which saw slavery flourish in these years and which a little earlier had extended that institution to the Texas taken from Mexico? Or was political emancipation more advanced precisely in Mexico and those Latin American countries that had abolished the institution of slavery some decades before? — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=7600">7600</a> ^ref-59720</p>
<hr/>
<p>We cannot even unreservedly endorse Marx’s thesis that ‘[p]olitical emancipation is certainly a big step forward.’83 We already know that the most tragic chapter in the history of the Indians began with the American Revolution, and that the period between the Glorious Revolution and the American Revolution witnessed the emergence of a racial chattel slavery of unprecedented harshness. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=7605">7605</a> ^ref-13265</p>
<hr/>
<p>The model proposed here is different. It equates ‘political revolution’ qua ‘revolution of civil society’, referred to by Marx, with the liberal revolution in the strict sense. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=7615">7615</a> ^ref-17493</p>
<hr/>
<p>If we regard the country born from the War of Independence against England and long led by slave-owners as liberal, it is hard to see why such recognition should be denied to the Confederacy. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=7625">7625</a> ^ref-12461</p>
<hr/>
<p>The principle of racial equality became a constitutive element in liberal identity only from the mid-twentieth century onwards. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=7632">7632</a> ^ref-18219</p>
<hr/>
<p>a benevolent attitude towards the fascist coup d’état is not explicable solely by the severe social and political crisis of the time. Instead, at issue was cancelling, or more or less drastically reducing, the democratic concessions won from liberal society by the popular movement. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=7817">7817</a> ^ref-23470</p>

<p>it could now indeed be said that ‘the white savages of Europe are overrunning the dark savages everywhere’. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=7940">7940</a> ^ref-52976</p>

<p>76 No less brutal than extra-legal violence was official justice: in the South blacks continued to be subject to a prison system so sadistic that it calls to mind ‘the prison camps of Nazi Germany’. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=8040">8040</a> ^ref-40882</p>
<hr/>
<p>‘the Nazi definition of a Jew was never as stringent as “the one-drop rule” that prevailed in the categorization of Negroes in the race-purity laws of the American South.’ — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=8047">8047</a> ^ref-20616</p>

<p>Having disappeared together with Hitler’s Germany, eugenic measures continued to survive for some time in the United States. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=8053">8053</a> ^ref-23956</p>

<hr/>
<p>Jefferson raised the spectre of genocide in three very different contexts. He referred to ‘extermination’ in connection with the Indians as a process that was underway in the United States, could not be stopped, and was in fact to be attributed exclusively to the British. He pointed to the ‘extermination’ of the blacks as the inevitable outcome of the utopia of constructing a multiracial society. Finally, he experienced the clash with Britain as a total war, destined to issue in the ‘extermination’ of one of the contending parties — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=8082">8082</a> ^ref-27184</p>
<hr/>
<p>even a conflict completely internal to the community of the free provoked an ideological violence that might well bring to mind the twentieth century. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=8087">8087</a> ^ref-50511</p>
<hr/>
<p>we certainly must bid farewell once and for all to the myth of the gradual, peaceful transition, on the basis of purely internal motivations and impulses, from liberalism to democracy, or from general enjoyment of negative liberty to an ever wider recognition of political rights. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=8093">8093</a> ^ref-25352</p>
<hr/>
<p>the exclusion clauses were not overcome painlessly, but through violent upheavals of a sometimes quite unprecedented violence. The abolition of slavery in the wake of the Civil War cost the United States more victims than both world wars combined. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=8101">8101</a> ^ref-8631</p>
<hr/>
<p>in addition to not being painless, the historical process that resulted in the advent of democracy was quite the reverse of unilinear. Emancipation—that is, the acquisition of rights previously not recognized or enjoyed—might well be followed by dis-emancipation—that is, deprivation of the rights whose recognition and enjoyment the excluded had won. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=8105">8105</a> ^ref-45487</p>
<hr/>
<p>This phase of dis-emancipation, which developed in a society that continued to define itself as liberal, lasted almost a century. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=8114">8114</a> ^ref-54673</p>
<hr/>
<p>The process of emancipation very often had a spur completely external to the liberal world. The abolition of slavery in British colonies cannot be understood without the black revolution in San Domingo, which was viewed with horror, and often combated, by the liberal world as a whole. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=8115">8115</a> ^ref-33176</p>
<hr/>
<p>‘Racial discrimination furnishes grist for the Communist propaganda mills, and it raises doubt even among friendly nations as to the intensity of our devotion to the democratic faith.’ — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=8121">8121</a> ^ref-64368</p>
<hr/>
<p>first slavery and then the terrorist regime of white supremacy were thrown into crisis by the San Domingo revolt and the October Revolution, respectively. The implementation of an essential principle, if not of liberalism then of liberal democracy (in the usual sense of the term), is inconceivable without the decisive contribution of two of the chapters of history most hated by the liberal culture of the time. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=8126">8126</a> ^ref-14752</p>
<hr/>
<p>Demonstrating an extraordinary flexibility, it constantly sought to react and rise to the challenges of the time. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=8141">8141</a> ^ref-59296</p>
<hr/>
<p>Liberalism has proved capable of learning from its antagonist (the tradition of thinking that, starting with ‘radicalism’ and passing through Marx, issued in the revolutions which variously invoked him) to a far greater extent than its antagonist has proved capable of learning from it. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=8143">8143</a> ^ref-991</p>
<hr/>
<p>this limitation of power went hand in hand with the delimitation of a restricted sacred space: nurturing a proud, exclusivist self-consciousness, the community of the freemen inhabiting it was led to regard enslavement, or more or less explicit subjection, imposed on the great mass dispersed throughout the profane space, as legitimate. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=8148">8148</a> ^ref-5832</p>
<hr/>
<p>for centuries the liberal market was a site of exclusion, de-humanization and even terror. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=8156">8156</a> ^ref-53360</p>
<hr/>
<p>In extreme cases the superstitious cult of the Market sealed huge tragedies, like the one which in 1847 saw Britain condemn an enormous mass of actual (Irish) individuals to death from starvation. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=8162">8162</a> ^ref-9138</p>
<hr/>
<p>the alleged spontaneous capacity for self-correction often attributed to it. If one starts out from such a presupposition, the tragedy of peoples subjected to slavery or semi-slavery, or deported, decimated and destroyed, becomes utterly inexplicable. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=8169">8169</a> ^ref-21309</p>
<hr/>
<p>the habitual hagiography is also an insult to the memory of the victims. Only in opposition to the pervasive repressions and transfigurations is the book now ending presented as a ‘counter-history’: bidding farewell to hagiography is the precondition for landing on the firm ground of history. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EGMBK0C&amp;location=8172">8172</a> ^ref-62247</p>
