<p>time, the incontestable fact remains that most people in Britain did not enthusiastically engage in wage labor—at least so long as they had an alternative. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=188">188</a> ^ref-37135</p>
<hr/>
<p>the dispossession of the majority of small-scale producers and the construction of laissez-faire are closely connected, so much so that Marx, or at least his translators, labeled this expropriation of the masses as “primitive accumulation.” — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=192">192</a> ^ref-1086</p>
<hr/>
<p>the underlying development strategy of the classical political economists was consistent with a crude proto-Marxian model of primitive accumulation, which concluded that nonmarket forces might be required to speed up the process of capitalist assimilation in the countryside. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=205">205</a> ^ref-53407</p>
<hr/>
<p>classical political economy advocated restricting the viability of traditional occupations in the countryside to coerce people to work for wages. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=212">212</a> ^ref-43100</p>
<hr/>
<p>Even though the new institutionalist school concerns itself with the social division of labor, its theories are of no use in analyzing the coercive nature of primitive accumulation, since this school sees the economy arranging itself through voluntary contracts. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=229">229</a> ^ref-39464</p>
<hr/>
<p>The classical political economists were unwilling to trust market forces to determine the social division of labor because they found the tenacity of traditional rural producers to be distasteful. Rather than contending that market forces should determine the fate of these small-scale producers, classical political economy called for state interventions of one sort or another to hobble these — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=236">236</a> ^ref-28072</p>
<hr/>
<p>If efficiency were of great importance to them, the classical political economists would not have ignored the law permitting the gentry to ride across small farmers’ fields in pursuit of foxes while forbidding the farmers from ridding their land of game that might eat the crops. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=241">241</a> ^ref-56651</p>

<hr/>
<p>The subject typically cropped up when they were acknowledging that the market seemed incapable of engaging the rural population fast enough to suit them—or more to the point, that people were resisting wage labor. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=261">261</a> ^ref-20299</p>
<hr/>
<p>Just as a psychologist might detect a crucial revelation in a seemingly offhand remark of a patient, from time to time classical political economy discloses to us insights into its program that the classical political economists would not consciously welcome. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=265">265</a> ^ref-11388</p>

<p>All too often, seemingly open-minded reviews of the past are merely a means to justify preexisting views of the present. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=276">276</a> ^ref-47264</p>
<hr/>
<p>In the early stages of the development of a technology, seemingly trivial accidents can determine which of several technological paths is chosen. Once industry becomes locked into a particular technological standard, it may continue to follow that line of development even though hindsight shows that the neglected paths might have been superior — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=292">292</a> ^ref-52331</p>
<hr/>
<p>Smith’s Wealth of Nations, as we shall see, was not a particularly influential book until a generation after its publication. Once opinion leaders found the book useful in promoting their desired political outcomes, its popularity soared. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=304">304</a> ^ref-64190</p>
<hr/>
<p>Adam Smith becomes less original. His importance appears to emanate from the vigor of his ideological project of advocating laissez-faire and obfuscating all information that might cast doubt on his ideology. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=312">312</a> ^ref-45742</p>
<hr/>
<p>Edward Gibbon Wakefield and John Rae, took a more realistic view about the nature of accumulation, but later economists set their analyses aside to create the impression of a humanitarian heritage of political economy. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=314">314</a> ^ref-27420</p>

<p>Steuart. According to Smithian theory, the social division of labor would evolve in a satisfactory manner without recourse to outside intervention. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=325">325</a> ^ref-30948</p>
<hr/>
<p>even Smith’s celebrated discussion of the invisible hand was developed as a means of avoiding the challenge that primitive accumulation posed for his system. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=326">326</a> ^ref-64384</p>
<hr/>
<p>Smith himself advocated practices that were not in accordance with his theory. This chapter also indicates that Smith was far more interested in changing human behavior than he was with matters of economic development. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=329">329</a> ^ref-65142</p>
<hr/>
<p>despite the adherence to the doctrine of laissezfaire in theory, classical political economists maintained a strong interest in promoting policies that furthered primitive accumulation. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=342">342</a> ^ref-37555</p>
<hr/>
<p>classical political economy conforms to a consistent pattern of almost always supporting positions that would work to harness small-scale agricultural producers to the interests of capital. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=372">372</a> ^ref-6542</p>

<p>Indeed, the history of the recruitment of labor is an uninterrupted story of coercion either through the brute force of poverty or more direct regulation, — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=431">431</a> ^ref-27089</p>
<hr/>
<p>The disorienting introduction of the individualistic ways of the market cut people off from their traditional networks and created a sense of dehumanization — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=434">434</a> ^ref-19801</p>
<hr/>
<p>Employers were quick to perceive the relationship between poverty and the chance to earn handsome profits. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=441">441</a> ^ref-46375</p>
<hr/>
<p>classical political economists joined in the chorus of those condemning the sloth and indolence of the poor. Although they applauded the leisure activities of the rich, they denounced all behavior on the part of the less fortunate that did not yield a maximum of work effort. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=446">446</a> ^ref-19663</p>

<p>In the utopia of early classical political economy, the poor would work every waking hour. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=498">498</a> ^ref-11418</p>

<hr/>
<p>No source of labor was to be overlooked. For example, in a movement that Foucault has termed “the great confinement,” institutions were founded to take charge indiscriminately of the sick, criminal, and poor (Foucault — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=510">510</a> ^ref-7789</p>

<hr/>
<p>if social life [a term that Say used almost like the social division of labor] were a galley, in which after rowing with all their strength for sixteen hours out of the twenty-four, they might indeed be excused for disliking social life…. I maintain no other doctrine when I say that the utility of productions is no longer worth the productive services, at the rate at which we are compelled to pay for them. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=519">519</a> ^ref-13943</p>
<hr/>
<p>Classical political economy frequently couched its recommendations in a rhetoric of individual liberty, but its conception of liberty was far from all-encompassing. Liberty, for capital, depended on the hard work of common people. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=523">523</a> ^ref-30448</p>

<hr/>
<p>he was intent on subordinating all aspects of life to the interests of accumulation. Bentham limited his passionate concern with laissez-faire to those who conformed to the norms of a capitalist society; a jarring confrontation with state power was to be the lot of the rest. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=538">538</a> ^ref-16943</p>

<p>According to classical political economy, all social conditions and all social institutions were to be judged merely on the basis of their effect on the production of wealth. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=566">566</a> ^ref-60334</p>

<p>Bentham was not the least concerned with furthering the bounds of human freedom, but with ensuring that the inmates would have as many offspring as possible — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=570">570</a> ^ref-43090</p>

<p>Poverty is that state and condition in society where the individual has no surplus labour in store, or, in other words, no property or means of subsistence but what is derived from the constant exercise of industry in the various occupations of life. Poverty is therefore a most necessary and indispensable ingredient in society, without which nations and communities could not exist in a state of civilization. It is the lot of man. It is the source of wealth, since without poverty, there could be no labour; there could be no riches, no refinement, no comfort, and no benefit to those who may be possessed of wealth. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=585">585</a> ^ref-40202</p>

<p>the attitude toward household production depends on the stage of capitalist development. At a time when self-provisioning was a serious barrier to the extension of the capitalist mode of production, classical political economy expressed an unremitting hostility toward conditions that would support the working-class household’s ability to provide for itself. Once political economy became confident that the household economy was sufficiently hobbled that its role as a producer would be subordinated to capitalist commodity production, economists seemed to lose all interest in the evolution of the social division of labor. Instead, they exhorted households to become more efficient producers of labor power. Finally, after problems of effective demand gained more prominence, economists treated the household as a locus of consumption. As a result, the role of the household as a site of production generally fell into oblivion. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=1658">1658</a> ^ref-52453</p>

<p>division of time between the production of necessities in the household and the production of necessities while working for wages is the only variable in the system. Why would the capitalists be concerned about the division of the working day between household labor, or self-provisioning, and wage labor? After all, the amount of luxuries is identical in either case. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=1761">1761</a> ^ref-38291</p>

<p>Now let us change the conditions so that households work two and a half hours on their own account. Households now need only half as much in wages to maintain their standard of living because of what they produce on their own account. Nonetheless, the amount of time devoted to luxuries does not decline, however. Consequently, for each hour spent working for wages, the household sector receives a payment equivalent to only one-third of an hour of labor. As a result, the rate of exploitation jumps to 300 percent. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=1772">1772</a> ^ref-40291</p>

<p>Since capitalism had not developed technologies that were superior to the traditional methods of production, the creation of surplus value depended on capital’s success in creating absolute surplus value by lengthening the working day.

<p>Whereas most observers were reluctant to move against the peasant society too quickly because of its ability to produce inexpensive foot soldiers (see Marx 1977, 880–81n; Smith 1976, V.I.a.6, 692–93; Weulersse 1910, 1:246), Petty insisted that England’s military future lay with a strong navy rather than an infantry. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=2485">2485</a> ^ref-5996</p>

<p>The Physiocratic identification of surplus and rent reflected the prevailing opinion within the French middle classes, as well as Cantillon’s theory. At the time, the French bourgeoisie was incapable of imagining any other source of wealth and power than landed property (Nallet and Servolin 1978).

<hr/>
<p>Although almost everybody in polite society agreed that the French peasants were lazy (Weulersse 1910, 1:321), the Physiocrats did not adopt an ostensibly hostile attitude toward them. Unlike the British, whose typical tone was contentious at best when discussing the common people, the French often expressed concern about the well-being of country folk. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=2625">2625</a> ^ref-4314</p>

<p>To begin with, much of the improved economy of labor was not at all due to the production of more output with a lesser quantity of labor.

<p>Thus, although in the long run, a far-reaching expansion of the productive powers of labor accompanied the new agricultural technology, the major attraction at the time appeared to be the reduction in the expense of maintaining labor over the extensive periods that rural workers had previously devoted to household production. Workers, who had formerly divided their hours between the production of grain and the production of their other domestic needs, were now required to more or less specialize in grain. As a result, the net product would increase, since fewer workers would be required on the farm to perform those tasks specifically directed to the production of grains — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=2658">2658</a> ^ref-22465</p>

<p>True, market forces could eventually lead to a more elaborate social division of labor. A decline in self-sufficiency could create a home market for mass-consumption goods; yet such a home market begins from a very small base and could not reach a substantial size overnight.

<p>The mercantile school, in particular, did not care to wait for the natural maturation of a home market, preferring to tap the riches of world markets as soon as possible.

Once he has gone that far, he can simply slide into the technical advantages of the division of labor. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=6483">6483</a> ^ref-16510</p>

<p>Wakefield was easily able to recognize that where small, self-contained households predominated, leisure would take precedence over production. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=6504">6504</a> ^ref-31772</p>
<hr/>
<p>Wakefield’s importance did not depend on his analytical gifts, but rather on his ability, generally, to keep from getting confused by the ideology around him, including his own. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=6509">6509</a> ^ref-21466</p>

<p>We might note that Smith himself recommended taxes on alcohol (Smith 1976, V.ii.k.7); however, we have already seen that the people who invoke the authority of Smith are often more extreme than the great master. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=6548">6548</a> ^ref-9707</p>

<p>“it will not pay.” In all these cases, and a thousand others that ought to be put, the answer is abundantly sufficient as regards the individual, but is no answer at all as regards the society. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=6557">6557</a> ^ref-20012</p>

<p>Rae fell from favor because he, like Steuart, advocated state action to further economic development. Consequently, like Steuart, he was slighted. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=6724">6724</a> ^ref-17953</p>

<p>all three saw much that classical political economy preferred to obscure. They brought the subject of primitive accumulation to the fore. All three were rewarded with silence. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=6737">6737</a> ^ref-29534</p>

<p>Consequently, in the agrarian question and the agrarian crisis the heart of the matter is not simply the removal of obstacles to the advance of agricultural technique, but what way these obstacles are to be removed, what class is to effect this removal and by what methods.—V. I. Lenin, The Agrarian Question in Russia at the End of the Nineteenth Century — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=6740">6740</a> ^ref-58366</p>

<p>Lenin had an eye for the positive developments in the countryside, but without Smith’s blind spot for the harsher aspects of rural development. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=6778">6778</a> ^ref-21583</p>

<p>“The rapid development of commodity economy and capitalism in the post-Reform epoch has caused a rise in the level of requirements of the peasantry.” — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=6780">6780</a> ^ref-33975</p>

<p>Lenin, like Smith, welcomed the potential of such capitalist development to eliminate dependency, — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=6782">6782</a> ^ref-36220</p>

<p>The Russian economy suffered from the usual symptoms of a dualistic economic growth pattern. The Narodniks preferred to avoid the costs associated with capitalist development in Russia by building socialism on the basis of the traditional village economy. Lenin denounced their plans. The peasant’s life was a constant round of toil. Maxim Gorky (1922, 370), the novelist, conveyed the sense of the Russian village in the following words: “The technically primitive labour of the countryside is incredibly heavy, the peasantry call it strada from the Russian verb ‘stradat’—to suffer.” — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=6814">6814</a> ^ref-49780</p>
<hr/>
<p>like Smith, Lenin insisted that no external measures were needed to separate households from their means of production. If the peasantry were to gain access to the land, “it will not abolish capitalism; on the contrary it will create a broader foundation for its development, and will hasten and intensify purely capitalist development” — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=6852">6852</a> ^ref-46215</p>

<p>“in America, it was not the slave economy of the big landlords that served as the basis of capitalist agriculture, but the free economy of the free farmer working on free land, free from all medieval fetters, free from serfdom and feudalism.” — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=6856">6856</a> ^ref-31846</p>

<p>“the essence of the agrarian question and of the agrarian crisis is not the removal of the obstacles to raise agriculture to a higher level, but how these obstacles are to be removed, which class is to remove them and by what means.” — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=6877">6877</a> ^ref-51739</p>
<hr/>
<p>Lenin (1918, 377) also judged the American path to be “the most democratic … [and to cause] the masses less suffering.” Moreover, the American path was the most congenial to capitalist development (see also Lenin 1907, 238–42; 1908, 40–42). Lenin (1974, 91) contended that the American path “would inevitably withdraw the majority of these owners, whose position is hopeless in capitalist society from agriculture, and no ‘right to the land’ would be powerful enough to prevent this.” — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=6879">6879</a> ^ref-56381</p>

<p>Lenin may have underestimated the importance of slavery to the U.S. economy, his imagery of the U.S. path was consistent with the experience of history. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=6885">6885</a> ^ref-4602</p>

<p>Indeed, Marx’s socialism may be said to be the proper heir to the best of classical political economy in this regard. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=7023">7023</a> ^ref-32072</p>

<p>Yet hidden within the works of classical political economy was the uncomfortable truth that capital would profit by attacking the ability of people to provide for themselves. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=7046">7046</a> ^ref-60341</p>

<p>that primitive accumulation was a crucial force in the process of capitalist development—not just during a precapitalist past or even some imagined moment when feudal society suddenly became capitalist. Rather, primitive accumulation played a continuing role as part of capitalist development. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=7054">7054</a> ^ref-14226</p>

<p>Adam Smith becomes less original.

<p>Small-scale production has its own economies, its own efficiencies.

<p>classical political economy was originally written to aid capital in the exploitation of labor, it may, nonetheless, prove to be a crucial source of inspiration. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00EDIWR9M&amp;location=7080">7080</a> ^ref-36081</p>
