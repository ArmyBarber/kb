<p>spite of the unprecedented statement by the G8 scientists ahead of next month’s Gleneagles summit—George W. Bush, the US president, insists we still do not know enough about this literally world-changing phenomenon.” Washington then “succeeded in removing language calling for prompt action to control global warming” and eliminating such inflammatory statements as “Our world is warming,” because “Mr. Bush has said global warming is too uncertain a matter to justify anything more than voluntary measures.” — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B000Q9IU7U&amp;location=330">330</a> ^ref-7734</p>

<p>Between 1980 and 2003, there were 315 suicide attacks worldwide, initially for the most part by the secular Tamil Tigers.

<p>Sheikh Tantawi of Al-Azhar, “one of the first Muslim scholars to condemn Al Qaeda [and] often criticized by ultraconservative clerics as a pro-Western reformer . . . ruled that efforts to stop the American invasion are a ‘binding Islamic duty.’” — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B000Q9IU7U&amp;location=437">437</a> ^ref-823</p>

<p>Seeking to provoke Iraq into some action that could be portrayed as a casus belli, London and Washington renewed their bombing of Iraqi targets in May 2002, with a sharp increase in September 2002. In the nine months leading up to the official start of the war in March 2003, US and UK planes flew almost 22,000 sorties, hitting 391 “carefully selected targets,” — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B000Q9IU7U&amp;location=506">506</a> ^ref-3637</p>

<p>Psychological warfare specialists in the Eisenhower administration advised that the United States should “covertly stimulate acts and attitudes of [defiance] short of mass rebellion aimed at . . . provoking open Soviet intervention in both the GDR [East Germany] and the other satellites,” — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B000Q9IU7U&amp;location=522">522</a> ^ref-6041</p>

<p>It is possible that current US military actions across Syria’s borders are likewise designed to provoke some pretext for attack on the one Arab state that is currently defying Washington’s orders. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B000Q9IU7U&amp;location=530">530</a> ^ref-61520</p>

<p>These sites had been secured by UN inspectors, but the invaders dismissed them, leaving the sites unguarded.

<hr/>
<p>The official justification for the invasion was to prevent the use of WMDs that did not exist. The invasion provided the terrorists who had been mobilized by the United States and its allies with the means to develop WMDs—namely, equipment that the United States and others had provided to Saddam Hussein, — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B000Q9IU7U&amp;location=554">554</a> ^ref-44322</p>

<p>The invasion of Iraq is perhaps the most glaring example of the low priority assigned by Washington planners to the threat of terror, but there are numerous others. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B000Q9IU7U&amp;location=568">568</a> ^ref-53577</p>

<hr/>
<p>Dora María Téllez, the heroine of the popular struggle that overthrew the vicious Somoza regime in Nicaragua, was denied a visa to teach at the Harvard Divinity School.

<p>Fortunately, Western commentators are saved from the unambiguous conclusion, thanks to our self-exemption from the most elementary of moral principles, the principle of universality. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B000Q9IU7U&amp;location=675">675</a> ^ref-45432</p>
<hr/>
<p>It is a rational calculation, on the assumption that human survival is not particularly significant in comparison with short-term power and wealth. And that is nothing new. These themes resonate through history.

<hr/>
<p>The crucial issue throughout the post-World War II period, however, has been control, more so than access or profit. And that concern for “critical leverage” in world affairs will presumably remain true for the foreseeable future. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B000Q9IU7U&amp;location=716">716</a> ^ref-9872</p>
<hr/>
<p>AMONG THE MOST salient properties of failed states is that they do not protect their citizens from violence—and perhaps even destruction— or that decision makers regard such concerns as lower in priority than the short-term power and wealth of the state’s dominant sectors. Another characteristic of failed states is that they are “outlaw states,” whose leaderships dismiss international law and treaties with contempt. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B000Q9IU7U&amp;location=718">718</a> ^ref-31745</p>
<hr/>
<p>The attack began with a bombing campaign intended to drive out all but the adult male population; men ages fifteen to forty-five who attempted to flee Falluja were turned back. The plans resembled the preliminary stage of the Srebrenica massacre, though the Serb attackers trucked women and children out of the city instead of bombing them out. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B000Q9IU7U&amp;location=851">851</a> ^ref-62916</p>

<p>Thus the front page of the world’s leading newspaper was cheerfully depicting war crimes for which the political leadership could be sentenced to severe penalties under US law, the death penalty if patients ripped from their beds and manacled on the floor happened to die as a result. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B000Q9IU7U&amp;location=881">881</a> ^ref-62105</p>
<hr/>
<p>The new constitution, the Wall Street Journal notes, has “far deeper Islamic underpinnings than Iraq’s last one, a half century ago, which was based on [secular] French civil law,” and had granted women “nearly equal rights” with men. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B000Q9IU7U&amp;location=945">945</a> ^ref-47362</p>

<p>The conclusions of the study, carried out on rather conservative assumptions, are that “the death toll associated with the invasion and occupation of Iraq is probably about 100,000 people, and may be much higher.” — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B000Q9IU7U&amp;location=956">956</a> ^ref-30133</p>

<p>The relatively high nutritional levels of Iraqis in the 1970s and 1980s, even through the war with Iran, began to decline severely during the decade of the sanctions, with a further disastrous decline after the 2003 invasion. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B000Q9IU7U&amp;location=986">986</a> ^ref-49574</p>

<p>The authors of the study comment that it is as if college students in Germany estimated Holocaust deaths at 300,000, in which case we might conclude that there are some problems in Germany—and if Germany ruled the world, some rather more serious problems. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B000Q9IU7U&amp;location=1003">1003</a> ^ref-47230</p>

<p>It is an interesting comment on the prevailing moral-intellectual culture that unsupported slander of opponents who are unidentified is considered legitimate practice, particularly among those who modestly describe themselves as “the decent left”—indeed highly meritorious, as long as the conclusions come out the right way. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B000Q9IU7U&amp;location=1019">1019</a> ^ref-32433</p>

<p>Bretton Woods rules also restricted financial speculation and attacks on currencies. The effect was to allow a form of “embedded liberalism,” as it is sometimes called, in which social democratic policies could be pursued. The outcome is often termed the “golden age” of capitalism (more accurately, state capitalism), with unprecedented economic growth that was also egalitarian, and enactment of significant welfare-state measures to benefit the general population. All of this has been reversed in the neoliberal period. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B000Q9IU7U&amp;location=3926">3926</a> ^ref-10331</p>
