<p>What lured Europeans to leave their homes and cross the Atlantic was the chance to share in conquering Indian land. At that time there was a crisis in England over land ownership and tenancy due to the rise of capitalism. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00N980EQK&amp;location=185">185</a> ^ref-25586</p>
<hr/>
<p>The coming of capitalism had smashed all the traditional securities and values of feudal England, and financed its beginnings with the most savage reduction of the general living standard. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00N980EQK&amp;location=198">198</a> ^ref-20435</p>
<hr/>
<p>the ultimate economic objective of colonial workmen was security through agriculture rather than industry … As soon as a workman had accumulated a small amount of money he could, and in many cases did, take up a tract of land and settle on it as a farmer.” — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00N980EQK&amp;location=219">219</a> ^ref-36025</p>
<hr/>
<p>this lie is precisely the same lie put forward by the white “Afrikaner” settlers, who claim that South Africa was literally totally uninhabited by any Afrikans when they arrived from Europe. To universal derision, these European settlers claim to be the only rightful, historic inhabitants of South Afrika. Or we can hear similar defenses put forward by the European settlers of Israel, who claim that much of the Palestinian land and buildings they occupy are rightfully theirs, since the Arabs allegedly decided to voluntarily abandon it all during the 1948–49 war. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00N980EQK&amp;location=249">249</a> ^ref-9021</p>

<p>Spanish “reduced” the Indian population of their colonies from some 50 million to only 4 million by the end of the 17th century. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00N980EQK&amp;location=266">266</a> ^ref-52863</p>
<hr/>
<p>It was the unpaid, expropriated labor of millions of Indian and Afrikan captive slaves that created the surpluses on which the settler economy floated and Atlantic trade flourished. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00N980EQK&amp;location=331">331</a> ^ref-5552</p>
<hr/>
<p>While the cream of the profits went to the planter and merchant capitalists, the entire settler economy was raised up on a foundation of slave labor, slave products, and the slave trade. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00N980EQK&amp;location=338">338</a> ^ref-61795</p>

<hr/>
<p>The colonized Afrikan nation, much more than the new Euro-Amerikan settler nation, was a complete nation — that is, possessing among its people a complete range of applied sciences, practical crafts, and productive labor. Both that colonized nation and the Indian nations were self-sufficient and economically whole, while the Euro-Amerikan invasion society was parasitic. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00N980EQK&amp;location=351">351</a> ^ref-13746</p>
<hr/>
<p>Afrikans were the landless, propertyless, permanent workers of the U.S. Empire. They were not just slaves — the Afrikan nation as a whole served as a proletariat for the Euro-Amerikan oppressor nation. This Afrikan colony supported on its shoulders the building of a Euro-Amerikan society more “prosperous,” more “egalitarian,” and yes, more “democratic” than any in semi-feudal Old Europe. The Jeffersonian vision of Amerika as a pastoral European democracy was rooted in the national life of small, independent white landowners. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00N980EQK&amp;location=369">369</a> ^ref-47103</p>

<p>Every European who wanted to could own land. Every white settler could be a property owner. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00N980EQK&amp;location=385">385</a> ^ref-6627</p>

<p>“Every man in this colony has land, and none but Negroes are laborers.” — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00N980EQK&amp;location=395">395</a> ^ref-49164</p>
<hr/>
<p>In the early decades of Virginia’s tobacco industry, gangs of white indentured servants worked the fields side-by-side with Afrikan and Indian slaves, whom in the 1600s they greatly outnumbered. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00N980EQK&amp;location=456">456</a> ^ref-32235</p>
<hr/>
<p>even the very lowest layer of white society was lifted out of the proletariat by the privileges of belonging to the oppressor nation. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00N980EQK&amp;location=467">467</a> ^ref-62935</p>
<hr/>
<p>the material basis for the lack of class consciousness by early Euro-Amerikan workers, and how their political consciousness was directly related to how much they shared in the privileges of the larger settler society. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00N980EQK&amp;location=469">469</a> ^ref-25007</p>
<hr/>
<p>capitalists proved to their satisfaction that dissent and rebelliousness within the settler ranks could be quelled by increasing the colonial exploitation of other nations and peoples. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00N980EQK&amp;location=471">471</a> ^ref-61991</p>
<hr/>
<p>No one, we note, has yet summoned up the audacity to maintain that the Indians too wished to fight and die for settler “democracy.” Yet that same claim is advanced for Afrikan prisoners (slaves), as though they either had more common interests with their slavemasters, or were more brainwashed. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00N980EQK&amp;location=482">482</a> ^ref-59943</p>

<p>Bacon’s Rebellion define its main program. This was a classic settler liberal-conservative debate, which still echoes into our own times, — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00N980EQK&amp;location=556">556</a> ^ref-7078</p>
<hr/>
<p>Nothing raises more enthusiasm among Euro-Amerikan settlers than attacking people of color — they embrace it as something between a team sport and a national religion. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00N980EQK&amp;location=562">562</a> ^ref-10748</p>
<hr/>
<p>“Bacon and his men did not kill a single enemy Indian but contented themselves with frightening away, killing, or enslaving most of the friendly neighboring Indians, and taking their beaver and land as spoils.” — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00N980EQK&amp;location=583">583</a> ^ref-9609</p>
<hr/>
<p>Killing, enslaving, and robbing was the exact central concern of this movement — which Euro-Amerikans tell us is an example of how we should unite with them! There’s a message there for those who wish to pick it up. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00N980EQK&amp;location=595">595</a> ^ref-10373</p>
<hr/>
<p>those Indians who did give themselves up to unity with the oppressors, becoming the settlers’ lackeys and allies, were not protected by it, but were destroyed. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00N980EQK&amp;location=636">636</a> ^ref-26309</p>

<p>How meaningful is a “democratic” extension of voting rights amidst the savage expansion of a capitalist society based on genocide and enslavement? — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00N980EQK&amp;location=650">650</a> ^ref-46878</p>

<hr/>
<p>The enrollment of the white masses into new, mass instruments of repression — such as the formation of the infamous Slave Patrols in Virginia in 1727 — is obviously anti-democratic and reactionary. Yet these opposites in form are, in their essence, united as aspects of creating the new citizenry of Babylon. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00N980EQK&amp;location=665">665</a> ^ref-13445</p>
<hr/>
<p>1776 War of Independence, a war in which most of the Indian and Afrikan peoples opposed settler nationhood and the consolidation of Amerika. In fact, the majority of oppressed people gladly allied themselves to the British forces in hopes of crushing the settlers. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00N980EQK&amp;location=669">669</a> ^ref-52951</p>
<hr/>
<p>The decisive point came when British capitalism decided to clip the wings of the new Euro-Amerikan bourgeoisie — they restricted emigration, hampered industry and trade, and pursued a long-range plan to confine the settler population to a controllable strip of territory along the Atlantic seacoast. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00N980EQK&amp;location=672">672</a> ^ref-59218</p>
<hr/>
<p>the settler bourgeoisie was, in the main, conservative and uncertain about actual war. It was the land question that in the end proved decisive in swaying the doubtful among the settler elite. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00N980EQK&amp;location=678">678</a> ^ref-13563</p>
<hr/>
<p>The British Quebec Act of 1773, however, attached all the Amerikan Midwest to British Canada. The Thirteen Colonies were to be frozen out of the continental land grab, with their British cousins doing all the looting. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00N980EQK&amp;location=686">686</a> ^ref-49622</p>
<hr/>
<p>as the first flush of settler enthusiasm faded into the unhappy realization of how grim and bloody this war would be, the settler “sunshine soldiers” faded from the ranks to go home and stay home. Almost one-third of the Continental Army deserted at Valley Forge. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00N980EQK&amp;location=696">696</a> ^ref-43363</p>

<p>enlistment bribes were widely offered to get recruits. New York State offered new enlistments 400 acres each of Indian land. Virginia offered an enlistment bonus of an Afrikan slave — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00N980EQK&amp;location=698">698</a> ^ref-4021</p>
<hr/>
<p>In South Carolina, Gen. Sumter used a share-the-loot scheme, whereby each settler volunteer would get an Afrikan captured from Tory estates. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00N980EQK&amp;location=700">700</a> ^ref-8670</p>
<hr/>
<p>Far from being either patriotic Amerikan subjects or passively enslaved neutrals, the Afrikan masses threw themselves daringly and passionately into the jaws of war on an unprecedented scale — that is, into their own war, against slave Amerika and for freedom. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00N980EQK&amp;location=704">704</a> ^ref-4182</p>
<hr/>
<p>the Euro-Amerikan settlers, sitting on the dynamite of a restive, nationally oppressed Afrikan population, were terrified — and outraged. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00N980EQK&amp;location=709">709</a> ^ref-23276</p>

<p>Tom Paine, in his revolutionary pamphlet Common Sense, raged against “…that barbarous and hellish power which hath stirred up Indians and Negroes to destroy us.” — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00N980EQK&amp;location=713">713</a> ^ref-30985</p>
<hr/>
<p>By the thousands upon thousands, Afrikans struggled to reach British lines. One historian of the Exodus has said: “The British move was countered by the Americans, who exercised closer vigilance over their slaves, removed the able-bodied to interior places far from the scene of the war, and threatened with dire punishment all who sought to join the enemy. To Negroes attempting to flee to the British the alternatives ‘Liberty or Death’ took on an almost literal meaning. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00N980EQK&amp;location=723">723</a> ^ref-51152</p>
