<p>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS </p>
<p>It is a pleasure to acknowledge the debt that I owe to the friends whom <br/>
I have consulted in the many and various difficulties which beset a trans¬ <br/>
lator of such a long text as the Sira on which there is no commentary <br/>
worthy of the name. My thanks are especially due to my old friend Pro¬ <br/>
fessor A. A. Affifi of Alexandria, Professor A. Kh. Kinani of Damascus, <br/>
Dr. Abdullah al-Tayib of Khartoum, Dr. M. A. Azzam of Cairo, and <br/>
Professor A. K. S. Lambton of London. Particularly I would thank Dr. <br/>
W. Arafat for his self-sacrificing labour in reading the whole of my transla¬ <br/>
tion in manuscript, and for bringing its shortcomings to my notice. If, <br/>
with reference to this book of mine, I am ever able to solace myself with <br/>
the words kafa'l-mar’a fadlan an tuadda ma'ayibuh, it will be in great <br/>
measure due to his ready help and eagle eye. </p>
<p>Last, but not least, I gratefully acknowledge the generosity of the School <br/>
of Oriental and African Studies in meeting the'eost of production. Without <br/>
this help it would have been impossible to publish the book. I hope that <br/>
in the years to come it will stand as a modest tribute to the School’s great <br/>
interest in Oriental studies and also help to further co-operation and <br/>
friendliness between my country and the Islamic world. </p>

<p>INTRODUCTION </p>
<p>THE AUTHOR </p>
<p>Muhammad, son of Ishaq, son of Yasar, was bom in Medina about <br/>
a.h. 85 and died in Baghdad in 151. 1 His grandfather Yasar fell into the <br/>
hands of Khalid b. al-Walid when he captured 'Aynu’l-Tamr in a.h. 12 , <br/>
having been held there as a prisoner by the Persian king. Khalid sent him <br/>
with a number of prisoners to Abu Bakr at Medina. There he was handed <br/>
over to Qays b. Makhrama b. ai-Muttalib b. 'Abdu Manaf as a slave, and <br/>
was manumitted when he accepted Islam. His family adopted the family <br/>
name of their patrons. His son Ishaq was born about the year 50, his <br/>
mother being the daughter of another freedman. He and his brother <br/>
Musa were well-known traditionists, so that our author’s path in life was <br/>
prepared before he reached manhood. 2 </p>
<p>He associated with the second generation of traditionists, notably <br/>
al-Zuhri, 'Asim b. <em>Umar b. Qatada, and ‘Abdullah b. Abu Bakr. He must <br/>
have devoted himself to the study of apostolic tradition from his youth, for <br/>
at the age of thirty he went to Egypt to attend the lectures of Yazid b. <br/>
Abu Habib. 3 There he was regarded as an authority, for this same Yazid <br/>
afterwards related traditions on Ibn Ishaq’s authority. 4 On his return to <br/>
Medina he went on with’the collection and arrangement of the material <br/>
he had collected. Al-Zuhri, who was in Medina in 123, is reported to have <br/>
said that Medina would never lack 'ilm as long as Ibn Ishaq was there, and <br/>
he eagerly gathered from him the details of the prophet’s wars. Unfortu¬ <br/>
nately Ibn Ishaq excited the enmity of Malik b. Anas, for whose work he <br/>
showed his contempt, and it was not long before his own writings and his <br/>
orthodoxy were called in question. Probably it was our author’s lost book <br/>
of Sunan s which excited Malik’s ire, for it would have been in the field <br/>
of law based on the practice of the prophet that differences would be most <br/>
keenly felt. He was accused of being a Qadari and a Shi'L Another man <br/>
attacked his veracity: he often quoted Fatima, the wife of Hisham b. <br/>
</em>Urwa, as the authority for some of his traditions. The husband was <br/>
annoyed and denied that he had ever met his wife; but as she was nearly <br/>
forty years Ibn Ishaq’s senior it is easily credible that they often met <br/>
without occasioning gossip. It is not known whether Ibn Ishaq was com¬ <br/>
pelled to leave Medina or whether he went away voluntarily. Obviously <br/>
he could not have the same standing in a place that housed his chief </p>

<p>informants as he would hold elsewhere, and so he left for the east, stopping <br/>
in Kufa, al-jazlra on the Tigris, and Ray, finally settling in Baghdad. While <br/>
Mansur was at Hashimlya he attached himself to his following and presented <br/>
him with a copy of his work doubtless in the hope of a grant from the caliph. <br/>
Thence he moved to Ray and then to the new capital of the empire. He <br/>
died in 150 (or perhaps 151) and was buried in the cemetery of Ilayzuran. </p>
<p>THE SIRA </p>
<p>Its precursors </p>
<p>It is certain that Ibn Ishaq’s biography of the prophet had no serious <br/>
rival; but it was preceded by several maghazi books. We do not know w r hen <br/>
they were first written, though we have the names of several first-century <br/>
worthies who had written notes and passed on their knowledge to the rising <br/>
generation. The first of these was Aban the son of the caliph 'Uthman. 1 <br/>
He was born in c. 20 and took part in the campaign of Talha and Zubayr <br/>
against his father’s slayers. He died about 100. The language used by <br/>
al-Waqidl in reference to Ibn al-Mughlra, ‘he had nothing written down <br/>
about hadith except the prophet’s maghdzls which he had acquired from <br/>
Aban’, certainly implies, though it does not demand, that Ibn al-Mughlra <br/>
wrote down what Aban told him. It is strange that neither Ibn Ishaq nor <br/>
al-Waqidi should have cited this man who must have had inside knowledge <br/>
of many matters that were not known to the public; possibly as a follower <br/>
of Ali he preferred to ignore the son of the man the Alids regarded as a <br/>
usurper. However, his name often appears in the isnads of the canonical <br/>
collections of hadith. (The man named in Tab. 2340 and I.S. iv. 29 is <br/>
Aban b. 'Uthman al-Bajall who seems to have written a book on maghazi. ) </p>
<p>A man of much greater importance was ‘Urwa b. al-Zubayr b. al- <br/>
'Awwam (23-94), a cousin of the prophet. ‘Urwa’s mother was Abu <br/>
Bakr’s daughter Asma’. He and his brother 'Abdullah were in close con¬ <br/>
tact with the prophet’s widow 'A’isha. He was a recognized authority on <br/>
the early history of Islam, and the Umayyad caliph 'Abdui-Malik applied <br/>
to him when he needed information on that subject. Again, it is uncertain <br/>
whether he wrote a book, but the many traditions that are handed down in <br/>
his name by I.I. and other writers justify the assertion that he was the <br/>
founder of Islamic history. 3 - Though he is the earliest writer whose notes <br/>
have come down to us, I have not translated the passages from Jab. which <br/>
reproduce them because they do not seem to add anything of importance <br/>
to the Sira. They form part of a letter which 'Unva wrote to 'Abdu <br/>
l-Malik who wanted to have accurate knowledge about the prophets <br/>
career. 4 Much of his material rests on the statements of his aunt 'A’isha. </p>

<p>Introduction xv </p>
<p>Like I.I. he was given to inserting poetry in his traditions and justified the <br/>
habit by the example of ‘A’isha who uttered verses on every subject that <br/>
presented itself. 1 He was a friend of the erotic poet ‘Umar b. Rabl'a, but <br/>
thought very little of the prophet’s poet Hassan b. Thabit. 2 </p>
<p>Of Shurahbil b. Sa‘d, a freedman, presumably of South Arabian origin, <br/>
little is known beyond the fact that he wrote a maghazi book. I.I. would <br/>
have none of him, and he is seldom quoted by other writers. He died in <br/>
123, and as he is said to have known Ali he must have died a centenarian. <br/>
He reported traditions from some of the prophet’s companions, and <br/>
Musa b. ‘Uqba 3 records that he wrote lists of the names of the emigrants <br/>
and the combatants at Badr and Uhud. In his old age he was discredited <br/>
because he blackmailed his visitors: if they did not give him anything he <br/>
would say that their fathers were not present at Badr! Poverty and extreme <br/>
age made him cantankerous. The victims of his spleen doubted his veracity, <br/>
though those best qualified to judge regarded him as an authority. </p>
<p>Another important Tabi‘ was Wahb b. Munabbih (34-110), a Yamanite <br/>
of Persian origin. His father probably was a Jew. He is notorious for his <br/>
interest in, and knowledge of, Jewish and Christian scriptures and tradi¬ <br/>
tions ; and though much that was invented later was fathered on him, his <br/>
K. al-Mubtadd lies behind the Muslim version of the lives of the prophets <br/>
and other biblical stories. With his books on the legendary history of the <br/>
Yaman, on aphorisms, on free will, and other matters preserved in part in <br/>
I.H.’s K. al-Tijdn we are not concerned; but the statement of Hajji <br/>
Khalifa that he collected the maghazi is now confirmed by the discovery of a <br/>
fragment of the lost work on papyri written in 228. Unfortunately this <br/>
fragment tells us little that is new; nevertheless, its importance is great <br/>
because it proves that at the end of the first century, or some years before <br/>
a.h. 100, the main facts about the prophet’s life were written down much <br/>
as we have them in the later works. Further it shows that, like the other <br/>
early traditionists, he had little or no use for isnads. Miss Gertrud Melamede 4 <br/>
has compared the account of the meeting at ‘Aqaba (cf. i. H. 288, 293, 299) <br/>
with the literature on the subject and her criticism, literary-and historical, <br/>
leads her to some important conclusions which do not concern us here. An <br/>
interesting detail is that Muhammad speaking to ‘Abbas calls Aus and <br/>
Khazraj ‘my and your maternal uncles’. ‘Abbas throughout runs with the <br/>
hare and hunts with the hounds. </p>
<p>A little later comes ‘Asim b. ‘Umar b. Qatada al-Ansarl (d. c. 120). He <br/>
lectured in Damascus on the campaigns of the prophet and the exploits <br/>
of his companions and seems to have committed his lectures to writing. <br/>
He too is quite inconsistent in naming his authorities: sometimes he gives <br/>
an isnad, more often he does not. He returned to Medina to continue his <br/>
work, and I.I. attended his lectures there. Occasionally he inserted verses <br/>
in his narrative, and sometimes gave his own opinion. </p>

<p>XVI </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Muhammad b. Muslim .., b. Shihab al-Zuhri (51-124) was a member of <br/>
a distinguished Meccan family. He attached himself to 'Abdu’l-Malik, <br/>
Hisham, and Yazld, and wrote down some traditions for his princely <br/>
pupils. He was the forerunner of the later traditionists in that he took <br/>
extraordinary pains to interrogate people, young and old of both sexes, who <br/>
might possess knowledge of the past. He left a history of his own family <br/>
and a book of maghazi. Most of his traditional lore survived in the notes <br/>
of his lectures that his pupils wrote down quoting his authority for the <br/>
traditions they record. He spent some years in Medina as a young man. </p>
<p>1.1. met him when he came south on pilgrimage and he is often named as an <br/>
authority in the Sira. He was the most important traditionist of his <br/>
generation, and his influence is to be seen in all collections of canonical <br/>
hadith. (See further J. Horovitz, Islamic Culture , ii. 33 ff.) </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr b. Muhammad b. 'Amr b. Hazm (d. 130 or 135) <br/>
was one of I.I.’s most important informants. His father had been ordered <br/>
by 'Umar b. 'Abdu’l-'Aziz to write a collection of prophetic hadith, <br/>
especially what 'Amra d. 'Abdu’l-Rahman said. This latter was a friend <br/>
of 'A’isha and she was the aunt of this Abu Bakr. Already in the time of his <br/>
son 'Abdullah these writings had been lost. Though we have no record of <br/>
a book by 'Abdullah, its substance probably once existed in the maghazi of <br/>
his nephew 'Abdu’l-Malik. As one would expect, the isnad is a matter of <br/>
indifference to 'Abdullah: he stood too near the events among many who <br/>
knew of them to need to cite his authorities. Tab. (i. 1837) contains an <br/>
interesting note on how I.I. got his information. 'Abdullah told his wife <br/>
Fatima to tell him what he knew on 'Amra’s authority. </p>
<p>Abu’l-Aswad Muhammad b. 'Abdu’l-Rahman b. Naufal (d. 131 or <br/>
137) left a maghazi book which sticks closely to 'Urwa’s tradition. 1 </p>
<p>Contemporary<em> with our author in the third generation was Musa b. <br/>
</em>Uqba (c. 55-141), a freedman of the family of al-Zubayr. A fragment of <br/>
his work has survived and was published by Sachau in 1904. 2 As it once <br/>
rivalled I.I.’s work and is one of our earliest witnesses to the Sira I have <br/>
given a translation of the extant traditions. 3 Although Malik b. Anas, <br/>
al-Shafi'I, and Ahmad b. Hanbal—an impressive trio—asserted that his <br/>
book was the most important and trustworthy of all, posterity evidently <br/>
did not share their opinion or more of his work would have survived. 4 </p>
<p>1.1. never mentions him. One cannot escape the conviction that petty <br/>
professional jealousy was as rife in those days as now, and that scholars <br/>
deliberately refrained from giving their predecessors credit for their <br/>
achievements. Musa leaned heavily on al-Zuhri. He seems to have carried <br/>
farther the process of idealizing the prophet. 5 He is freely quoted by <br/>
al-Waqidl, I. Sa'd, al-Baladhurl, Tabari, and I. Sayyidu’l-Nas. He gave </p>
<p>1 See Ftick, u. 2 S.B.B.A. xi. </p>
<p>3 v.i. where some doubts about the authenticity of some of them are raised. </p>
<p>4 Goldziher, M.S. ii. 207, shows that it was in circulation as late as the end of the 9th </p>
<p>century A.H. 5 Fiick, 12. </p>
<p>Introduction </p>
<p>XVII </p>
<p>lists of those who went to Abyssinia and fought at Badr. The latter <br/>
Malik regarded as authoritative. He generally gives an isnad , though it is <br/>
not always clear whether he is relying on a written or an oral source. Once <br/>
at least he refers to a mass of records left by Ibn 'Abbas (I.S. v. 216). <br/>
Occasionally he quotes poems. </p>
<p>Apart from the fragment of Wahb b. Munabbih’s maghazi the Berlin <br/>
MS., if it is authentic, is the oldest piece of historical literature in Arabic in <br/>
existence, and if only for that reason deserves more than a passing notice <br/>
here. It is of importance also because it carries back some of the traditions <br/>
in Bukhari (d. 256) more than a century. </p>
<p>Other maghazi works were produced in Iraq, Syria, and the Yaman <br/>
during the second century, but none of them is likely to have influenced </p>
<p>I.I. and they can safely be disregarded. 1 What is of significance is the <br/>
great interest in the life of the prophet that was shown everywhere during <br/>
this century. But no book known to the Arabs or to us can compare in <br/>
comprehensiveness, arrangement, or systematic treatment, with I.I.’s work <br/>
which will now be discussed. </p>
<p>The Sira </p>
<p>The titles The Book of Campaigns or The Book of Campaigns and (the <br/>
prophet s) Biography or The Book of the Biography and the Beginning and the <br/>
Campaigns- are all to be met with in the citations of Arabic authors. <br/>
AI-Bakka’i, a pupil of I.I., made two copies of the whole book, one of which <br/>
must have reached I.H. (d, 218) whose text, abbreviated, annotated, and <br/>
sometimes altered, is the main source of our knowledge of the original <br/>
work. A good deal more of it can be recovered from other sources. 3 The <br/>
principles underlying I.H.’s revision are set out in his Introduction <br/>
Sachau 4 suggests that the copy used by T. was made when I.I. was in Ray <br/>
by Salama b. FadI al-Abrash al-Ansarl, because T. quotes I.I. according to <br/>
I. FadI s nwaya . A third copy was made by Yunus b. Bukayr in Ray <br/>
This was used by I. al-Athlr in his Vsdu'l-Ghdba. A copy of part of this <br/>
recension exists in the Qarawlyln mosque at Fez. The text, which contains <br/>
some important additions to the received text, I hope to publish shortly <br/>
A fourth copy was that of the Syrian Harun b. Abu'Isa. These last two </p>
<p>copies were used by I. Sa'd. 5 Lastly the Fihrist mentions the edition of <br/>
al-Nufayll (d.‘ 234). </p>
<p>It must not be supposed that the book ever existed in three separate <br/>
parts: ancient legends, Muhammad’s early life and mission, and his wars <br/>
These are simply sections of the book which contained I.I.’s lectures. </p>
<p>For the Mubtada ’ (.Mabda ’) we must go to T’s Tafsir and History . The <br/>
first quotation from it in the latter 6 runs thus: T. Hamid said, Salama <br/>
b. al-Fadl.told us that I.I. said: “The first thing that God created was light </p>

<p>and darkness. Then He separated them and made the darkness night, <br/>
black exceeding dark; and He made the light day, bright and luminous. <br/>
From this it is clear that ‘Genesis’ is the meaning of the title of the first <br/>
section of the book. I.H. skipped all the intervening pages and began with <br/>
Abraham, the presumed ancestor of Muhammad. Al-Azraqi quotes some <br/>
passages from the missing section in his Akhbar Mecca and a few extracts </p>
<p>are given by al-Mutahhar b. Tahir. 1 </p>
<p>The Mubtada in so far as it lies outside I.H.’s recension is not our <br/>
concern, though it is to be hoped that one day a scholar will collect and <br/>
publish a text of it from the sources that survive so that I.I.’s work can be <br/>
read in its entirety as its importance warrants. In this section 1 . 1 . relied on <br/>
Jewish and Christian informants and on the book of Abu ‘Abdullah Wahb <br/>
b. Munabbih (34-no or 114) known as K. al-Mubtada and also al-Isra- <br/>
illy at of which the original title was Qisasu'LAnbiya. To him he owed <br/>
the history of the past from Adam to Jesus 2 and also the South Arabian <br/>
legends, some of which I.H. has retained. This man also wrote a maghazl <br/>
book, and a fragment of it has survived. 3 I.I. cites him by name only once. </p>
<p>It is natural that a book about Muhammad, ‘the seal of the prophets , <br/>
should give an account of the history of the early prophets, but the <br/>
history, or legends, of South Arabia demand another explanation. As <br/>
Goldziher showed long ago, 5 it was in the second half of the first century <br/>
that the antagonism of north and south, i.e. Quraysh and the Ansar of <br/>
Medina first showed itself in literature. The Ansar, proud of their southern <br/>
origin and of their support of the prophet when the Quraysh rejected him, <br/>
smarted under the injustice of their rulers and the northerner’s claim to <br/>
superiority. One of the ways in which their resentment manifested itselt <br/>
was in the glorification of Himyar’s great past. I.I. as a loyal son 0 <br/>
Medina shared the feelings of his patrons and recounted the achievements <br/>
of their forefathers, and I.H., himself of southern descent, retained in the <br/>
Sira as much of the original work as he thought desirable. To this accident <br/>
that I.H. was a Himyarl we owe the extracts from stories of the old South <br/>
Arabian kings. I.H. devoted a separate book to the subject, the K. al- <br/>
Tijan li-md rifati niuluki l-zaman (fi akhbdri Oahtan). h </p>
<p>The second section of the book which is often called al-Mab ath begins <br/>
with the birth of the prophet and ends when the first fighting from is ase <br/>
in Medina takes place. The impression one gets from this section is o <br/>
hazy memories; the stories have lost their freshness and have nothing ol <br/>
that vivid and sometimes dramatic detail which make the maghazi stories <br/>
especially in al-Waqidl—so full of interest and excitement. Thus while the <br/>
Medinan period is well documented, and events there are chronologi¬ <br/>
cally arranged, no such accuracy, indeed no such attempt at it, can be </p>

<p>claimed for the Meccan period. We do not know Muhammad’s age when <br/>
he first came forth publicly as a religious reformer: some say he "was forty, <br/>
others say forty-five; we do not know his precise relation to the Banu <br/>
Najjar; the poverty of his childhood ill fits the assertion that he belonged <br/>
to the principal family in Mecca. The story of those years is filled out with <br/>
legends and stories of miraculous events which inevitably undermine the <br/>
modern reader’s confidence in the history of this period as a whole. In <br/>
this section particularly, though not exclusively, I.I. writes historical <br/>
introductions to his paragraphs. A good example is his foreword to the <br/>
account of the persecution the prophet endured at the hands of the <br/>
Meccans: ‘When the Quraysh became distressed by the trouble caused by <br/>
the enmity between them and the apostle and those of their people who <br/>
accepted his teaching, they stirred up against him foolish fellows who called <br/>
him a liar, insulted him, and accused him of being a poet, a sorcerer, a <br/>
diviner, and of being possessed. However the apostle continued to pro¬ <br/>
claim what God had ordered him to proclaim, concealing nothing, and <br/>
exciting their dislike by contemning their religion, forsaking their idols, <br/>
and leaving them to their unbelief’. 1 This is not a statement resting on <br/>
tradition, but a concise summary of the circumstances that are plainly <br/>
indicated by certain passages of the Quran which deal with this period. </p>
<p>Of the Maghazl history little need be said. For the most part the stories <br/>
rest on the account of eyewitnesses and have every right to be regarded as <br/>
trustworthy. </p>
<p>Characteristics </p>
<p>The opinions of Muslim critics on I.I.’s trustworthiness deserve a special <br/>
paragraph; but here something may be said of the author’s caution and his <br/>
fairness. A word that very frequently precedes a statement is za’atna or <br/>
zdamu, ‘he (they) alleged’. It carries with it more than a hint that the <br/>
statement may not be true, though on the other hand it may be sound. <br/>
Thus there are fourteen or more occurrences of the caveat from p. 87 to <br/>
148 alone, besides a frequent note that only God knows whether a parti¬ <br/>
cular statement is true or not. Another indication of reserve if not scepti¬ <br/>
cism underlies the expression fl md dhukira li, as in the story of the jinn <br/>
who listened to Muhammad as he prayed; Muhammad’s order to ‘Umar <br/>
to kill Suwayd; one of Gabriel’s visits to Muhammad; the reward of two <br/>
martyrs to the man killed by a woman. 2 An expression of similar import is <br/>
fi md balaghani , 3 </p>
<p>Very seldom does I.I. make any comment of his own on the traditions <br/>
he records apart from the mental reservation implied in these terms. <br/>
Therefore when he does express an opinion it is the more significant. <br/>

<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>he allows us to see the working of his mind. The story is everywhere <br/>
hedged with reservations and terms suggesting caution to the reader. He <br/>
begins with a tale which he says has reached him {balagham) from several <br/>
narrators and he has pieced them together from the stories these people <br/>
heard (dhukira). The whole subject is a searching test of men s faith m <br/>
which those endowed with intelligence are specially concerned, it was <br/>
certainly an act of God, but exactly what happened we do not know. This <br/>
opinion of his is most delicately and skilfully expressed in the words <br/>
hayfa shd'a, ‘how God wished to show him’. I. Mas ud s words ar <br/>
prefaced by ft md balagham 'anhu. There is nothing in the story to indicate <br/>
that it is a vision. Al-Hasan’s version is much more definite, for he asserts <br/>
that when Muhammad returned to Mecca he told the Quraysh that he ha <br/>
been to Jerusalem and back during the night and that this so strained the <br/>
credulity of some of the Muslims that they gave up their faith in his revela¬ <br/>
tions although he was able to give an accurate description of Jerusalem. </p>
<p>It is therefore most surprising that al-Hasan should end his story by <br/>
quoting Sura 11. 62 ‘We made the vision which we showed thee only tor a <br/>
test to men’ in this context. The whole point of al-Hasan’s story is thereby <br/>
undermined, for if the experience was visionary, then there was nothing <br/>
at all incredible about it. Then follows 'A’isha’s statement, reported by <br/>
one of her father’s family, that it was only the apostle s spirit that was <br/>
transported; his body remained where it was in Mecca. Anot er ra 1- <br/>
tion by Mu'awiya b. Abu Sufyan bears the same meaning. The fac <br/>
had been asked whether it was a physical or a dream journey shows that the <br/>
subject was debated before I.I.’s day. Here I.I. makes a profound observa¬ <br/>
tion which in effect means that it was immaterial whether the experience <br/>
was real or visionary because it came from God; and just as Abra am ma e <br/>
every preparation to slay his son Isaac in consequence of what he had seen <br/>
in a dream 1 because he recognized no difference between a divine comman <br/>
given at night during sleep and an order given by day when he was awake <br/>
fo the apostle’s vision was just as real as if it had been an actual physical <br/>
experience. Only God knows what happened, but the apostle did see what <br/>
he said he saw and whether he was awake or asleep the result is the same. </p>
<p>The descriptibn of Abraham, Moses, and Jesus which purports to quote <br/>
Muhammad’s words is prefaced by zdamdl-Zuhri, not, as often, by e <br/>
ordinary term haddathanl. Now as al-Zuhri and I I knew each other <br/>
well and must have met quite often, we must undoubtedly infer from t <br/>
fact that I.I. deliberately substituted the verb of suspicion for the ordinary <br/>
term used in traditional matters that he means us to take this tradition wit </p>

<p>Comedy. 3 It rules out absolutely any but a physical experience and ought <br/>
to have been recorded with its cautionary note before I.I. made his own <br/>
observations. Possibly the reason for its being out of place is that it is an <br/>
excerpt from his lecture notes; but whatever the explanation, it mars the <br/>
effect of-his statement of the evidence. 2 </p>
<p>The phrase ‘God knows best’ speaks for itself and needs no comment. <br/>
It is sometimes used when the author records two conflicting traditions <br/>
and is unable to say which is correct. Another indication of the author’s <br/>
scrupulousness is the phrase ‘God preserve me from attributing to the <br/>
apostle words which he did not use’. His report of Muhammad’s first public <br/>
address at Medina and his order to each of his companions to adopt another <br/>
as a brother are prefixed by these words and hedged by ft md balagham. 3 </p>
<p>The author does not often give us rival versions of traditions from <br/>
Medina and Mecca; thus the account of ‘Umar’s conversion is interesting. 4 <br/>
It illustrates the thoroughness of our author in his search for information <br/>
about the early days of the prophet’s ministry. The first account he says is <br/>
based on what the traditionists of Medina said: ‘Umar was brutal to his <br/>
sister and brother-in-law who had accepted Islam, but feeling some <br/>
remorse when he saw blood on her face from the violent blow he had dealt <br/>
her, and impressed by her constancy, he demanded the leaf of the Quran <br/>
that* she was reading. Having read it he at once accepted it as inspired and <br/>
went to the prophet to proclaim his allegiance. </p>
<p>The Meccan, 'Abdullah b. Abu Najih, on the authority of two named <br/>
companions or an anonymous narrator, gives another version in ‘Umar’s <br/>
own words to the effect that his conversion was due to his hearing the <br/>
prophet recite the Quran while praying at the Ka'ba one night. In both <br/>
narratives it was the Quran which caused his conversion. In the first <br/>
version 'Umar was affected by the bearing of his sister and secured a part of <br/>
the Quran to read himself; in the second he was affected by the private <br/>
devotions of the prophet. The first story is prefixed by fi md balagham , but <br/>
this is cancelled as it were by the express statement that it was the current <br/>
belief of the people of Medina. I.I. concludes by saying that only God <br/>
knows what really happened. </p>
<p>A rather difficult problem in literary and historical criticism is posed by <br/>
the rival traditions 5 collected by the indefatigable T. from two of I.I.’s <br/>
pupils, Yunus b. Bukayr and Salama b. al-Fadl, the latter supported by <br/>
another pupil of I.I.’s named Ali b. Mujahid. The first had attended his <br/>
lectures in Kufa; the other two his lectures at Ray. All three claim that <br/>
they transmit what I.I. told them on the authority of a certain 'Aflf. I do <br/>
not know of a parallel in I.I.'s work to a contradiction resting on the authority <br/>
of the same original narrator. Different traditions from different rdwis <br/>
from different sources are to be expected in any history; but here the same </p>

<p>5 T- i- 1162. 8-1163. 2. </p>
<p>xxii The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>man is introduced as the authority for conflicting traditions such as are to <br/>
be found in the later collections of hadith. </p>
<p>The first tradition is suspect because it requires us to believe that from <br/>
the earliest days of his ministry before he had any following apart from a <br/>
wife and a young nephew Muhammad prophesied the Arab conquest of the <br/>
Byzantine and Persian empires in the Near East. Nothing in his life gives <br/>
the slightest support to this claim, though it was to be made good soon after <br/>
his death. </p>
<p>The second contains no reference to later conquests and may be trust¬ <br/>
worthy. It definitely fixes the scene at Mina, which is about three miles <br/>
distant from Mecca. The first account suggests, though it does not assert, <br/>
that the prophet was in Mecca, as he turned to face the Ka'ba when he <br/>
prayed. Would he have done this had he been in Mina? Would he not <br/>
rather have turned in the direction of Jerusalem, his first qibla ? LI. <br/>
expressly affirms elsewhere 1 that while he was in Mecca Muhammad when <br/>
praying turned his face towards Syria. The second account says nothing <br/>
about the direction of his prayer. On the whole, then, the second tradition <br/>
as transmitted by Salama must be given the preference. </p>
<p>It is quite easy to see why I.H. a century later omitted both traditions; <br/>
they were offensive to the ruling house of 'Abbas as they drew attention <br/>
to an unhappy past which the rulers, now champions of orthodoxy, would <br/>
fain have forgotten. But why did I.I. report them both, if in fact he did? <br/>
On the whole it seems most reasonable to suppose that he first dictated the <br/>
tradition which Yunus heard in Kufa, notorious for its attachment to the <br/>
Alid party, and that he afterwards dropped it and substituted the second <br/>
version which Salama heard in Ray some years later before he went on to <br/>
Baghdad. T. with his usual thoroughness reported both traditions. The <br/>
only alternative is to suppose that the reference to the conquests is an <br/>
interpolation. </p>
<p>There is a subtle difference between these two variants which ought not <br/>
to be overlooked. At first sight it would seem to be a mere detail that in the <br/>
first tradition 'Afif wished that he had been the third to pray the Muslim <br/>
prayer. Now there were already three—Muhammad, Khadija, and Ali. In <br/>
the second tradition he wished that he had been the fourth. If this latter <br/>
is the original form of the tradition it means simply that he wished that he <br/>
had been the first man outside the prophet’s family circle to accept Islam. <br/>
But the first tradition means more than this: by eliminating, as it were, <br/>
Muhammad himself from the trio it means that Ali was the second human <br/>
being and the first male to accept Islam and to stand with Khadija at the <br/>
head of all Muslims in the order of priority. This has always been the <br/>
claims of the Shi'a and to this day the priority of Ali in this respect is <br/>
hotly disputed. 2 </p>

<p>Introduction xx {jf </p>
<p>Intrinsically as we have argued, the second tradition has the better <br/>
claim to authenticity. If that is admitted it follows that either I.I. or his <br/>
rawi adapted it in the interest of the Alid cause. In view of the accusation <br/>
of partiality towards the Shi'a which was levelled against I.I. 1 it seems <br/>
probable that he himself gave a subtle twist to the tradition that had come <br/>
down to him from 'Afif, and afterwards played for safety. </p>
<p>As one would expect of a book which was written in the eighth century <br/>
about a great religious reformer, miracles are accepted as a matter of <br/>
course. It does not matter if a person’s alleged power to work miracles <br/>
makes his early sufferings and failures unintelligible, nor does it matter if <br/>
the person concerned expressly disclaimed all such powers apart from the <br/>
recitation of the Quran itself. 2 The Near East has produced an enormous <br/>
number of books on the miracles of saints and holy men and it would be <br/>
strange indeed if Islam had not followed in the footsteps of its predecessors <br/>
m glorifying the achievements of its great leader at the expense of his human <br/>
greatness. Here we are concerned simply with the literary form of such <br/>
stories, the authorities that are quoted for them, and the way in which our <br/>
author deals with them. To mention a few: 3 the prophet summoned a <br/>
tree to him and it stood before him. He told it to go back again and back it <br/>
went It is interesting to -otice that the person for whose benefit this <br/>
miracle was wrought regarded it as sorcery. The author’s father Ishaq b <br/>
Yasar, is responsible for the tale. Another tradition from 'Amr b. 'Ubayd <br/>
who claimed to have had it from Jabir b. 'Abdullah via al-Hasan, is merely <br/>
zrmdrash composed to explain Sura 5. 14 where it is said that God kept <br/>
the hands of Muhammad’s enemies from doing him violence. The story <br/>
of the throne of God shaking when the doors of heaven were opened to <br/>
5 S ve t S *' d shows how these dories grew in the telling. Mu'adh b. <br/>
Kira a al-Zuraql reported on the authority of ‘anyone you like among my <br/>
clan that when Sa'd died Gabriel visited the prophet and asked him who it <br/>
was that had caused such commotion in heaven, whereupon Muhammad <br/>
knowing that it must be Sa'd, hurried off at once to find that he had died! <br/>
However, more was said on the subject: 'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr from <br/>
Amra d. Abdu’l-Rahman reported that 'A’isha met Sa'd’s cousin outside <br/>
Mecca and asked him why he did not show more grief for one whose <br/>
arrival had shaken the very throne of God. An anonymous informant <br/>
claimed to have heard from al-Hasan al-Basri that the pallbearers found <br/>
the corpse of this fat, heavy man unexpectedly light, and the prophet told <br/>
them that there were other unseen bearers taking the weight with them- <br/>
and again it is repeated that the throne shook. Suhayll has a fairly long <br/>
passage on the tradition which goes to show that serious minded men did <br/>
not like this story at all. Some scholars tried to whittle away the meaning <br/>
by suggesting that the shaking of the throne was a metaphor for the joy </p>

<p>in heaven at Sa'd’s arrival; others claimed that the angelic bearers of the <br/>
throne were meant. But Suhayli will have none of this. The throne is a <br/>
treated object and so it can move. Therefore none has the right to depart <br/>
from the plain meaning of the w'ords. Moreover, the tradition is authentic <br/>
w T hile traditions like that of al-Barra’ to the effect that it was Sa'd’s bed <br/>
that shook are rightly ignored by the learned. He goes on to point out that <br/>
al-Bukhari accepted the tradition not only on the authority of Jabir but <br/>
also on the report of a number of other companions of the prophet—a <br/>
further indication of the snowball growth of the legend. S. finds it most <br/>
surprising that Malik rejected the hadith and he adds naively from the <br/>
point of view of later generations that Malik would not have it mentioned <br/>
despite the soundness of its transmission and the multitude of narrators, <br/>
and he adds that it may be that Malik did not regard the tradition as sound! <br/>
The passage is instructive in that it shows how far 1. 1 . could go in the <br/>
face of one of the most learned of his contemporaries in Medina. Posterity <br/>
has sided with 1 . 1 . on this matter, but Malik clearly had many on his side <br/>
at the time, men who would not take at its face value a story which they <br/>
could not reject out of hand, as he did, with the weight of contemporary <br/>
opinion behind it. </p>
<p>Another feature that stands out clearly from time to time is the insertion <br/>
of popular stories on the Goldilocks model. For the sake of the reader <br/>
I have rendered these stories in accord with modern usage, as the repetition <br/>
of the same words and the same answer again and again is intolerable to <br/>
the modern adult. Such stories are the stock-in-trade of the Arabian <br/>
gdss and the storyteller all the w r orld over and invariably lead up to the <br/>
climax which it is the speaker’s intention to withhold until he has his <br/>
audience on tiptoe. A good example of such stories is the narrative of <br/>
Muhammad’s arrival in Medina and the invitation of one clan after another, <br/>
always declined with the same words. 1 </p>
<p>After giving due weight to the pressure of hagiology on the writer and his <br/>
leaning towards the Shi‘a one must, I think, affirm that the life of Muham¬ <br/>
mad is recorded with honesty and truthfulness and, too, an impartiality <br/>
which is rare in such writings. Who can read the story of al-Zabir, 2 who <br/>
was given his life, family, and belongings but did not want to live when the <br/>
best men of his people had been slain, without admitting that here we have <br/>
a true account of what actually happened? Similarly who but an impartial <br/>
historian would have included verses in which the noble generous character <br/>
of the Jews of the Hijaz was lauded and lamented? The scepticism of <br/>
earlier writers seems to me excessive and unjustified. We have only to <br/>
compare later Lives of Muhammad to see the difference between the <br/>
historical and the ideal Muhammad. 3 </p>
<p>1 335 f<em> 2 P</em> 6yi. </p>
<p>3 Noldeke, Islam, v, 1914, has drawn attention to many incidents and characteristics of <br/>
the Sira which could not have been invented and which show intimate knowledge of the <br/>
facts. </p>
<p>The Poetry </p>
<p>Doubts and misgivings about the authenticity of the poems in the Sira <br/>
are expressed so often by I.H. that no reference to them need be given <br/>
here. Nevertheless, one should be on one’s guard against the tendency to <br/>
condemn all the poetry out of hand. What I.H. says about the poetry of <br/>
those who took part in the battle of Badr, whether or not it includes the <br/>
verses of Hassan b. Thabit, namely ‘These verses (of Abu Usama) are the <br/>
most authentic of those (attributed to) the men of Badr’ (p. 534), casts <br/>
grave doubt on the authenticity of a large section of the poetry of the <br/>
Sira. Nevertheless 1 . 1 . is not to be blamed for the inclusion of much that <br/>
is undoubtedly spurious without a thorough investigation which has not <br/>
yet been undertaken. The poems he cites on pp. 284 and 728 he got from <br/>
*Asim b. Qatada, while those on pp. 590,789, and 793 come from ‘Abdullah <br/>
b. Abu Bakr. 1 We know, too, that Musa b. ‘Uqba cited verses. 2 </p>
<p>An early critic of poetry, al-Jumahi 3 (d. 231), though perhaps rather <br/>
one-sided and ill balanced in his judgement on 1.1., makes some observa¬ <br/>
tions which cannot fail to carry conviction. He says: ‘Muhammad b. <br/>
Ishaq was one of those who did harm to poetry and corrupted it and passed <br/>
on all sorts of rubbish. He was one of those learned in the biography of the <br/>
prophet and people quoted poems on his authority. He used to excuse <br/>
himself by saying that he knew nothing about poetry and that he merely <br/>
passed on what was communicated to him. But that was no excuse, for he <br/>
wrote down in the Sira poems ascribed to men who had never uttered a <br/>
line of verse and of women too. He even went to the length of including <br/>
poems of ‘Ad and Thamud! Could he not have asked himself who had <br/>
handed on these verses for thousands of years when God said: “He <br/>
destroyed the first ‘Ad and Thamud and left none remaining” 4 while of <br/>
‘Ad he said “Can you see anything remaining of them?” 5 and “Only God <br/>
knows ‘Ad and Thamud and those who came after them.” ’ 6 Some of these <br/>
poems are quoted by T. 7 </p>
<p>I. al-Nadim 8 goes farther by suggesting that 1 . 1 . was party to the fraud: <br/>
the verses were composed for him, and when he was asked to include them <br/>
in his book he did so and brought himself into ill repute with the rhapso- <br/>
dists. Occasionally 1 . 1 . says who the authority for the poetry was. 9 </p>
<p>Obviously at this date criticism of the poetry of the Sira can be based <br/>
only on historical and perhaps in a lesser degree on literary and stylistic <br/>
grounds. Some of the poetry dealing with raids and skirmishes, tribal <br/>
boasting, and elegies seems to come from contemporary sources, and no <br/>
reasonable person would deny that poetic contests between Meccan and <br/>
Medinan poets really took place: everything we know of ancient Arab </p>

<p>society would require us to look for such effusions. As Horovitz pointed <br/>
out, in pre-Islamic poetry these poetical contests are frequent, and it <br/>
might be added that in early Hebrew history verses are frequently inserted <br/>
in the narratives and often put into the mouths of the heroes of the hour. <br/>
Thus, apart from those poems which undoubtedly were called forth by the <br/>
events they commemorated, poetry was an integral part of a racial conven¬ <br/>
tion which no writer of history could afford to ignore. Probably if all the <br/>
poetry which 1 . 1 . included in the Sira had reached that standard of excel¬ <br/>
lence which his readers were accustomed to expect, none of these charges <br/>
would have been levelled against him. But when he included verses which <br/>
were palpably banal, and were at the same time untrue to circumstance, <br/>
uninspired and trivial, as many undoubtedly are, the developed aesthetic <br/>
sense of the Arabs which is most delicate where poetry is concerned rejected <br/>
what he wrote. As aLJumahl said, he brought poetry itself into disrepute <br/>
by the balderdash he admitted into his otherwise excellent work. And it did <br/>
not improve matters that much that was good was mingled with more that <br/>
was bad. It is more than likely that 1 . 1 . himself was conscious that all was <br/>
not well with this poetry, for the general practice of writers is to put the <br/>
verse into the narrative at the crucial moment (as 1.1. at times does), <br/>
whereas after the prose account of Badr and Uhud he lumps together a <br/>
whole collection of verse by various ‘poets’. It is as though he were <br/>
silently saying ‘This is what has been handed on to me. I know nothing <br/>
about poetry and you must make your own anthology.’ 1 Even so, whatever <br/>
his shortcomings were, it is only fair to bear in mind that I.H. often inserts <br/>
a note to the effect that the text before him contains lines or words which <br/>
have not I.I.’s authority. </p>
<p>The subject is one that calls for detailed and careful literary criticism. <br/>
The history of the cliches, similes, and metaphors needs investigation by a <br/>
scholar thoroughly grounded in the poetry of the pre-Islamic and Umay- <br/>
yad eras. Until this preliminary work has been successfully accomplished <br/>
it would be premature to pass judgement on the poetry of the Sira as a <br/>
whole. Ancient poetry has suffered greatly at the hands of forgers, <br/>
plagiarists, and philologists, and the diwans of later poets have not escaped <br/>
the dishonest rawt. Hassan. b. Thabit, the prophet’s own poet, has many <br/>
poems to his name which he would be astounded to hear, and there are <br/>
comparatively few poets of whom it could be said that the diwans bearing <br/>
their names contained nothing for which they were not responsible. 2 </p>
<p>1 And this was precisely his attitude if al-Jumatu is to be believed. </p>
<p>2 I should hardly care to go so far as to assert that the fifth-century poet 'Amr b, Qaml'a <br/>
has exercised a direct influence on the poetry of the Stra; but the fact remains that there is <br/>
a great similarity. It is inevitable that the themes of Arab verse should recur constantly. <br/>
Beduin life varied little from generation to generation. Their horizon was bounded by <br/>
deserts, and consequently camels and horses, war and its weapons, hospitality and tribal <br/>
pride were constantly mentioned in song. To trace these themes back to their first singers <br/>
would b 4 a task that would leave little leisure for more profitable studies; but nevertheless <br/>
it is worth noting that the following themes recur in 'Amr and the Sira: the generous man <br/>
who slaughters camels for the hungry guest in winter when famine deprives even the rich of </p>
<p>Introduction xxvii </p>
<p>Since these words were written two theses have been written in the <br/>
University of London: the first by Dr. M. A. ‘Azzam deals with the style, <br/>
language, and authenticity of the poetry contained in the Sira ; the second <br/>
by Dr. W. 'Arafat with the Diwan of Hassan b. Thabit. A brief summary of <br/>
their findings will not be out of place here. </p>
<p>Between the period covered by the Sira and the editing of the book <br/>
itself loom the two tragedies of Karbala’, when al-Husayn and his followers <br/>
were slain in 61, and the sack of Medina in a.h. 63 when some ten thousand <br/>
of the Ansar including no less than eighty of the prophet’s companions <br/>
are said to have been put to death. Much of the poetry of the Sira was <br/>
meant to be read against the background of those tragedies. Its aim is to <br/>
set forth the claims of the Ansar to prominence in Islam not only as men <br/>
who supported the prophet when the Quraysh opposed him, but as men <br/>
descended from kings. The prophet was the grandson of 'Abdu’I-Mut- <br/>
talib, who was the son of Hashim and a woman of the B. al-Najjar, and so <br/>
of Yamani stock. ‘Your mother was of the pure stock of Khuza'a. ... To <br/>
the heroes of Saba’ her line goes back’, says the poet in his elegy on 'Abdu’l- <br/>
Muftalib, 1 </p>
<p>Apart from their great service to the prophet in giving him a home when <br/>
Quraysh cast him out, the Ansar long before had been partners with <br/>
Quraysh, for was it not Rizah, the half-brother of Qusayy, who came to the <br/>
aid of the ancestors of Quraysh from the Yaman? Had it not been for the <br/>
Ansar there would have been no Islam: had it not been for their ancestors, <br/>
the poet implies, Quraysh would not have been established in Mecca. </p>
<p>On p. 18 there is thinly disguised Ansarl-Shl'a propaganda: ‘The one <br/>
you killed was the best of us. The one who lived is lord over us and all of <br/>
you are lords’ would be recognized by many as a reference to the killing of <br/>
al-Husayn and the ‘lords’ would be the Umayyads. The account of the <br/>
Tubba's march against Mecca and his great respect for its sanctity stands <br/>
in clear contrast with the treatment it received from the Umayyads when <br/>
al-Hajjaj bombarded it. </p>
<p>wealth, when even kinsmen refuse their help; the man who entertains when the camels’ <br/>
udders are dry; the cauldron full of the hump and fat of the camel; those who devote the <br/>
game of maysir to hospitality, distributing the charge among themselves as the arrows dic¬ <br/>
tate; the milk of war; war a milch camel; war drawing blood like buckets from a well; a <br/>
morning draught of the same; the sword blade polished by the armourer; journeys in noon¬ <br/>
day heat when even the locust rests 1 , the horse that can outrun the wild ass; the flash of the <br/>
sun on the helmets of the warriors; the chain armour shining like a rippling pool. However <br/>
interesting this comparison might prove to be, the presence of these cliches and themes in <br/>
other poets makes it hazardous to assert that 'Amr had a predominating influence. More¬ <br/>
over, what we seek is a pseudo-poet of Umayyad times; and here a hint thrown out by a <br/>
former colleague, Dr. Abdullah al-Tayyib, to the effect that the poetry of the Sira and that <br/>
in Waq'at $iffiti is very similar, if followed up would probably lead to some interesting dis¬ <br/>
coveries. I.H.’s notes would be found interesting in this connexion. On p. 790 he points <br/>
out that the words ‘We have fought you about its interpretation as we fought you about its <br/>
divine origin’ were spoken by ‘AmmSr b. Yisir in reference to another battle [§iff!n] and <br/>
could not have been uttered by 'Abdullah b. RawJtfia at the conquest of Mecca, because the <br/>
Meccans, being pagans, did not believe in the Quran, so that there was no question of a <br/>
rival interpretation. 1 p. 113. </p>
<p>Introduction </p>
<p>xxviii The Life of Muham?nad </p>
<p>After a careful study of the language and style of this verse Dr. 'Azzam <br/>
comes to the conclusion that comparatively little of it dates from the time <br/>
of the prophet. </p>
<p>Dr. 'Arafat comes to much the same conclusion with regard to the <br/>
verse attributed to Hassan, A few of the outstanding arguments will be <br/>
given here. He finds that the eulogy on the Ansar (p. 893) which is attri¬ <br/>
buted to Ka'b b. Zuhayr is in the same rhyme and metre as the poem of <br/>
al-Akhtal 1 which was written at the instigation of Yazid. There we find <br/>
the words ‘Baseness is under the turbans of the Ansar’. A careful com¬ <br/>
parison of the relevant passages in the two poems shows that the one in the <br/>
Sira is the answer to the one in the Aghani. </p>
<p>Abdullah b. Abu Bakr is reported to have said; ‘The Ansar were <br/>
respected and feared until the battle of Harra; afterwards people were <br/>
emboldened to attack them and they occupied a lowly place.’ It is in these <br/>
circumstances, not those of the prophet’s companions daily increasing in <br/>
power and prestige, that we must look for the background of ‘You will find <br/>
that none ill uses or abuses us but a base fellow who has gone astray’ (p. 626). </p>
<p>On p. 474 a poem which I.H. attributes to Hassan’s son, 'Abdu’l-Rah- <br/>
man, obviously dates from a later generation: ‘My people are those who <br/>
sheltered the prophet and believed in him when the people of the land were <br/>
unbelievers except for choice souls who were forerunners of righteous men <br/>
and who were helpers with the helpers.’ What can this mean but that some¬ <br/>
one is speaking of the past services of his people to the prophet ? Further, <br/>
it is strange language to impute to Hassan. It was he who called the new¬ <br/>
comers vagrants jalabib and regarded them as an unmitigated nuisance. <br/>
He did not house any of the muhdjirin, nor was he a ‘brother* to one of <br/>
them. A still clearer reference to a former generation is to be found on <br/>
p. 927 (again I.H. attributed it to Abdu’I-Rahman) which says; ‘Those <br/>
people were the prophet’s helpers and they are my people; to them I come <br/>
when I relate my descent.’ </p>
<p>Dr. 'Arafat notes that in the Sira there are seventy-eight poems attri¬ <br/>
buted to Hassan; the authenticity of fifteen of them is questioned or denied <br/>
outright. The text of the poem on p. 738 in its rival forms illustrates the <br/>
way in which verses attributed to Hassan were interpolated and additional <br/>
verses fabricated. Here T. gives only the first five verses; the Diwan <br/>
interpolates two verses after the first line and adds two at the end. On <br/>
the other hand, the last three verses in the Sira are not to be found in <br/>
either of the other authorities. In the Aghani 2 the pofcm is still longer and <br/>
according to the riwaya of Mus'ab but without al-Zuhri’s authority. The <br/>
facts which emerge from a study of the circumstances which surround this <br/>
poem are: </p>
<ol>
<li>Hassan resented the growing numbers and influence of the Muslim <br/>
refugees. </li>
</ol>
<p>1 Agh. xiii. 148, xiv. 122. </p>
<p>2 Cairo, 1931, iv. 159. Cf. 157, where the shorter version of X- is given. </p>
<p>xxix </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>After the attack on B. al-Mustaliq a quarrel arose between the <br/>
Meccans and Medinans about the use of a well. 'Abdullah b. Ubayy <br/>
said: ‘They rival our numbers kathara y he called them jalabib and <br/>
threatened that when they got back to Medina the stronger a azz <br/>
would drive out the weaker. The words italicized are the very words <br/>
used by Hassan in this poem. From this it is clear that Hassan is <br/>
expressing not only his own opinion about the Muslims but that of <br/>
'Abdullah b. Ubayy and his party. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was during this journey that the scandal about 'A’isha arose. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Safwan struck Hassan with his sword. According to the introduction <br/>
to the poem in the Diwan Safwan attacked Hassan because he had <br/>
accused him of spending the night with 'A’isha. But in the Aghani <br/>
Safwan wounded Hassan at the instigation of the prophet because <br/>
his house was the centre of disaffection against the Muslims. The <br/>
other explanation of the attack on Hassan is added in al-Aghani as an <br/>
afterthought. However, there is no reason why both versions should <br/>
not be correct. Hassan’s most dangerous offence was his complaint <br/>
against the Muslim intruders; but when he slandered 'A’isha he <br/>
provided the prophet with an admirable reason for punishing him <br/>
severely for an offence which would not engage the sympathies of the <br/>
AnsarTs. Whether loyal or disaffected, they could hardly support <br/>
their comrade in such a matter. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With the further ramifications of the story we are not concerned; <br/>
sufficient has been said to show that the poem so far as verse 5 is genuine <br/>
and is directed solely against the Muslim refugees whose presence had <br/>
become a nuisance to Hassan. In this poem he says nothing at all about <br/>
Safwan. The last three lines have doubtless been added to whitewash <br/>
Hassan. As poetry they will not bear comparison with the genuine verses <br/>
and T. was thoroughly justified in discarding them. </p>
<p>Another specimen of the spurious poetry fathered on Hassan is to be, <br/>
found on p. 936 which belongs to a later generation. Here it is not the <br/>
prophet who is praised but his ‘house’: ‘How noble are the people ( qaum ) <br/>
whose party ( shi'a ) is the prophet! . . . They are the best of all living <br/>
creatures.’ When we remember the resentment with which the Ansar in <br/>
general and Hassan in particular felt when they got no share in the booty <br/>
of Hunayn, the line ‘Take from them what comes when they are angry and <br/>
set not your hearts on what they withhold’ is singularly inept. </p>
<p>Another point which militates against the authenticity of poems attri¬ <br/>
buted to Hassan is the prominence which is often given to the Aus. It <br/>
cannot be supposed that a Khazrajite Would ignore the achievements of his <br/>
own tribe or put them in the second place as on p. 455 when we remember <br/>
that the hostility between the two tribes persisted long after Islam was <br/>
established. A plain example of a later Ansari’s work is given on p. 711, <br/>
where the poem begins: ‘O my people is there any defence against fate and </p>
<p>xxx The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>can the good old days return ?’ an impossible attitude for a Muslim to take <br/>
during the prophet’s lifetime. </p>
<p>Again, when Hassan is reported to have said ‘The best of the believers <br/>
have followed one another to death’ (p. 799), it is sufficient to remember <br/>
that practically all the prophet’s principal companions survived Uhud. <br/>
But when this careless forger wrote all the best Muslims had long been <br/>
dead. However, we have not got to his main point which is to glorify the <br/>
house of Hashim: 'They are God’s near ones. He sent down His wisdom <br/>
upon them and among them is the purified bringer of the book.’ Here the <br/>
Alids are the ‘friends’ or ‘saints’ of God and Muhammad is little more than <br/>
a member of their family. Divine wisdom is given to them. </p>
<p>These two studies lay bare the wretched language in which many of <br/>
these poems are written and incidentally bring out the difficulties which a <br/>
translator has to cope with when the rules of Arabic syntax and the mor¬ <br/>
phology of the language are treated with scant respect. In fine it may be <br/>
said that their well-documented conclusions made it abundantly clear <br/>
that the judgement of the ancient critics—particularly al-Jumahi—is justi¬ <br/>
fied up to the hilt. 1 </p>

<p>It has been my aim to restore so far as is now possible the text of 1 . 1 . <br/>
as it left his pen or as he dictated it to his hearers, from excerpts in later <br/>
texts, disregarding the Mabda' section as I.H. did and for at least one of </p>

biographical details are to be found. The towns are those at which the individuals named <br/>

<p>Introduction xxxi </p>
<p>his reasons. At first I was tempted to think that a great deal of the original <br/>
had been lost—and it may well be that it has been lost—for it is clear that <br/>
the scurrilous attacks on the prophet "which I.H. mentions in his Introduc¬ <br/>
tion are not to be found anywhere. But on the whole I think it is likely <br/>
that we have the greater part of what 1.1, wrote. Doubtless more was said </p>
<p>Ali and against Abbas, but it is unlikely that such material would add <br/>
much to our knowledge of the history of the period. Possibly to us the <br/>
most interesting excisions would be paragraphs containing information <br/>
which I.I. gathered from Jews and Christians; but in all probability the <br/>
Mabda contained most of such passages. Still, it is unlikely that those <br/>
passages which have been allowed to remain would have excited the <br/>
annoyance that some of his early critics express on this score. Ibnu’l- <br/>
Kalbl’s K. al-Asnam gives a warning against exaggerated hopes. Yaqut <br/>
had made copious extracts from it in his Geographical Dictionary, so <br/>
interesting and so important for our knowledge of the old Arabian heathen¬ <br/>
ism that the great Noldeke expressed the hope that he would live to see the <br/>
text of the lost original discovered. He did; but a collation of the original <br/>
work with the excerpts made by Yaqut shows that practically everything <br/>
of value had been used and nothing of real significance was to be learned <br/>
from the discovery of the mother text. However, in a text of the nature of <br/>
the Sira it is just possible that a twist may be given to the narrative by an <br/>
editor such as I.H. </p>
<p>The writers from whom some of the original can be recovered are: </p>

<p>For our purpose none of these has the importance of T. whose text <br/>
rests on the riwdya of Salama and Yunus b. Bukayr. Besides the important <br/>
textual variants which will be found in the translation from time to time, <br/>
he it is who reports from I.I. the prophet’s temporary concession to poly¬ <br/>
theism at Mecca (1190 f.) and the capture of 'Abbas at Badr (1441). </p>
<ol>
<li>al-Waqidl. Only the Maghazi has survived from the very large <br/>
number of his writings. A third of it was published by von Kremer in <br/>
1856 from a poor manuscript, and until the work has been edited its value </li>
</ol>
<p>xxx ii The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>cannot be accurately assessed. 1 The abridged translation by Wellhausen 2 <br/>
gives the reader all the salient facts, but his method of epitomizing enabled <br/>
him to avoid difficulties in the text which call for explanation. Waqidi <br/>
makes no mention of I.I. among his authorities. The reason for this <br/>
doubtless is that he did not want to refer to a man who already enjoyed a <br/>
great reputation as an authority on maghdzi and so let it seem that his own <br/>
book was a mere amplification of his predecessor’s. It is by no means <br/>
certain that he made use of 1.1/s book, or traditional lore, for he quoted <br/>
his authorities, e.g. al-Zuhri, Ma'mar, and others, directly. On the other <br/>
hand, he did not belittle I.I. of whom he spoke warmly as a chronicler, <br/>
genealogist, and traditionist, who transmitted poetry and was an indefati¬ <br/>
gable searcher of tradition, a man to be trusted. </p>
<p>It follows that strictly Waqidi is not a writer from whom in the present <br/>
state of our knowledge we can reconstruct the original of the Sira ; but as <br/>
his narrative often runs parallel with I.I/s work, sometimes abridging, <br/>
sometimes expanding, his stories it is a valuable if uncontrolled supporter <br/>
thereof. Not until his Maghdzi has been published and studied as it <br/>
deserves to be can a satisfactory comparison of the two books be made. <br/>
One thing is abundantly clear, namely that Waqidi often includes stories <br/>
which obviously come from eyewitnesses and often throw valuable light <br/>
on events which are obscure in I.I. Indeed it ought to be said that t e </p>
<p>Sira is incomplete without Waqidi. 4 . </p>

<p>his pupils. This was afterwards combined with his Tabaqat in 300 y <br/>
I. Ma'ruf. Volumes la, b and I la, b in the Berlin edition deal with the <br/>
former prophets, Muhammad’s childhood, his mission, the hijra, an is <br/>
campaigns, ending with his death, burial, and elegies thereon. I.S. has <br/>
much more to say on some matters than 1.1., e.g. letters and embassies, and <br/>
the prophet’s last illness, while he shows no interest in pre-Islamic Arabia. <br/>
For the Maghdzi Waqidi is his main authority. The Tabaqat deals with t e <br/>

fiqh. They deal with the question of how much water a man may retain <br/>

last five citations belong to the age of the caliphs and need not concern us. <br/>
The remainder have a slight value for textual criticism. Sometimes they <br/>
lend support to T.’s version, and once at least a citation proves that the <br/>
tradition was not preserved orally because the variant readings could only <br/>
have come about through a transfer of a dot from the first to the second <br/>
letter with the consequent misreading of the third. The citations are brief <br/>
and concise: they tell all the truth that the writer needed for his purpose <br/>
but not the whole truth, which would have been irrelevant. </p>

<li>
<p>Tabari. A list of the additions to I.H.’s recension has been given by <br/>
Noldeke 1 and enough has been said about his value as a witness to the <br/>
original text of the Sira. No attempt has been made to recover the lost <br/>
part of the Mabda’ from his Tafsir. Where his variants are merely stylistic <br/>
and do not affect the sense of the passage I have ignored them. Practically <br/>
all of them will be found in the footnotes to the Leyden edition. He was <br/>
familiar with four of the recensions, numbers 4, 7, 9, and 10 on the list <br/>
given above, much the most frequently cited being Yunus b. Bukayr. On <br/>
one occasion (1074. 12) he remarks that I.I/s account is ‘more satisfactory <br/>
than that of Hisham b. Muhammad’ [al-Kalbl d. 204 or 206]. I.H. he <br/>
ignores altogether and he omits a good deal of the poetry now in the Sira. <br/>
Whether his selection was governed by taste, whether he thought some of it <br/>
irrelevant, or whether he regarded it as spurious I can find no indication. <br/>
He often gives the isttdd which is lacking in I.I. (cf. 1794. 12). On one <br/>
occasion at least (cf. W. 422 with T. 1271) it looks as if the narrative has <br/>
been deliberately recast. T. frequently omits the tasliya and tardiya as <br/>
ancient writers did. 2 I.H. omits Ka'b’s poem and the mention of its pro¬ <br/>
voking a killing, cf. 651 with T. 1445. </p>

<p>Ihn Ishaq's reputation , </p>
<p>Unfortunately for our purpose which is to record the opinion of our <br/>
author’s co-religionists on his trustworthiness as a historian, their judge¬ <br/>
ment is affected by his other writings, one of which called Sunan is men¬ <br/>
tioned by Hajji Khalifa. 1 This was freely quoted by Abu Yusuf (d. 182), 2 <br/>
but failed to hold its own and went out of circulation comparatively early. <br/>
If we knew more about the contents of this book, which by reason of its <br/>
early date presumably would have had a considerable influence on the <br/>
daily life of Muslims had it been allowed to continue to challenge other <br/>
reporters of the apostle’s deeds and words, we should be the better able to <br/>
assess the value and relevance of early Muslim criticism on 1 . 1 , when it <br/>
was most definitely hostile. It is not always his book the Sira which is <br/>
attacked but the man himself, and if his sunna work ran counter to the <br/>
schools of law that were in process of development the author could not <br/>
hope to escape strong condemnation. It is most important that this fact <br/>
should not be overlooked. In the passage Wustenfeld quoted 3 from <br/>
AbuTFath M. b. M. b. Sayyidu’I-Nas al-Ya'mari al-Andalusi (d. 734/ <br/>
1334) the distinction between traditions of a general nature and traditions <br/>
about the prophet’s sunna is clear and unmistakable. Ahmad b. Hanbal’s <br/>
son stated that his father included I.I.’s hadith in his Musnad, but refused <br/>
to regard him as an authority on sunan. While it is true that there are a <br/>
few stories in the Sira which report the prophet’s practice in certain <br/>
matters and so provide an authoritative guide for the future behaviour of <br/>
the faithful in similar circumstances, and while it is also true that in one or <br/>
two instances the principle underlying these actions is in conflict with the <br/>
findings of later lawyers, they form an insignificant part of the Sira , and it <br/>
may safely be concluded that I. Hanbal’s objection to I.I.’s authority <br/>
applies almost exclusively to his lost work, the Sunan. </p>
<p>Apostolic tradition in Islam, as Goldziher showed long ago, is the <br/>
battlefield of warring sects striving for the mastery of men’s minds and the <br/>
control of their behaviour with all the weight that Muhammad’s presumed <br/>
or fabricated example could bring to bear. The earlier the tradition, or <br/>
collection of traditions, the less this tendency is in evidence; but we have <br/>
already seen that I.I. occasionally succumbed to the temptation to glorify <br/>
Ali at the expense of 'Abbas. This would seem to be supremely unneces¬ <br/>
sary when one can read exactly what 'Abbas’s position was: at first hostile; <br/>
secondly neutral; and lastly, when the issue was no longer in doubt, a <br/>
professed Muslim. Obviously since no attempt is made to conceal or <br/>
diminish the affectionate loyalty of Abu Bakr or the staunch championship <br/>
of 'Umar, our author was no unbalanced fanatical supporter of the claims <br/>
of Ali. Ali appears as the great warrior when rival champions fought </p>

<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Abu Mu'awiya: A great memory: others confided their traditions to <br/>
his memory for safe keeping. </p>
<p>al- Bukhari: Al-Zuhri used to get his knowledge of the maghdzi from 1 . 1 . </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. Idris al-Audi: was amazed at his learning and often cited <br/>
him. </p>
<p>Mus'ab; He was attacked for reasons which had nothing to do with <br/>
tradition. </p>
<p>Yazid b. Harun: Were there a supreme relator of tradition it would be 1 . 1 . </p>
<p>Ali b. al-Madlni: His ahadith are sound. He had a great reputation in <br/>
Medina. Hisham b. 'Urwa’s objection to him is no argument against <br/>
him. He may indeed have talked to the latter’s wife when he was a <br/>
young man. His veracity in hadith is self-evident. I know only of <br/>
two that are rejected as unsupported 1 which no other writer reported. </p>
<p>al-'Ijli: Trustworthy. </p>
<p>Yahya b. Ma'in: Firm in tradition. </p>
<p>Ahmad b. Hanbal: Excellent in tradition. </p>
<p>(i b ) The writer then goes on to state all that has been said against 1 . 1 . <br/>
Omitting details of little significance we are left with the following charges <br/>
which I. Sayyidu’l-Nas goes on to discuss and refute. Muhammad b. <br/>
'Abdullah b. Numayr said that when LI. reported what he had heard from <br/>
well-known persons his traditions were good and true, but he sometimes <br/>
reported worthless sayings from unknown people. Yahya b. al-Qattan <br/>
would never quote him. Ahmad b. Hanbal quoted him with approval, and <br/>
when it was remarked how excellent the stories (qisas) were he smiled in <br/>
surprise. His son admitted that Ahmad incorporated many of I.I.’s <br/>
traditions in his Musnad y but he never paid heed to them. When he was <br/>
asked if his father regarded him as an authority on what a Muslim must <br/>
or must not do he replied that he did not. He himself would not accept a <br/>
tradition which only I.I. reported. He used to relate a tradition which he <br/>
gathered from a number of people without indicating who had contributed <br/>
its separate parts. I. al-Madini saicT that at times he was ‘fairly good’. <br/>
Al-Maymuni reported that I. Ma'in 156-233 said he was ‘weak’, but others <br/>
denied that he said so. Al-Duri said he was trustworthy but not to be used <br/>
as an authority in fiqh f like Malik and others. Al-Nasa’I said that he was not <br/>
strong. Al-Daraqutnl said that a tradition from I.I. on the authority of his <br/>
father was no legal proof: it could be used only to confirm what was already <br/>
held to be binding. Yahya b. Sa'id said that though he knew I.I. in Kufa <br/>
he abandoned him intentionally and never wrote down traditions on his <br/>
authority. Abu Da’ud al-Tayalisi (131-203) reported that Hammad b. <br/>
Salima said that unless necessity demanded it he would not hand on a <br/>
tradition from I.I. When Malik b. Anas mentioned him he said, ‘he is one <br/>
of the antichrists*. When Hisham b. 'Urwa was told that I.I. reported <br/>
something from Fatima he said, ‘the rascal lies; when did he see my wife?’ </p>
<p>1 These probably belong to the Sunan. </p>
<p>Introduction xxxvii </p>
<p>When AMuUah b. Ahmad told his father of this he said that this was not to <br/>
be held against I.I ; he thought that he might well have received permission <br/>
interview her, but he did not know. He added that Milik was a liar. <br/>
• Idris said that he talked to Malik about the Maghazi and how I.I had <br/>
said that he was their surgeon and he said, ‘We drove him from Medina' <br/>
Makki b^ Ibrahim said that he attended lectures of his; he used to dye his <br/>
, . * , en be mentl °ned traditions about the divine attributes he left </p>
<p>f 11 , n ? Ver W j nt , back ’ 0n occasion he said that when he left </p>
<p>nim he had attended twelve lectures of his in Ray. </p>
<p>Al-Mufaddal b. Ghassan said that he was present when Yazid b. Harun <br/>
was re ating traditions in al-Baqi' when a number of Medinans were <br/>
listening. When he mentioned I.I. they withdrew saying; ‘Don’t tell us <br/>
anything that he said. We know better than he.’ Yazid went among them, <br/>
but they would not listen and so he withdrew. </p>
<p>Abu Da’ud said that he heard Ahmad b. Hanbal say that I.I. was a man <br/>
with a love of tradition, so that he took other men’s writings and incorporated <br/>
them m his own Abu 'Abdullah said that he preferred I.I. to Musa b. <br/>
Ubaydaal-Rabadhi. Ahmad said that he used to relate traditions as though <br/>
trom a companion without intermediaries, while in Ibrahim b. Sa'd’s book </p>

<p>A^mad b. Hanbal said that in maghdzi and such matters what I.I. said <br/>
could be written down; but in legal matters further confirmation was <br/>
necessary In spite of the large number of traditions without a proper <br/>
tstiad he thought highly of him as long as he said ‘A told us’, informed <br/>
me, and I hea ^_* I. Ma'in did not like to use him as a n authority in </p>

<ul>
<li>aymi called him a liar and Yahya al-Qattan said that he could only <br/>
abandon his hadith to God; he was a liar. When Yahya asked Wuhayb b <br/>
lOialid what made him think that I.I. was a liar he said that Malik swore <br/>
that he was and he gave as his reason Hisham b. 'Urwa’s oath to that effect </li>
</ul>
<p>au-S 1 ! 3 T Tr° n W * S that he re P° rted traditions from his wife Fatima.' <br/>
Abu Bakr al-Khatlb said that some authorities accepted his traditions <br/>
as providing proof for legal precedent while others did not. Among the <br/>
reasons for rejecting his authority was that he was a Shi'i, that he was said <br/>
to hold the view that man had free will, and that his isndds were defective <br/>
As lor hi3 truthfulness, it could not be denied. </p>
<p>1 See No. 8. </p>
<p>xxxviii The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Al-Bukhari quoted him as an authority and Muslim cited him often. <br/>
Abu’l-Hasan b. al-Qatfan relegated him to the class ‘good’ ( hasan ) because <br/>
people disputed about him. As to the tradition from Fatima, al-Khatib <br/>
gave us an isnad running back through 1 . 1 . and Fatima to Asma’d. Abu <br/>
Bakr: ‘I heard a woman questioning the prophet and saying, “I have a <br/>
rival wife and I pretend to be satisfied with what my husband has not in fact <br/>
given me in order to anger her”. He answered, “He who affects to be <br/>
satisfied with what he has not been given is like one who dons two false <br/>
garments ”.’ 1 Abu’l-Hasan said that this was the tradition from Fatima <br/>
which injured I.I/s reputation, so that her husband Hisham called him a <br/>
liar. Malik followed him and others imitated them. However, there are <br/>
other traditions on her authority. </p>
<p>One cannot but admire the way in which I. Sayyidu’l-Nas discusses <br/>
these attacks on.the credibility of our author. He goes at once to the root of <br/>
the matter and shows what little substance there is in them. Though, like <br/>
the speakers he criticizes, he tacitly assumes that early writers ought to <br/>
have furnished their traditions with isnads which would have met the <br/>
rigorous demands of later generations who were familiar with a whole sea <br/>
of spurious traditions fathered on the prophet and his companions, his <br/>
common sense and fairness would not let him acquiesce in the charge of <br/>
tadlis which, by omitting a link in the chain or by citing the original <br/>
narrator without further ado, automatically invalidated a hadith in later <br/>
days. Thus he said in effect that though I.I.’s traditions at times lack <br/>
complete documentation there is no question of his truthfulness in the <br/>
subject-matter he reports; and as to the charge of shl'ism and qadarite <br/>
leanings, they are valid in another field altogether and have nothing to do <br/>
with the Sira. Again, what if Makki b. Ibrahim did abandon his lectures <br/>
when he heard him relate traditions about the divine attributes ? Many of <br/>
the ancients failed to go the whole way when such problems were discussed, <br/>
so what he says is of little significance. </p>
<p>Yazld’s story that the Madinans would not listen to traditions on I.I.’s <br/>
authority does not amount to much because he does not tell us why, and so <br/>
we can resort only to conjecture; and we have no right to impugn a true <br/>
tradition because of what we think is a defect. We have already explained <br/>
why Yahya al-Qa$tan would have none of him and called him liar on the <br/>
authority of Wuhayb from Malik, and it is not improbable that he was the <br/>
cause of the Medinans’ attitude in the foregoing account.. Ahmad b. <br/>
Hanbal and I. al-Madlnl have adequately replied to Hisham’s accusation. </p>
<p>As to Numayr’9 accusation that he related false hadith on the authority <br/>
of unknown persons, even if his trustworthiness and honesty were not a <br/>
matter of tradition, suspicion would be divided between him and his <br/>
informants; but as we know that he is trustworthy the charge lies against <br/>
the persons unknown, not against him. Similar attacks have been made <br/>
upon SufySn al-Thauri and others whose hadith differ greatly in this way <br/>
1 This again has nothing to do with the Sira. </p>
<p>Introduction xxxix </p>
<p>and what they base on unknown informants is to be rejected while that <br/>
coming from known people is accepted. Sufyan b. 'Uyayna gave up Jarir <br/>
al-ju c fl after he had heard more than a thousand traditions from him, and <br/>
yet he narrated traditions on his authority. Shu'ba related many traditions <br/>
from him and others who were stigmatized as ‘weak’. </p>
<p>As to Ahmad’s complaint that he recorded composite traditions without <br/>
assigning the matter of them to the several contributors, their words <br/>
agreed however many they were; and even if they did not yet the meaning <br/>
was identical. There is a tradition that Wathila b. al-Asqa' said: ‘If I give <br/>
you the meaning of a tradition (not in the precise words that were used) <br/>
that is sufficient for you.’ Moreover, Muhammad b. Sirin said that he <br/>
used to hear traditions from ten different people in ten different words with <br/>
the same meaning. Ahmad’s complaint that I.I. took othef Men’s writings <br/>
and incorporated them in his own account cannot be regarded as serious <br/>
until it can be proved that he had no licence to repeat them. One must look <br/>
at the method of transmission: if the words do not plainly necessitate an <br/>
oral communication, then the accusation of tadlis 1 lies. But we ought not to <br/>
accept such a charge unless the words plainly imply that. If he expressly <br/>
says that he heard people say something when in fact he did not, that is a <br/>
downright lie and pure invention. It is quite wrong to say such a thing of <br/>
I.I. unless the words leave no other choice. 2 When Ahmad’s son quoted <br/>
his father as saying that I.I. was not to be regarded as an authority in <br/>
legal matters though he saw how tolerant he was to non-legal matters which <br/>
make up the greater part of the Maghdzi and the prophetic biography, he <br/>
applied this adverse judgement on sunan to other matters. Such an exten¬ <br/>
sion is excluded by his truthful reputation. </p>
<p>As to Yahya’s saying that he was trustworthy but not authoritative in <br/>
ega matters, it is sufficient for us that he is pronounced trustworthy. </p>
<p>If only men like al-'Umari and Malik wore acceptable there would be <br/>
precious few acceptable authorities! Yahya b. Sa'ld probably blindly <br/>
followed Malik because he heard from him wffiat Hisham had said about <br/>
I.I. His refusal to accept him as an authority in legal matters has already <br/>
been dealt with under Ahmad. Yahya made no distinction between them <br/>
and other traditions in the way of complete acceptance or dowmright <br/>
rejection. &amp; </p>
<p>Other attacks on his reputation rest on points that are not explained and <br/>
,J he part the a S ents are unfair - Even ^ legal matters Abu 'Isa <br/>
a 'I) rmid , hl and Ab0 b - Hibban (d. 3 54) accepted him as an authority. </p>
<p>. e re u ^ a ^ lon his opponents would not have been undertaken were <br/>
it not for the favourable verdict and praise that the learned gave him. <br/>
But for that a few of the charges would have sufficed to undermine his </p>
<p>unterschieben is not strictly correct. . 3 mSCh£ Nam * n </p>

<p>stories, since but a few attacks on a man’s good faith, explicit or not, are <br/>
enough to destroy the reputation of one whose former circumstances are <br/>
not known when an impartial critic has not done him justice. </p>
<p>In his book about trustworthy narrators Abu Hatim said that the two <br/>
men who attacked 1 . 1 . were Hisham and Malik. The former denied that <br/>
he had heard traditions from Fatima. But what he said does not impugn <br/>
men’s veracity in hadith, for 'followers’ like al-Aswad and Alqama heard <br/>
*A’isha’s voice without seeing her. Similarly 1 . 1 . used to hear Fatima <br/>
when the curtain was let down between them. As for Malik, what he said <br/>
was momentary and afterwards he did him justice. Nobody in the Hijaz <br/>
knew more about genealogies and wars than 1.1., and he used to say that <br/>
Malik was a freed slave of Dhu Asbah while Malik alleged that he was a <br/>
full member of the tribe so that there was bad feeling between them; and <br/>
when M5lik compiled the Muwatta' 1 . 1 . said, ‘Bring it to me for I am its <br/>
veterinary surgeon.’ Hearing of this IMalik said; He is an antichrist, he <br/>
reports traditions on the authority of the Jews. The quarrel lasted until <br/>
I.L decided to go to Iraq. Then they were reconciled and Malik gave him <br/>
50 dinars and half his date crop as a parting gift. Malik did not intend to <br/>
bring him into ill favour as a traditionist: all that he disliked was his <br/>
following the Jews who had become Muslims and learning the story of <br/>
Khaybar and Qurayza and al-Nadir and similar (otherwise) unattested <br/>
happenings from their fathers. In his Maghazi 1 . 1 . used to learn from <br/>
them but without necessarily asserting that their report was the truth. <br/>
Malik himself only relied on trustworthy truthful men. </p>
<p>The author ends by remarking that I.I. was not the originator of the <br/>
challenge to Malik’s Arab ancestry because al-Zuhri and others had said the <br/>
same thing. 1 </p>
<p>The Translation </p>
<p>I have endeavoured to follow the text as closely as possible without <br/>
sacrificing English idiom. In rendering poetry I have tried to give the sense <br/>
without making any attempt at versifying, the only exceptions being <br/>
doggerel and saj In these cases it seemed that it was fair to reproduce <br/>
doggerel by doggerel and to try to put poor rhymes into rhymes that could <br/>
not be worse. Inevitably some exactness is lost, but the general sense and <br/>
tone are more faithfully reproduced in that way. </p>
<p>The book is very long and I have made a few cuts where no loss can <br/>
result; e.g. I.H.’s recurring formula ‘This verse occurs in an ode of his’ <br/>
I have excluded because it is obvious that the line, which is generally <br/>
one of his shawdhid, cannot have stood by itself. Again I have shortened <br/>
dialogues in oratio recta into indirect speech in accordance with English <br/>
practice unless the ipsissima verba of the speaker seemed called for naturally, </p>
<p>1 For further discussion and exhaustive references to these and later writers see FUck, <br/>

<p>Introduction xli </p>
<p>or are in themselves important. Lastly I have omitted genealogical formulae <br/>
after the first mention of the people concerned. </p>
<p>My predecessors in translating the Sira have made many mistakes and <br/>
I cannot hope to have escaped all the pitfalls. Of Weil’s translation, now <br/>
nearly a century old be it remembered, Noldeke wrote 1 : ‘Die Obersetzung <br/>
von G. Weil, Stuttgart, 1864 ist steif und unbeholfen, and auch philologisch <br/>
nich mehr genugend. Die grosse Wichtigkeit des Werkes wiirde eine <br/>
neue Gbertragung rechtfertigen’; while Wellhausen’s translation of al- <br/>
Waqidi evades the difficulties of the text by silence. The poetry of the <br/>
Sira, as Noldeke said long ago of the poetry on Badr, ‘is not easy to trans¬ <br/>
late because of its many synonyms; the superficial commentary of Abu <br/>
Dharr is no help at all’. 2 </p>
<p>The Text </p>
<p>I have followed the pagination of the excellent textus receptus of Wiisten- <br/>
feld’s edition 1858-60; but the text I have actually used is the Cairo edition <br/>
of 1355/1937 produced in four parts by Mustafa al-Saqqa, Ibrahim <br/>
al-Abyari, and ‘Abdu’l-Haflz Shalabi which prints at the, bottom of the <br/>
page most of the notes from Abu Dhar*. and Suhayll that W. relegated to <br/>
the second volume of his altogether admirable edition. For this reason it is <br/>
much easier to use and its fine bold type is kind to one’s eyes. When I have <br/>
had occasion to refer to differences between the texts they are marked C. <br/>
and W. </p>
<p>THE EDITOR IBN HISHAM </p>
<p>‘Abdu’l-Malik b. Hisham was born in Basra and died at Fustat in Egypt <br/>
in 218 or 213. Krenkow, however, thinks that he must have died some years <br/>
later. 3 Besides editing the present work he made use of I.I.’s learning in his <br/>
K. al-Tijan which derives from Wahb b. Munabbih. The principles which <br/>
guided him in his impertinent meddling with his predecessor’s work he has <br/>
outlined in his Introduction, and they need not be repeated here. He was <br/>
a philologist of some repute, and he was able to air his knowledge in the <br/>
shawdhid he produces to illustrate the meaning of unusual words. These <br/>
lines, divorced as they are from their context, form some of the most <br/>
difficult of all the difficulties of the Sira and are of course for the most part <br/>
unnecessary now that the Arabs have produced lexicons of their language. <br/>
Occasionally he is helpful with his genealogical notes; more rarely he has <br/>
something useful to say about the interpretation of a line in I.I.’s work. </p>
<p>Suhayll gives some traditions which I.H. omitted or knew nothing of, <br/>
e.g. W. 183 — Suhayli 183; W. 327 = S. ii. 2 f. He also (ii. 278 = W. <br/>
824) draws attention to a mistake in one of I.H.’s notes saying that the <br/>
fault is either his or al-Bakka’i’s because Yunus has the right reading. </p>
<p>1 G.Q. 130, 2 Z.A. xxvii. 161. 3 Is. Cult. ii. 231. </p>
<p>Introduction </p>
<p>xlii The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Probably the fault lay with I.H., for he was in touch with Yunus as he says <br/>
fi ma akhharani Yunus on p. 387. </p>
<p>Another error of his is the statement that 1 . 1 . said nothing about the <br/>
mission of 'Amr b. Umayya whom the prophet sent to kill Abu Sufyan <br/>
b. fdarb and how he took down the corpse of Khubayb from the cross to <br/>
which he was tied (p. 993). T. records I.Ids version of this story which is <br/>
far superior to the garbled version of I.H., who is obviously composing a <br/>
story from more than one source, passing clumsily from the first to the <br/>
third person. According to him ‘Amr threw the cross (presumably with the <br/>
body on it) into a ravine. The cross ( khashaba , a sturdy trunk of a tree <br/>
capable of bearing a man’s body) could hardly have been moved by one <br/>
man more than a few yards with guards standing by, and I.Ids own <br/>
account is much more convincing. ‘Amr released the body from the tree, <br/>
carried it some forty paces—a graphic detail—heard the guards coming <br/>
after him, dropped the body with a thud, and made off as fast as he could. </p>
<p>There is an interesting note in S. ii. 363 which shows that I.H. s error <br/>
was perceived in early days. He adds that there is a pleasing addition to <br/>
the story in the Musnad of I. Abu Shayba to the effect that when they <br/>
untied him from the cross the earth swallowed him up. One might well <br/>
suppose that I.Hds story lies midway between the actual facts and this <br/>
incredible fiction. The unfortunate man’s body which 'Amr had made a <br/>
gallant but unavailing attempt to retrieve was dumped unceremoniously on <br/>
the ground; the next step was to give it the semblance of burial ima natural <br/>
hole in the wall of the wadi; the last step was to provide for proper burial <br/>
by a miracle. 1 </p>
<p>What remains to be explained is why I.H. should assert that 1 . 1 . had <br/>
said nothing about the abortive attempt to assassinate Abu Sufyan and the <br/>
equally Unsuccessful effort to recover Khubayb’s body. If 1 . 1 . said nothing <br/>
at all about either matter, how came it that I.H. dealt with them? Since we <br/>
know that I.I. reported what had happened from traditions that were <br/>
transmitted by ‘Amr’s own family and that they existed in oral and written <br/>
form for centuries afterwards, we cannot but suspect that I.H. has tampered <br/>
with the evidence. </p>
<p>Perhaps his greatest service is his critical observations on the authenti¬ <br/>
city of the poetry of the Sira , not only when he records that all, or some, <br/>
authorities reject certain poems altogether but also when he corrects 1.1., <br/>
and assigns verses to their true author. 2 SuyutI thought highly of him. <br/>
He reported that Abu Dharr had said that I.H. produced one of the four <br/>
compendia which were better than their sources. 3 </p>
<p>Suhayll 4 states that I.H. wrote a book explaining the difficult words in </p>
<p>1 However, it is possible that the words ghayyo.hu lldhu anhum imply, though they do not <br/>
demand, a supernatural act. </p>
<p>2 e.g. 613, where he is right in saying that Hubayra was not the author of one verse but </p>
<p>Janiib; cf. D. d. Hudhailiten, 243. 3 al-Muzhir, Cairo (n.d. recent), p. 87. </p>
<p>4 i. s&gt; He is followed by Hajji Khalifa 1012 and I. Khallikan. There is nothing said in <br/>
G.A.L. about this work. </p>
<p>xliii </p>
<p>the poetry of the Sira. Suhayli’s words indicate that he had not himself <br/>
seen the book. Were it ever found it might well tell us what I.H.’s generation <br/>
really thought about these poems. </p>
<p>A FRAGMENT OF THE LOST BOOK OF <br/>
Mt}SA B. 'UQBA </p>
<p>This fragment consists of twenty extracts complete with their isnads, <br/>
some being the sayings of the prophet on a given occasion, others being <br/>
stories from his life. The collector expressly asserts that the original work <br/>
existed in ten parts, so that the inference that the book once contained a <br/>
complete account of the Sira seems fairly safe. The last item is spurious. 1 <br/>
There is an ijaza reaching from Musa (141) to the epitomizer Abu <br/>
Hurayra b. Muhammad b. al-Naqqash (782). </p>
<ol>
<li>I. Shihab from Salim b. 'Abdullah from ‘Abdullah b. 'Umar: I heard <br/>
the apostle say, ‘While I was asleep I dreamt that I was going round the <br/>
Ka‘ba when lo a man with lank hair between the two men, his head dripping <br/>
with water. When I asked who it was they said 'Isa b. Maryam. Then <br/>
I turned away when lo a red man, heavy, with curly hair, one eyed; it <br/>
seemed as though his eye was a grape swimming (in water). When I asked <br/>
who it was they said The Antichrist. The man most like him is Ibn <br/>
Qajan al-Khuza'I.’ </li>
</ol>
<p>This tradition is similarly reported in Bukhari ii. 368. 19-369. 4. It <br/>
should be compared with I.I. 269, also from al-Zuhri, where the prophet <br/>
is said to have seen Tsa during his mi'raj, with moles or freckles on his <br/>
face appearing like drops of water. The reference here to the ‘two men’ <br/>
presumably refers to the two thieves on the cross. </p>
<ol>
<li>Ibn Shihab: The first to hold Friday prayers for the Muslims in <br/>
Medina before the apostle was Mus'ab b. 'Umayr. I. Shihab told us <br/>
another tradition from Suraqa contradicting this. </li>
</ol>
<p>The first statement agrees with I.S. in. i. 83. 25; the second apparently <br/>
with I.I. 290. 5 and I.S. in. i. 84. </p>
<ol>
<li>'Abdu’l-Rahman b. Malik b. Ju'shum al-Mudlijl from his father <br/>
Malik from his brother Suraqa b. Ju'shum: When the apostle went out <br/>
from Mecca migrating to Medina Quraysh offered a reward of 100 camels <br/>
to anyone who would bring him back, &amp;c., down to ‘my alms to the apostle’. </li>
</ol>
<p>This passage is in all essential respects the same as I.I. 331-2, though <br/>
there are many verbal differences. Obviously the version in I.I. has been <br/>
touched up and Musa gives the tradition in its simplest form. Cf. Bukhari <br/>
iii. 39, 41 and WaqidI (Wellh. 374). </p>
<p>1 See Sachau, 461 f. </p>
<p>xliv The Life of Muhammad </p>
<ol>
<li>I. Shihab alleged that 'Urwa b. al-Zubayr said that al-Zubayr met <br/>
the apostle with a caravan of Muslims who were returning to Mecca from <br/>
a trading journey to Syria. They bartered some goods with the apostle <br/>
and al-Zubayr gave him and Abu Bakr some white garments. </li>
</ol>
<p>So Bukh. iii. 40. Different names in I.S. in. i. 153. 19* </p>
<ol>
<li>Naff' from 'Abdullah b. 'Umar: Some of the apostle’s companions <br/>
said to him, 'Are you speaking to dead men ?’ He answered, You cannot <br/>
hear what I say better than they.’ </li>
</ol>
<p>So Bukh. iii. 70. 17, 18, and cf. IX, pp. 453 where the words of <br/>
'A’isha are quoted to refute the statement that the dead hear, they know </p>
<p>but they do not hear. </p>
<ol>
<li>I. Shihab from Anas b. Malik: Some Ansar asked the apostle’s <br/>
permission to remit to their sister’s son 'Abbas his ransom, and he replied, <br/>
‘No, by Allah, you shall not let him off a single farthing!’ </li>
</ol>
<p>So Bukh. iii. 69. 1,2 and cf. T. 1341, I* Qut. Ma arif 77. Sachau in <br/>
finding strange the claim to relationship between 'Abbas and the Ansar <br/>
seems to have forgotten that the grandmother of 'Abbas was Salma d. <br/>
’Amr al-Khazrajl. Cf. Bukh. ii. 388. 18 f. for the same claim. </p>
<ol>
<li>I. Shihab from 'Abdu’l-Rahman b. Ka'b b. Malik al-Sulaml and other <br/>
traditionists: 'Amir b. Malik b. Ja'far, who was called ‘the player with the <br/>
spears’, came to the apostle when he was a polytheist and the apostle <br/>
explained Islam to him and he refused to accept it. He gave the apostle <br/>
a present, but he refused it saying that he would not accept a present from <br/>
a polytheist. 'Amir said: ‘O apostle, send with me those of your messengers <br/>
you wish and I will be surety for them.’ So the apostle sent a number <br/>
among whom were al-Mundhir b. 'Amr al-Sa'idi, of whom it was said he <br/>
hastened to his death’, 1 as a spy among the Najd folk. When 'Amir b. <br/>
Tufayl heard about them he tried to call out B. ^Amir against them, but <br/>
they refused to obey him in violating the promise of security given y <br/>
'Amir b. Malik. Then he appealed to B. Sulaym and they joined him and <br/>
killed them in Bi’r Ma'una except 'Amr b. Umayya al-pamri whom <br/>
'Amir b. al-Tufayl cSptured and afterwards released. When he came to the <br/>
apostle the latter said to him, ‘Are you the sole survivor?’ </li>
</ol>
<p>This is a much briefer, account than that given in I.H. 648 f. U. 1 . <br/>
1443 f.; Waq. (Well) 337 f. </p>
<ol>
<li>Isma'Il b. Ibrahim b. 'Uqba from Salim b. 'Abdullah from 'Abdullah <br/>
b 'Umar: Some men contested the leadership of Usama, and the apostle <br/>
rose and said: ‘If you contest the leadership of Usama you used to contest <br/>
the leadership of his father before him. By Allah he was worthy to be <br/>
leader. He was one of the dearest of all men to me, and this man (his son) </li>
</ol>
<p>1 As I I. has al-Muniq liyamut I think that Sachau’s a'niq htamut, following the MS., <br/>
must be read a'ttaqa liyamut. Cf. I. al-Athir’s Nihdya (quoted by Sachau). </p>
<p>Introduction xlv </p>
<p>is one of the dearest of men to me after him; so treat him well when I am <br/>
no more, for he is one of the best of you.’ </p>
<p>Cf. Bukh. ii. 440, iii. 133, 192, and I.H. 999. 14; 1006. 20 f. </p>
<ol>
<li>Salim b. 'Abdullah from 'Abdullah b. 'Umar: The apostle used not <br/>
to make an exception for Fatima. </li>
</ol>
<p>Sachau explains this from Bukh. ii. 441 and iii. 145 where Muhammad <br/>
says that if Fatima were to steal he would cut her hand off. </p>
<ol>
<li>'Abdullah b. Fadl from Anas b. Malik: I grieved over my people <br/>
who were killed in the harra. Then Zayd b. Arqam (d. 68) wrote to me <br/>
when he heard of my great grief to say that he had heard the apostle say <br/>
‘O God forgive the Ansar and their sons and we implore Thy grace on <br/>
their grandsons’. </li>
</ol>
<p>Similarly I.H. 886. 12 and Waq. (W.) 380. </p>
<ol>
<li>'Abdullah b. al-Fadl: Some men who were with him (Anas) asked <br/>
him about Zayd b. Arqam and he said, ‘It is he of whom the apostle said, <br/>
“This is he on whom Allah has bestowed much through his ear”.’ </li>
</ol>
<p>He had been an informer, cf. I.H. 726. In place of aufa'llahu lahu <br/>
bi-udhnihi I.H. 727. 17 has aufa nlilldhi bi-udhnihi. It seems much more <br/>
likely that the variant is due to misreading than to oral tradition. Waq. <br/>
(B.M. MS. 1617, f. 95«) has wafat udhnuka . . . zva-saddaqd lldhu hadithak. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I. Shihab from Sa'id b. al-Musayyib from 'Abdullah b. Ka'b b. <br/>
Malik: The apostle said that day to Bilal, ‘Get up and announce that only a <br/>
believer will enter paradise, and that God will not support His religion by <br/>
an evil man.’ This happened when the man whom the apostle said was one <br/>
of the inhabitants of hell was mentioned. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From Nafi' b. 'Abdullah b. 'Umar: After the conquest of Khaybar <br/>
the Jews asked the apostle to let them stay there on condition that they <br/>
worked the land for half the date crop. He said: ‘We will allow you to do so <br/>
on that condition so long as we wish, and they remained there thus until <br/>
'Umar expelled them. [Here six or seven words are missing] saying ‘The <br/>
apostle laid down three things in his last disposition, viz. that the Rahawl- <br/>
yun, Dariyun, Saba’Iyun, and Ash'ariyun should have land which pro¬ <br/>
duced a hundred loads; that the mission of Usama b. Zayd should be <br/>
carried through; and that two different religions should not be allowed to <br/>
remain in the peninsula of the Arabs.’ </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Practically the same words are used in I.H. 776 except that the Saba’Iyun <br/>
are not mentioned. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Isnad as above: 'Umar used not to let Jews, Christians, and Magians <br/>
remain more than three days in Medina to do their business, and he used <br/>
to say ‘Two religions cannot subsist together’ and he exiled Jews and <br/>
Christians from the peninsula of the Arabs. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I. Shihab from 'Urwa b. al-Zubayr from Marwan b. al-Hakam and </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>xlvi The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>al-Miswar b. Makhrama: When the apostle gave men permission to free the <br/>
Hawazin captives he said, ‘I do not know who has or has not given you <br/>
permission, so go back until your leaders bring us a report of your affairs.’ <br/>
So the men returned and their leaders instructed them and they returned <br/>
to the apostle and told him that the men (Muhammad’s companions) had <br/>
treated them kindly and given them permission (to recover their captive <br/>
people). </p>
<p>For the context see I.H. 877. </p>
<p>16 . I. Shihab from Sa'id b. al-Musayyib and 'Urwa b. al-Zubayr: The <br/>
captives of Hawazin whom the apostle returned were 6,ooo men, women, <br/>
and children. He gave some women who had fallen to some men of <br/>
Quraysh—among whom were 'Abdu’l-Rahman b. 'Auf and Safwan b. <br/>
Umayya who had appropriated two women as concubines—the choice <br/>
(of returning or remaining) and they elected to go back to their own people. </p>
<p>Cf. Waq. (W.) 37S . </p>
<ol>
<li>Isma'Il b. Ibrahim b. 'Uqba from his uncle Musa b. 'Uqba from I. <br/>
Shihab: The apostle made the pilgrimage of completion in a.h. 10. He <br/>
showed the men the rites and addressed them in 'Arafa sitting on his camel <br/>
al-Jad'a. </li>
</ol>
<p>Cf. I.H. 968 and Waq. 430. </p>
<ol>
<li>I. Shihab from 'Urwa b. al-Zubayr from al-Miswar b. Makhrama <br/>
from 'Amr b. 'Auf, an ally of B. 'Amir b. Lu’ayy who had been at Badr <br/>
with the apostle: The apostle sent Abu'Ubayda b. al-Jarrah to bring the <br/>
poll tax. He had made peace with the people of al-Bahrayn and set over <br/>
them al-'Ala’ b. al-Hadraml. When Abu'Ubayda came from al-Bahrayn <br/>
with the money the Ansar heard of his coming which coincided with the <br/>
apostle’s morning prayer. When they saw him they stood in his way. <br/>
Seeing them he smiled and said: ‘I think you have heard of the coming of <br/>
Abu 'Ubayda and that he has brought something.’ When they agreed he <br/>
added: ‘Rejoice and hope for what will gladden you. By Allah it is not <br/>
poverty that I fear on your account. I fear that you will become too <br/>
comfortable and will be led astray like those before you.’ </li>
</ol>
<p>So Bukh. iii. 68. 18 f. </p>
<ol>
<li>Sa‘d b. Ibrahim from Ibrahim b. 'Abdu’l-Rahman b. 'Auf: 'Abdu’ <br/>
1 -Rahman b. 'Auf was with 'Umar one day and he (the former) broke <br/>
al-Zubayr’s sword. But God knows best who broke it. Then Abu Bakr <br/>
got up and addressed the people excusing himself and saying, ‘Never for a <br/>
moment was I eager for authority ( imdra ) nor did I v/ant it or pray to <br/>
God for it secretly or publicly. But I was afraid of disorder. I take no <br/>
pleasure in authority. I have been invested with a grave matter for which <br/>
I have not the strength and can only cope with it if God gives me the <br/>
strength. I would that he who has the most strength for it were in my <br/>
place.’ The emigrants accepted his excuse and Ali and al-Zubayr b. </li>
</ol>
<p>Introduction xl v ;{ </p>
<p>al- A warn said :‘We were angry only because we were not admitted to the <br/>
council and we think that Abu Bakr is the most worthy of supreme <br/>
authority now that the apostle is dead. He was the one with the apostle in <br/>
the cave and we recognize his dignity and seniority; and the apostle put <br/>
him in charge of the prayers while he was still with us.’ </p>
<p>A few comments on this brief anthology will not be out of place here. <br/>
No. 12 clearly deals with the vexed question of the future state of the <br/>
wicked Muslim, while No. 18 is a post eventum prophecy. Inevitably they <br/>
arouse doubt in the mind of the reader. </p>
<p>From this selection as a whole we can see where the sympathies of the <br/>
collector lay. Thus, al-Zubayr’s generosity to Muhammad and Abu <br/>
Bakr are recorded in No. 4. The claims of the Alides to special considera¬ <br/>
tion are brushed aside in No. 9; while No. 19 states that 'All explicitly <br/>
accepted Abu Bakr as Muhammad’s successor. No. 6 shows that al-'Abbas <br/>
had to pay his ransom in full even when the Ansar pleaded for his exemp¬ <br/>
tion. No. 10 mourns the victims of the Umayyads at al-Harra and records <br/>
that the prophet implored God’s blessing on them and their grandchildren. </p>
<p>Clearly Musa’s sympathies lay with the family of al-Zubayr and the <br/>
Ansar. They alone emerge with credit. The Alids, on the other hand, <br/>
are no better than anyone else; the Umayyads are implicitly condemned <br/>
for the slaughter at al-Harra; and al- Abbas is shown to have been a rebel <br/>
against the prophet who was forced to pay for his opposition to him to the <br/>
uttermost farthing. </p>
<p>Musa b. 'Uqba has said pretty much the same on the subject of the <br/>
Ansar and al-'Abbas as I.I. said before his editor I.H. pruned his work, <br/>
though he took a different view of the Alides. 1 </p>

<p>MUHAMMAD’S PURE DESCENT <br/>
FROM ADAM </p>
<p>Abu Muhammad 'Abdu’l-Malik ibn Hisham the Grammarian said: </p>
<p>This is the book of the biography of the apostle of God. </p>
<p>Muhammad was the son of 'Abdullah, b. 'Abdu’l-Mu^talib (whose name <br/>
was Shayba), b. Hashim (whose name was <em>Amr), b. 'Abdu Manaf (whose <br/>
name was al-Mughlra), b. Qusayy (whose name was Zayd), b. Kilab, b. <br/>
Murra, b. Ka'b, b. Lu’ayy, b. Ghalib, b. Fihr, b. Malik, b. al-Nadr, b. <br/>
Kinana, b. Khuzayma, b. Mudrika (whose name was 'Amir), b. IlySs, <br/>
b. Mudar, b. Nizar, b. Ma'add, b. 'Adnan, b. Udd (or Udad), b.Muqaw- <br/>
wam, b. Nahur, b. Tayrah, b. Ya'rub, b. Yashjub, b. Nabit, b. Isma'il, <br/>
b. Ibrahim, the friend of the Compassionate, b. Tarih (who is Azar), <br/>
b. Nahur, b. Sarugh, b. Ra'u, b. Falikh, h. ' Aybar r b. Shalikh, b. Arfakh- <br/>
shadh, b. Sam, b. Nuh, b. Lamk, b. Mattushalakh, b. Akhnukh, who is the <br/>
prophet Idris according to what they allege, 2 but God knows best (he was <br/>
the first of the sons of Adam to whom prophecy and writing with a pen were <br/>
given), b. Yard, b. Mahlil, b. Qaynan, b. Yanish, b. Shith, b. Adam (io).</em> </p>
<p>THE LINE OF ISMA'lL </p>
<p>Isma'il b. Ibrahim begat twelve sons: Nabit the eldest, Qaydhar, Adhbul, <br/>
Mabsha, Misma', Mashi, Dimma, Adhr, Tayma, Yatur, Nabish, Qayd- <br/>
huma. Their mother was Ra'la d. Mudad b. r Amr al-Jurhumi (n). <br/>
Jurhum was the son of Yaqtan b. 'Aybar b. Shalikh, and [Yaqtan was] 3 <br/>
Qahtan b. 'Aybar b. Shalikh. According to report Isma'il lived 130 years, </p>
<p>1 The formula of blessing which follows every mention of the prophet is omitted here¬ <br/>
after. Capital B, stands for ‘Sons of*; b. for ‘son of’; d. for ‘daughter of’. </p>
<p>2 The phrase employed indicates that the writer doubts the statement. There is a saying <br/>
in Arabic: ‘There is a euphemism for everything and the polite way of saying “It’s a lie” is <br/>
“they allege” (za 'amu)'. </p>
<p>3 These words are added by C, as the context demands. </p>

<p>4 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>5 and when he died he was buried in the sacred precincts 1 of the Ka'ba <br/>
beside his mother Hagar (12). </p>
<p>Muhammad b. Muslim b. 'Ubaydullah b. Shihab al-Zuhrl told me <br/>
that 'Abdu’l-Rahman b. 'Abdullah b. Ka'b b. Malik al-Ansari, also called <br/>
al-Sulami, told him that the apostle of God said: ‘When you conquer <br/>
Egypt treat its people well, for they can claim our protection and kinship. </p>
<p>I asked al-Zuhri what the apostle meant by making them our kin and he <br/>
replied that Hagar, the mother of Ismail, was of their stock (13). </p>
<p>*Ad b. 'Au? b. Iram b. Sam b. Nuh and Thamud and Jadls the two sons <br/>
of 'Abirb. Iram b. Sam b. Nuh, andTasm and Tmlaq and Umaym the sons <br/>
of Lawidh b. Sam b. Nuh are all Arabs. Nabit b. Ismail begat Yashjub </p>
<p>and the line runs: Ya'rub-Tayrah-Nahur-Muqawwam-Udad-‘Adnan (14). </p>
<p>From 'Adnan the tribes descended from Isma'Il split off. 'Adnan had <br/>
6, 7 two sons, Ma'add and 'Akk (14). Ma'add had four sons: Nizar, Quda'a <br/>
(he being his first born he was called Abu Quda a), Qunus, and^ Iy 3 . <br/>
Quda'a went to the Yaman to Himyar b. Saba whose name was 'Abdu <br/>
Shams ■, the reason why he was called Saba’ was that he was the first among <br/>
the Arabs to take captives. He was the son of Yashjub b. Ya rub b. <br/>
Qahtan (15). Of Qunus b. Ma'add according to the genealogists of <br/>
Ma'add, none has survived. Al-Nu'man b. al-Mundhir king of al-IIIra <br/>
belonged to their tribe. Al-Zuhri told me that this Nu'mSn belonged to the <br/>
Qunus b. Ma'add (16). </p>
<p>Ya'qub b. 'Utba b. al-Mughlra b. al-Akhnas told me that a shaykh of the <br/>
Ansar of B. Zurayq told him that 'Umar b. al-Khattab, when he was given <br/>
the’ sword of al-Nu'man b. al-Mundhir, sent for Jubayr b. Maf im b. <br/>
'Adly b. Naufal b. 'Abdu Manaf b. Qusayy (he being the best genealogist <br/>
of the Qunaysh and indeed of all the Arabs and claimed to have been <br/>
taught by Abu Bakr who was the greatest genealogist of the Arabs) and <br/>
girded it on him. When he asked who al-Nu'man was, Jubayr replied that <br/>
he was a survivor of the tribe of Qunus b. Ma add. However, the rest of the <br/>
Arabs assert that he belonged to the Lakhm of the Rabi'a b. Nasr. Only <br/>
God knows the truth (17). </p>
<p>9 OF RABi'A B. NASR KING OF THE YAMAN AND THE </p>
<p>STORY OF SHIQQ AND SAJIIJ THE TWO SOOTHSAYERS </p>
<p>Rabi'a b. Nasr, king of the Yaman, was of the true stock of the Tubba' <br/>
kings. He had a vision which terrified him and continued to cause him <br/>
10 much anxiety. So he summoned every soothsayer, sorcerer, omenmonger, <br/>
and astrologer in his kingdom and said: ‘I have had a vision which terrifies <br/>
me and is a source of anxiety. Tell me what it was and what it means. <br/>
They replied: ‘Tell us the vision and we will tell you its meaning.’ ‘If <br/>
I tell you it,’ said he, ‘I can have no confidence in your interpretation; for </p>
<p>1 The hijr is the semicircular space between the hafim (wall) and the Ka ba. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 5 </p>
<p>the only man who knows its meaning is he who knows about the vision <br/>
without my telling him.’ Thereupon one of them recommended him to <br/>
send for Shiqq and Satlh, for they knew more than others and would be <br/>
able to answer his questions. Satih’s name was Rabl' b. Rabi'a b. Mas'ud b. <br/>
Mazin, b. Dhi’b b. 'Adly b. Mazin Ghassan. Shiqq w T as the son of Sa'b, <br/>
b. Yashkur b. Ruhm b. Afrak, b. Qasr b. 'Abqar b. Anmar b. Nizar, and <br/>
Anmar was the father of Bajlla and Khath 'am (18). </p>
<p>So he sent for them and Satlh arrived first. The king then repeated his <br/>
words, ending, ‘If you know the vision you will know what it means.’ <br/>
Salih replied [in saf ]: </p>
<p>A fire you did see <br/>
Come forth from the sea. </p>
<p>It fell on the low country <br/>
And devoured all that be. </p>
<p>The king agreed that this was exactly what he had seen, and what was <br/>
the meaning of it all ? He answered: </p>
<p>By the serpent of the lava plains I swear <br/>
The Ethiopians on your land shall bear <br/>
Ruling from Abyan to Jurash everywhere. </p>
<p>The king exclaimed that this was distressing news, but when would these <br/>
things come to pass—in his time or after him? He replied: [again in <br/>
rhyme] that more than sixty or seventy years must first pass. Would the <br/>
new-comers’ kingdom last? No, an end would be put to it after seventy <br/>
years or more; then they would be slain or driven out as fugitives. Who <br/>
would do this? Iram b. Dhu Yazan, who would come against them from <br/>
Aden and not leave one of them in the Yemen. Further questions drew <br/>
the information that their kingdom would not last, but a pure prophet to <br/>
whom revelation came from on high would bring it to an end; he would be <br/>
a man of the sons of Ghalib b. Fihr b. Malik, b. al-Nadr. His dominion <br/>
would last to the end of time. Has time an end? asked the king. Yes, <br/>
replied Salih, the day on which the first and the last shall be assembled, <br/>
the righteous for happiness, the evildoers for misery. Are you telling me <br/>
the truth? the king asked. </p>
<p>Yes, by the dark and the twilight <br/>
And the dawn that follows the night <br/>
Verily what I have told you is right. </p>
<p>Later Shiqq arrived and the king acquainted him with the facts but <br/>
did not tell him what Satlh had said, so that he might see whether they <br/>
agreed or differed. His words were: </p>
<p>A fire you did see <br/>
Come forth from the sea. </p>
<p>It fell between rock and tree <br/>
Devouring all that did breathe. </p>
<p>6 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Perceiving that they agreed one with the other and that the difference <br/>
was a mere choice of words, the king asked Shiqq for his interpretation: </p>
<p>By the men of the plains I swear <br/>
The blacks on your land shall bear <br/>
Pluck your little ones from your care <br/>
Ruling from Abyan to Najran everywhere. </p>
<p>The king put the same questions to him and learned that after his time: <br/>
There shall deliver you from them one mighty, great of name <br/>
And put them to the utmost shame. </p>
<p>He would be: </p>
<p>A young man neither remiss nor base </p>
<p>Coming forth from Dhu Yazan’s house, his place, </p>
<p>Not one of them shall leave on Yaman’s face. </p>
<p>He continued in answer to the questions already put to his predecessor. <br/>
His kingdom shall be ended by an apostle who will bring truth and justice <br/>
among men of religion and virtue. Dominion will rest among his people <br/>
until the Day of Separation, the day on which those near God will be <br/>
rewarded, on which demands from heaven will be made which the quick <br/>
and dead will hear, men will be gathered at the appointed place, the God- <br/>
12 fearing to receive salvation and blessing. By the Lord of heaven and earth, <br/>
and what lies between them high or low I have told you but the truth in <br/>
which no doubt ( ami ) lies (19). </p>
<p>What these tw T o men said made a deep impression on RabI a b. Nasr and <br/>
he dispatched his sons and family to Iraq with all that they might need, <br/>
giving them a letter to the Persian king Sabur b. Khurrazadh who let them <br/>
settle in al-Hlra. </p>

<p>HOW ABti KARIB TIBAN AS'AD TOOK POSSESSION OF THE <br/>
KINGDOM OF THE YAMAN AND HIS EXPEDITION <br/>
TO YATHRIB </p>
<p>When Rabi r a b. Nasr died the whole kingdom of the Yaman fell into the <br/>
hands of Hassan b. Tiban As'ad Abu Karib. (Tiban As'ad was the last <br/>
Tubba', the son of Kuli Karib b. Zayd, Zayd being the first Tubba' son <br/>
of 'Amr Dhu-l-Adh 'ar b. Abraha Dhu-l-Manar b. al-Rish (21) b. 'Adiy b. <br/>

latter is IJimyar b. Saba’al-Akbar b. Ya'rub b. Yashjub b. Qahfan (22).) </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 7 </p>
<p>It was Tiban As'ad Abu Karib who w ent to Medina and took away to the <br/>
Yaman two Jewish rabbis from thence. He adorned 1 the sacred temple and <br/>
covered it with cloth. His reign was before that of Rabi'a b. Nasr (23). 13 </p>
<p>When he came from the east he had passed by Medina without harming <br/>
its people; but he left behind there one of his sons wLo w r as treacherously <br/>
slain. Thereupon he returned with the intention of destroying the <br/>
town and exterminating its people and cutting down its palms. So this <br/>
tribe of the Ansar gathered together under the leadership of 'Amr b. <br/>
Talla the brother of B. al-Najjar and one of B. 'Amr b. Mabdhul. Mab- <br/>
dhul’s name was 'Amir b. Malik b. al-Najjar; and al-Najjar’s name was <br/>
Taym Allah b. Tha'laba b. 'Amr b. al-Khazraj b. Haritha b. Tha'laba b. <br/>
'Amr b. 'Amir (24). </p>
<p>Now a man of B. 'Adiy b. al-Najjar called Ahmar had fallen upon one <br/>
of the followers of Tubba' when he brought them to Medina and killed <br/>
him, 2 because he caught him among his palms cutting the date clusters; <br/>
he struck him with his sickle and killed him, saying ‘The fruit belongs to <br/>
the man who cultivates it.’ This enraged the Tubba' against them and <br/>
fighting broke out. Indeed the Ansar assert that they used to fight them by <br/>
day and treat them as guests by night. Tubba' was amazed at this and used <br/>
to say: ‘By God our people are generous!’ </p>
<p>While Tubba' was occupied in this fighting there came two Jewish <br/>
rabbis from B. Qurayza—Qurayza, and al~Nadir and al-Najjam and 'Amr <br/>
nicknamed Hanging-lip w r ere sons of al-Khazraj b. al-Sarih b. al-Tau’aman <br/>
b. al-Sibt b. al-Yasa' b. Sa'd b. Law! b. Khayr b. al-Najjam b. Tanhum b. <br/>
'Azar b. Tzra b. Harun b. 'Imran b. Yashar b. Qahat 3 b. Lawl b. Ya'qub <br/>
otherwise called Isra’ll b. Ishaq b. Ibrahim the friend of al-Rahman— <br/>
learned men well grounded in tradition. They had heard about the king’s <br/>
intention to destroy the town and its people and they said to him: ‘O <br/>
King, do not do it, for if you persist in your intention something will <br/>
happen to prevent your carrying it out and we fear that you will incur <br/>
speedy retribution.’ When the king asked the reason for this they told <br/>
him that Yathrib was the place to which a prophet of the Quraysh w r ould <br/>
migrate in time to come, and it would be his home and resting-place. 14 <br/>
Seeing that these men had hidden knowledge the king took their words in <br/>
good part and gave up his design, departed from Medina and embraced <br/>
the rabbis’ religion. 4 </p>
<p>Khalid b. 'Abd al-'Uzza b. Ghazlya b. 'Amr b. 'Auf b. Ghunm b. <br/>
Malik b. al-Najjar boasting of 'Amr b. Talla said: </p>
<p>Has he given up youthful folly or ceased to remember it ? </p>
<p>Or has he had his fill of pleasure ? </p>
<p>1 *ammara perhaps means ‘restored’. Tab. omits this sentence. </p>
<p>2 adds: ‘and threw him into a well called Dhat Tuman’. </p>
<p>3 Variant Qahath. </p>

Anas b, Malik to certain shaykhs of Medina who lived in pre-Islamic times. </li>

<p>Or have you remembered youth ? </p>
<p>And what a memory of youth and its times you have! </p>
<p>It was a young man’s war <br/>

<p>When headlong 1 with the morning star came <br/>
Abu Karib with his great squadrons <br/>
Clad in long mail, of pungent smell. </p>
<p>They said, Whom shall we make for, </p>

<p>Surely the Banu-l-Najjar, </p>
<p>For we seek revenge for our dead. </p>
<p>Then our swordsmen 2 went to meet them, </p>
<p>Their number as the drops of widely falling rain, </p>

<p>A chief who is on a level with kings but whoso <br/>
Would vie with him does not know his eminence. </p>
<p>This tribe of the An?ar claim that the Tubba* was enraged only against <br/>
this tribe of the Jews who were living among them and that it was only <br/>
his intention to destroy them, but they protected them until he went his <br/>
way. Therefore in his verse he said: </p>
<p>In rage against two Jewish tribes who live in Yathrib <br/>
Who richly deserve the punishment of a fateful day (25). 3 </p>
<p>Now the Tubba' and his people were idolaters. He set out for Mecca <br/>
which was on his way to the Yaman, and when he was between ‘Usfan and <br/>
15 Amaj 4 some men of the Hudhayl b. Mudrika b. Ilyas b. Mudar b. Nizar b. <br/>
Ma'add came to him saying, ‘O King, may we not lead you to an ancient <br/>
treasury which former kings have overlooked ? It contains pearls, topaz, <br/>
rubies, gold, and silver.’ Certainly, said he, and they added that it was a <br/>
temple in Mecca which its people worshipped and where they prayed. But <br/>
the real intention of the Hudhaylls was to encompass his destruction, for <br/>
they knew that any king that treated it with disrespect was sure to die. <br/>
Having agreed to their proposal he sent to the two rabbis and asked their <br/>
opinion. They told him that the sole object of the tribe was to destroy <br/>
him and his army. ‘We know of no other temple in the land which God <br/>
has chosen for Himself, said they, and if you do what they suggest you and <br/>
all your men will perish.’ The king asked them what he should do when <br/>
he got there, and they told him to do what the people of Mecca did: to </p>

<p>circumambulate the temple, to venerate and honour it, to shave his head, <br/>
and to behave with all humility until he had left its precincts. </p>
<p>The king asked why they too should not do likewise. They replied that <br/>
it was indeed the temple of their father Abraham, but the idols wliich the <br/>
inhabitants had set up round it, and the blood which they shed there, <br/>
presented an insuperable obstacle. They are unclean polytheists, said they <br/>
—or words to that effect. </p>
<p>Recognizing the soundness and truth of their words the king summoned <br/>
the men from the Hudhayl and cut off their hands and feet, and continued <br/>
his journey to Mecca. He went round the Ka'ba, sacrificed, and shaved <br/>
his head, staying there six days (so they say) sacrificing animals which he <br/>
distributed to the people and giving them honey to drink. </p>
<p>It was revealed to him in a dream that he should cover the temple, so <br/>
he covered it with woven palm branches; a later vision showed him that he <br/>
must do better so he covered it with YamanI cloth; a third vision induced <br/>
him to clothe it with fine striped Yaman cloth. People say that the Tubba' <br/>
was the first man to cover the temple in this way. He ordered its JurhumI <br/>
guardians to keep it clean and not to allow blood, dead bodies, or men- <br/>
struous cloths to come near it, and he made a door and a key for it. </p>

forbidding him to commit grievous sin there, she reminded him of Tubba* <br/>
and his humility towards it and his work there, in the following lines: </p>
<p>O my son, oppress neither the mean nor the great in Mecca. </p>
<p>Preserve its sanctity and be not led away. 1 </p>
<p>He who does evil in Mecca will meet the worst misfortune. </p>
<p>His face will be smitten and his cheeks will burn with fire. </p>
<p>I know from certain knowledge that the evildoer there will perish. </p>
<p>God has made it inviolate though no castles are built in its court. </p>
<p>God has made its birds inviolate and the wild goats on Thabir 2 are safe. </p>
<p>Tubba' came against it, but covered its building with embroidered <br/>
cloth. </p>
<p>God humbled his sovereignty there so he fulfilled his vows, </p>
<p>Walking barefoot to it with two thousand camels in its courtyard. </p>
<p>Its people he fed with the flesh of Mahri camels. </p>

<p>*7 Afterwards he set forth for the Yaman with his army and the two rabbis, <br/>
and when he reached his own country he invited his people to adopt his <br/>
new religion, but they refused until the matter could be tested by the <br/>
ordeal of fire which was there. </p>
<p>Abu Malik b. Tha'laba b. Abu Malik al-Qurazi told me that he heard <br/>
Ibrahim b. Muhammad b. Talha b. 'Ubaydallah narrate that when Tubba* <br/>
drew near to the Yaman the Himyarites blocked his path, refusing to <br/>
let him pass because he had abandoned their religion. When he invited <br/>
them to accept his religion on the ground that it was better than theirs, <br/>
they proposed that the matter should be subject to the ordeal by fire. <br/>
The Yamanites say that a fire used to settle matters in dispute among them <br/>
by consuming the guilty and letting the innocent go scatheless. 1 So his <br/>
people went forth with their idols and sacred objects, and the two rabbis <br/>
went forth with their sacred books 2 hanging like necklaces from their <br/>
necks until they halted at the place whence the fire used to blaze out. On <br/>
this occasion when it came out the Yamanites withdrew in terror, but their <br/>
followers encouraged them and urged them to stand fast, so they held their <br/>
ground until the fire covered them and consumed their idols and sacred <br/>
objects and the men w r ho bore them. But the two rabbis came out with <br/>
their sacred books, sweating profusely but otherwise unharmed. There¬ <br/>
upon the Himyarites accepted the king’s religion. Such was the origin of <br/>
Judaism in the Yaman. </p>
<p>Another informant told me that the two parties only went up to the <br/>
fire to drive it back, for it was held that the one who succeeded in driving <br/>
it back was most worthy of credence. When the Himyarites with their <br/>
idols came near to drive the fire back, the fire came out against them and they <br/>
withdrew unable to withstand it. Afterwards, when the two rabbis came <br/>
reciting the Torah, the fire receded so that they drove it back to the place <br/>
from which it had emerged. Thereupon the Himyarites accepted their <br/>
religion. But God knows which report is correct. </p>
<p>18 Now Ri’am was one of the temples which they venerated and where <br/>
they offered sacrifices and received oracles when they were polytheists. <br/>
The two rabbis told Tubba* that it was merely a shaytan which deceived <br/>
them in this way and they asked to be allowed to deal with it. When the <br/>
king agreed they commanded a black dog to come out of it and killed it— </p>
<p>pp. 29 f. W.’s reading ‘They shot great stones into it’ probably refers to the siege when <br/>
al-I^ajjaj bombarded Mecca, The contrast between his violence and the humility of Tubba' <br/>
is hinted at in the last line. </p>

Arabs of Sinai see Austin Kennett, Bedouin Justice, Cambridge, 1925, pp. 107-14. </p>

<p>at least this is what the Yamanites say. Then they destroyed the temple and </p>
<p>1 am told that its rums to this day show’ traces of the blood that was poured <br/>
over it. r </p>
<p>(T. Tubba* composed the following lines about his expedition, what he T 006 <br/>
had intended to do with Medina and the Ka'ba, what he actually did to the <br/>
men of Hudhayl, and how he adorned and purified the temple and what <br/>
the two rabbis told him about the apostle of God: </p>
<p>Why, O soul, is thy sleep disturbed like one whose eyes pain him ? </p>
<p>Why dost thou suffer from perpetual insomnia, </p>
<p>Enraged against two Jewish tribes who live in Yathrib, </p>
<p>Who richly deserve the punishment of a fateful day ? </p>
<p>When I sojourned in Medina <br/>
Calm and refreshing was my sleep. </p>
<p>I made my dwelling on a hill <br/>
Between al-'Aqlq and BaqI' ul-Gharqad. </p>
<p>We left its rocks and plateau </p>
<p>And its bare salty plain </p>
<p>And came down to Yathrib, and my breast </p>
<p>Seethed with anger at the killing of my son. </p>
<p>I had sworn a steadfast vow, </p>
<p>An oath full strong and binding. </p>
<p>If I reach Yathrib I will leave it <br/>
Stripped of palms both striplings and fruitful’ </p>
<p>When lo from Qurayza came <br/>
A rabbi wise, among the Jews respected. </p>
<p>‘Stand back from a city preserved;’ said he, </p>
<p>For Mecca’s prophet of Quraysh true-guided.’ </p>
<p>So I forgave them without reproach </p>
<p>I left them to the judgement of the last day </p>
<p>To God whose pardon I hope for </p>
<p>On the day of reckoning that I escape the flames of hell. </p>
<p>Some of our people I left there for him, </p>
<p>Men of reputation and valour, </p>
<p>Men who carry plans to victory’s end. </p>
<p>I hope thereby for a reward from Muhammad’s Lord. </p>
<p>I knew not that there was a pure temple <br/>
Devoted to God in Mecca’s vale, </p>
<p>Till slaves from Hudhayl came to me <br/>
In al-Duff of Jumdan above al-Masnad. </p>
<p>‘A house of ancient wealth in Mecca <br/>
Treasures of pearls and jewels!’ they said. </p>
<p>I wanted to seize them but my Lord said nay. </p>
<p>For God prevents destruction of his sanctuary. </p>
<p>I gave up my purpose there </p>

<p>And left those men an example to the discerning. <br/>

<p>THE REIGN OF HIS SON HASSAN IBN TIBAN AND HOW <br/>
'AMR killed his brother </p>
<p>When his son Hassan b. Tiban As’ad Abu Karib came to the throne he <br/>
set out with the Yamanites to subdue the land of the Arabs an ersia " s . <br/>
However when they reached a place in Iraq (27) the H.myante and <br/>
Yamanite tribes were unwilling to go farther and wanted to return to then <br/>
S soTeylpproached one of his brothers called 'tor who was w. h <br/>
“’the aA^d said that if he would kill hrs brother-they wouW <br/>
make him king so that he might lead them home agam He said that he <br/>
would do so, and they all agreed to join in the plot except Dhu Ru ayr1 the <br/>
Himyarite. He forbade him to do this, but he would not heed, so Dhu <br/>
Ru'ayn wrote the following verses: </p>
<p>Oh who would buy sleeplessness for sleep ? </p>
<p>Happy is he who passes the night in peace; </p>
<p>Though ITimyar have been treacherous, </p>
<p>God will hold Dhu Ru'ayn blameless. </p>
<p>He sealed the document and brought it to paying:'Keep this with <br/>
vou for me’ and he did so. Then 'Amr killed his brother Hassan ana <br/>
returned to’the Yaman with his men. 2 One of the Himyar.tes was moved </p>
<p>to say: </p>
<p>In former generations </p>
<p>What eyes have seen </p>
<p>The like of Ifass&amp;n who has been slain I </p>
<p>The princes slew him lest they should be kept at war. </p>

<p>Take the kingdom without using force. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 13 </p>
<p>The words ‘lababi lababi’ mean ‘no matter’ in the Himyarl language (28). </p>
<p>When Amr b. Tiban returned to the Yaman he could not sleep and J 9 <br/>
insomnia took a firm hold of him. Being much concerned at this, he asked <br/>
the physicians and those of the soothsayers and diviners who were seers <br/>
about his trouble. One of them said: ‘No man has ever killed his brother or <br/>
kinsman treacherously as you killed your brother without losing his sleep <br/>
and becoming a prey to insomnia.’ At this he began to kill all the nobles <br/>
who had urged him to murder his brother Hassan, till finally he came to <br/>
Dhu Ru'ayn who claimed that 'Amr held the proof of his innocence, <br/>
namely the paper which he had given him. He had it brought to him and <br/>
when he had read the two verses he let him go, recognizing that he had <br/>
given him good counsel. 1 When 'Amr died the Himyarite kingdom fell <br/>
into disorder and the people split up into parties. </p>
<p>HOW lakhni'a dhu shanatir seized the throne of </p>
<p>THE YAMAN </p>
<p>A Himyarl who had no connexion with the royal house called Lakhni'a <br/>
Yanuf Dhu Shanatir 2 arose and killed off their leading men and put the <br/>
royal family to open shame. Of this man a certain Himyarl recited: </p>
<p>Himyar was slaying its sons and exiling its princes, </p>
<p>Working its shame with its own hands, </p>
<p>Destroying its worldly prosperity with frivolous thoughts. </p>
<p>Even greater was the loss of their religion. </p>
<p>So did earlier generations bring their doom <br/>
By acts of injustice and profligacy. </p>
<p>Lakhni'a was a most evil man—a sodomite. He used to summon a <br/>
young man of the royal family and assault him in a room which he had <br/>
constructed for this very purpose, so that he could not reign after him. <br/>
Then he used to go from this upper chamber of his to his guards and <br/>
soldiers, (who were below) having put a toothpick in his mouth to let them <br/>
know that he had accomplished his purpose. (T. Then he would release <br/>
him and he would appear before the guards and the people utterly dis¬ <br/>
graced.) One day he sent for Zur'a Dhu Nuwas son of Tiban As'ad <br/>
brother of Hassan. He was a little boy when Hassan was murdered and had <br/>
become a fine handsome young man of character and intelligence. When <br/>
the messenger came he perceived what was intended and took a fine sharp <br/>
knife and hid it under the sole of his foot and went to Lakhni'a. As soon 20 <br/>
as they were alone he attacked him and Dhu Nuwas rushed upon him and <br/>
stabbed him to death. He then cut off his head and put it in the window </p>
<p>1 Tab, 916 f. contains a long poem ascribed to 'Amr. </p>
<p>1 N 61 d., Gtsch, d. Perser u. Araber, 173, notes that the name Lakhl'atha occurs in inscrip¬ <br/>

<p>which overlooked the men below. He stuck the toothpick in his mouth <br/>
aud went out to the guards, who in coarse language inquired what had <br/>
happened. 1 'Ask that head,’ he replied. They looked at fhe wrndow and <br/>
there was Lakhni'a’s head cut off. So they went in pursuit of Dhu Nuwas <br/>
and said: ‘You must be our king and no one else, seeing that you ave n <br/>
us of this disgusting fellow.’ (29). </p>

<p>They made him king and all the tribes of Himyar joined him. He was the <br/>

called Toseph and reigned for some considerable time. , T _ , </p>
<p>In Najran there were some people 1 who held the religion 0 i? ’ <br/>
Maryam, a virtuous and upright people who followed the Gospel. Their <br/>
head^was named ‘Abdullah b. al-Thamir. The place where that^ eligton <br/>
took root was in Najran, at that time the centre of the Arabs cou t y, <br/>
people, and indeed the rest of the Arabs, were idola e 4 hi </p>
<p>the name of Faymiyun had settled there and converted the people to his </p>
<p>religion. </p>
<p>THE BEGINNING OF CHRISTIANITY IN NAJRAN </p>
<p>Al-Mughlra b. Abu Labld, a freedman of al-Akhnas, on the authority of <br/>
Wahb b. Munabbih the Yamani told me that the origin of Christianity m <br/>
Najrto was due to a man named Faymiyun who was a righteous, earnest <br/>
ascetic man whose prayers were answered. He used to wander between <br/>
towns- as soon as he became known in one town he moved to another, <br/>
eating only what he earned, for he was a builder by trade using <br/>
h' JLd to keep Sunday as a day of rest and would do no work then He <br/>
used To go into a desert place and pray there until the evening Whik he <br/>
Ts following his trade in a Syrian village withdrawing himself from men <br/>
one of the people there called Salih perceived what manner of man <br/>
was and felt a violent affection for him, so that unperceived by Faymiyun <br/>
Re used to follow him from place to place, until one Sunday he went as <br/>
his wont was out into the desert followed by Salih. Salih chose a hidmg- <br/>
niacl and sat down where he could see him, not wanting him to know where <br/>
he was. As Faymiyun stood to pray a tmnin, a seven-horned snake, ca </p>

<p>towards him and when Faymiyun saw it he cursed it and it died. Seeing <br/>
the snake but not knowing what had happened to it and fearing for <br/>
Faymiyun’s safety, Salih could not contain himself and cried out: ‘Faymi¬ <br/>
yun, a tinnln is upon you!’ He took no notice and went on with his prayers <br/>
until he had ended them. Night had come and he departed. He knew <br/>
that he had been recognized and Salih knew that he had seen him. So he <br/>
said to him: ‘Faymiyun, you know that I have never loved anything as <br/>
I love you; I want to be always with you and go wherever you go.’ He <br/>
replied: ‘As you will. You know how I live and if you feel that you can <br/>
bear the life well and good.’ So Salih remained with him, and the people <br/>
of the village were on the point of discovering his secret. For when a man <br/>
suffering from a disease came in his way by chance he prayed for him and he <br/>
was cured; but if he was summoned to a sick man he would not go. Now <br/>
one of the villagers had a son who was blind 1 and he asked about Faymiyun <br/>
and was told that he never came when he was sent for, but that he was a <br/>
man who built houses for people for a wage. Thereupon the man took his <br/>
son and put him in his room and threw a garment over him and went to <br/>
Faymiyun saying that he wanted him to do some work for him in his house <br/>
and would he come and look at it, and they would agree on a price. <br/>
Arrived at the house Faymiyun asked what he wanted done, and after <br/>
giving details the man suddenly whisked off the covering from the boy <br/>
and said: ‘O Faymiyun, one of God’s creatures is in the state you see. 22 <br/>
So pray for him.’ Faymiyun did so 2 and the boy got up entirely healed. <br/>
Knowing that he had been recognized, he left the village followed by <br/>
Salih, and while they were walking through Syria they passed by a great <br/>
tree and a man called fro hi it saying, ‘I’ve been expecting you and saying, <br/>
“When is he coming?” until I heard your voice and knew it y was you. <br/>
Don’t go until you have prayed over my grave for I am about to die.’ He <br/>
did die and he prayed over him until they buried him. Then he left <br/>
followed by Salih until they reached the land of the Arabs who attacked <br/>
them, and a caravan carried them off and sold them in Najran. At this time <br/>
the people of Najran followed the religion of the Arabs worshipping a great <br/>
palm-tree there. Every year they had a festival when they hung on the <br/>
tree any fine garment they could find and women’s jewels. Then they <br/>
sallied out and devoted the day to it. 3 Faymiyun was sold to one noble and <br/>
Salih to another. Now it happened that when Faymiyun was praying <br/>
earnestly at night in a house which his master had assigned to him the <br/>
whole house was filled with light so that it shone as it were without a lamp. </p>
<p>His master was amazed at the sight, and asked him about his religion. <br/>
Faymiyun told him and said that they were in error; as for the palm-tree <br/>
it could neither help nor hurt; and if he were to curse the tree in the name </p>
<p>1 Or ‘sick’. </p>
<p>2 T- gives the words of Faymiyun’s prayer: 'O God, thy enemy has attacked the health of <br/>
one of thy servants to ruin it. Restore him to health and protect him from him.’ </p>
<p>3 Or, perhaps, ‘processed round it’. </p>
<p>j5 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>of God He would destroy it, for He was God Alone without companion. <br/>
‘Then do so,’ said his master, ‘for if you do that we shall embrace your <br/>
religion, and abandon our present faith.’ After purifying himself an <br/>
performing two rak'as, he invoked God against the tree and God sent a <br/>
wind against it which tore it from its roots and cast it on the ground. 1 hen <br/>
the people of Najran adopted his religion and he instructed them m the <br/>
law of 'Isa b. Maryam. Afterwards they sulfered the misfortunes which <br/>
befell their co-religionists in every land. This was the origin of Christianity <br/>
in Najran in the land of the Arabs. Such is the report of Wahb b. Munab- <br/>
bih on the authority of the people of Najran. </p>
<p>'ABDULLAH IBN AL-THAMIR AND THOSE WHO <br/>
PERISHED IN THE TRENCH </p>
<p>Yazid b. Ziyad told me on the authority of Muhammad b. Ka'b al-Qurazi, <br/>
and a man of Najran also told me, that according to his people they used to <br/>
worship idols. Najran is the largest town in which the people of the neigh¬ <br/>
bouring district congregated, and in a village hard by there was a sorcerer <br/>
who used to instruct the young men of Najran in his art. When Faymiyun <br/>
came there—they did not call him by the name that Wahb b. Munabbih <br/>
gives him but simply said a man came there—he put up a tent between <br/>
Najran and the place where the sorcerer was. Now the people of Najran <br/>
used to send their young men to that sorcerer to be taught sorcery and <br/>
al-Thamir sent his son 'Abdullah along with them. When he passed by the <br/>
man in the tent he was immensely struck by his prayers and devotion and <br/>
began to sit with him and listen to him until he became a Muslim 2 and <br/>
acknowledged the unity of God and worshipped Him. He asked questions <br/>
about the law's of Islam until when he became fully instructed therein he <br/>
asked the man what was the Great Name of God. Although he knew it he <br/>
kept it from him, saying: ‘My dear young man, 3 you will not be able to <br/>
bear it; I fear that you are not strong enough.! Now al-Thamir had no <br/>
idea that his son 'Abdullah was not visiting the sorcerer along with the <br/>
other young men. 'Abdullah seeing that his master had kept the knowledge <br/>
from him and was afraid of his weakness, collected a number of sticks and <br/>
whenever he taught him a name of God he wrote that name on a stick. <br/>
When he had got them all he lit a fire and began to throw them in one by one <br/>
until when he reached the stick w r ith the Great Name inscribed on it he <br/>
threw it in, and it immediately sprang out untouched by the fire. There¬ <br/>
upon he took it and went and told his master that he knew the Great <br/>
Name which he had concealed from him. The latter questioned him <br/>
and when he learned how he had found out the secret he said, O my young </p>
<p>1 Or ‘innovations* (ahddth), so Nold., op. cit., 182, v.s. </p>

<p>The Life of Muhammad 17 </p>
<p>friend, 1 you have got it, but keep it to yourself, though I do not think you <br/>
will.* 24 </p>
<p>Thereafter whenever 'Abdullah b. al-Thamir entered Najran and met <br/>
any sick person he would say to him, ‘O servant of God, will you acknow¬ <br/>
ledge the unity of God and adopt my religion so that I may pray to God <br/>
that he may heal you of your affliction?’ The man would agree, acknowledge <br/>
the unity of God, and become a Muslim, and he would pray for him and he <br/>
would be healed, until in the end there was not a single sick person in <br/>
Najran but had adopted his religion and become whole from his sickness. <br/>
When the news reached the king he sent for him and said: ‘You have <br/>
corrupted the people of my town so that they are against me and have <br/>
opposed my religion and the religion of my fathers. I will make a terrible <br/>
example of you!’ He replied: ‘You have not the power to do that.’ The <br/>
king had him taken to a high mountain and thrown down headlong, but he <br/>
reached the ground unhurt. Then he had him thrown into deep water in <br/>
Najran from which no one had ever emerged alive, but he came out safely. </p>
<p>Having thus got the better of him 'Abdullah told him that he would not <br/>
be able to kill him until he acknowledged the unity of God and believed <br/>
in his religion; but that if he did that he would be given power to kill him. <br/>
The king then acknowledged the unity of God and pronounced the creed <br/>
of 'Abdullah, and hitting him a moderate blow with a stick which he had in <br/>
his hand he killed him and died himself on the spot. The people of Najran <br/>
accepted the religion of 'Abdullah b. al-Thamir according to the Gospel <br/>
and the law which 'Isa b. Maryam brought. Afterwards they were over¬ <br/>
taken by the misfortunes 2 which befell their co-religionists. Such is the <br/>
origin of Christianity in Najran. But God knows best (what the facts are). </p>
<p>Such is the report of Muhammad b. Ka' b. al-Qurazi and one of the <br/>
men of Najran about 'Abdullah b. al-Thamir, but God knows best what <br/>
happened. </p>
<p>Dhu Nuwas came against them with his armies and invited them to <br/>
accept Judaism, giving them the choice between that or death: they chose <br/>
death. So he dug trenches for them; burnt some in fire, slew some with <br/>
the sword, and mutilated them until he had killed nearly twenty thousand <br/>
of them. 3 Concerning Dhu Nuwas and that army of his God revealed to <br/>
his apostle </p>

<p>It is said that among those put to death by Dhu Nuwas was 'Abdullah b. <br/>

<p>I was told by 'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr b. Muhammad b. 'Amr b. Hazm <br/>
that he was told that in the days of 'Umar b. al-Khattab a man of Najran <br/>
dug up one of the ruins of Najran intending to make use of the land, when <br/>
they came upon 'Abdullah b. al-Thamir under a grave; he was in a sitting <br/>
posture with his hand covering a wound in his head and holding firmly to <br/>
it. When his hand was removed the blood began to flow; w r hen they let go <br/>
of his hand it returned to its place and the flow of blood ceased. On his <br/>
finger was a ring inscribed ‘Allah is my Lord’. A report was sent to 'Umar <br/>
and he replied: ‘Leave him alone and cover in the grave’ and his orders were <br/>
duly carried out. </p>
<p>of daus dhu tha'labAn and the beginning of the </p>
<p>ABYSSINIAN DOMINATION AND THE HISTORY OF <br/>
ARYAT WHO BECAME VICEROY OF THE YAMAN </p>
<p>A man of Saba* called Daus Dhu Tha'laban escaped on a horse, and taking <br/>
to the desert eluded them. 2 He pressed on until he reached the Byzantine <br/>
court, when he asked the emperor to aid him against Dhu Nuwas and his <br/>
26 troops, telling him what had happened. The latter replied that his country <br/>
was too distant for him to be able to help by sending troops, but that he <br/>
would write to the Abyssinian king who was a Christian and whose <br/>
territory was near the Yaman. Accordingly he did write ordering him to <br/>
help Daus and seek revenge. </p>
<p>Daus went to the Negus with the emperor’s letter, and he sent w r ith him <br/>
seventy thousand Abyssinians, putting over them a man called Aryat. <br/>
(T. He ordered him to kill a third of the men, lay waste a third of the <br/>
country, and seize a third of the women and children if he conquered.) <br/>
With the army there was a man called Abraha ‘Split-face’. Aryat crossed <br/>
the sea with Daus Dhu Tha'laban and landed in the Yaman. Dhu Nuwas <br/>
with the Himyarites and such of the Yaman! tribes as were under his com¬ <br/>
mand came out against him, and after an engagement Dhu Nuwas and his <br/>
force was put to flight. 3 * Seeing that his cause was lost Dhu Nuwas turned <br/>
his horse seawards beating it until it entered the waves and carried him <br/>
through the shallows out into the deep water. This was the last that was <br/>
seen of him. Ary 5 $ entered the Yaman and took possession of it. (T. He </p>

<p>25 HOW ABRAHA SEIZED POWER IN THE YAMAN AND </p>
<p>killed aryAt 1 </p>
<p>Arvat held sway in the Yaman for some years and then Abraha the <br/>
Abyssinian (T. who was in his army) disputed his authority, and </p>
<p>Abyssinians split into two parties each claiming supporters When war </p>
<p>was about to begin, Abraha sent to Aryat asking him to avert the dang <br/>
internecine war and inviting him to settle the dispute by P<sup>^naUomb</sup> <br/>
the winner to be the sole commander of the army. Arya agreed ^idAbmha <br/>
went forth to meet him. He was a short fat man holding the Christian <br/>
faith; and Aryat advanced against him spear in hand; he was a big, tall, </p>
<p>, a * AK r aha had a young man called Atawda at his back to </p>
<p>defend'hhn against attack from the rear. ArySf raised his spear striking <br/>
at Abraha’s skull and hit him on the forehead splitting h's eyebrow^nos <br/>
eve and mouth. It was for this reason that he was called al-Ashram <br/>
39 (spit-face). Thereupon 'Atawda coming out from behind Abraha attacked <br/>
A?vSt and killed him, and ArySt’s army joined Abraha, and the Abyssinians </p>
<p>£2 Yaman accepted himaltheir chief. (T-Then 'Atawda cried: "Atawda </p>
<p>you see, of an evil company; parentless in nobility', meaning that Abraha <br/>
slave had killed ArySJ. Al-Ashram asked what he wanted, for thoug </p>
<p>had killed him blood-money must be paid. He asked and obtame rom 1m </p>
<p>1 A slightly longer account is given in Azr. i. 86, </p>
<p>21 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>the right of primae noctis in Yaman.) Abraha paid blood-money for killing <br/>
Aryat. (T. All this happened without the knowledge of the Negus.) </p>
<p>When the news of this affair reached the Negus he was filled with rage <br/>
and said: ‘Has he attacked my amir and killed him without any order from <br/>
me ?* Then he swore an oath that he would not leave Abraha alone until <br/>
he had trodden his land and cut off his forelock. So Abraha shaved his <br/>
head and filled a leather bag with the earth of the Yaman and sent it to the <br/>
Negus with the following letter: ‘O King, Aryat was only thy slave and I <br/>
too am thy slave. We disputed about your orders; everyone must obey <br/>
you; but I was stronger, firmer, and more skilful in managing the affairs of <br/>
the Abyssinians. Now when I was told of the king’s oath I shaved the <br/>
whole of my head and I send it to you with a bag of the dust of my land that <br/>
you may put it beneath your feet and thus keep your oath concerning me.’ </p>
<p>When this message reached the Negus he was reconciled to him and wrote <br/>
to him that he was to stay in the Yaman until further orders; so Abraha <br/>
remained in the Yaman. (T. When Abraha perceived that the Negus was T. 933 <br/>
reconciled and had made him viceregent of the Yaman, he sent to Abu <br/>
Murra b. Dhu Yazan and took away from him his wife Rayhana d. <br/>
'Alqama b. Malik b. Zayd b. Kahlan. Abu Murra who is Dhu Jadan had <br/>
a son by her—Ma'dI Karib. Afterwards she bore to Abraha a son Masruq <br/>
and a daughter Basbasa. Abu Murra took to flight. His slave 'Atawda <br/>
went on exercising his right in Yaman until a man of Himyar of Khath'am <br/>
attacked and killed him; and when the news reached Abraha, who was <br/>
a lenient noble character, a Christian of temperate habits, he told the <br/>
people that it was high time that they had an official with due self-control <br/>
and that had he known that 'Atawda would have chosen such a reward for <br/>
his services he would not have allowed him to choose his reward. Further no <br/>
bloodwit would be exacted and he would not take any action against them <br/>
for killing 'Atawda.) </p>
<p>THE HISTORY OF THE ELEPHANT AND THE STORY OF <br/>
THE INTERCALATORS </p>
<p>Then Abraha built the cathedral 1 in San'a’, such a church as could not be <br/>
seen elsewhere in any part of the world at that time. He wrote to the <br/>
Negus saying: ‘I have built a church for you, 0 King, such as has not been <br/>
built for any king before you. I shall not rest until I have diverted the <br/>
Arabs’ pilgrimage to it.’ When the Arabs were talking about this letter of <br/>
his, one of the calendar intercalators was enraged. He was of the B. <br/>
Fuqaym b. 'Adly b. 'Amir b. Tha'laba b. al-Harith b. Malik b. Kinana b. <br/>
Khuzayma b. Mudrika b. Ilyas b. Mudar. The intercalators are those <br/>
who used to adjust the months for the Arabs in the time of ignorance. They </p>
<p>1 al-Qullays. The Arab commentators derive this word from an Arabic root, but it is <br/>
simply the Greek ekklesia. </p>
<p>22 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>would make one of the holy months profane, and make one of the profane </p>
<p>30 months holy to balance the calendar. It was about this that God sent <br/>
down: ‘Postponement (of a sacred month) is but added infidelity by which <br/>
those who disbelieve are misled. They make it (the month) profahe one <br/>
year and make it sacred the next year, that they may make up the number of <br/>
the months which God has made sacred (33).’ 1 </p>
<p>The first to impose this system of intercalation on the Arabs was <br/>
al-Qalkmmas who was Hudhayfa b. 'Abd b. Fuqaym b. 'Adly b. ‘Amir <br/>
b. Tha'laba b. al-Harith b. Malik b. Kinana b. Khuzayma; his son 'Abbad <br/>
followed him; then his descendants Qala', Umayya, 'Auf, and Abu <br/>
ThumSma Junada b. 'Auf who was the last of them, for he was overtaken <br/>
by Islam. When the Arabs had finished pilgrimage, it used to be their <br/>
practice to gather round him and he would declare the four sacred months <br/>
Rajab, Dhu’l-Qa'da, Dhu’l-Hijja, and al-Muharram. If he wanted to free <br/>
a period he would free al-Muharram and they would declare it free and ban <br/>
§afar in its place so as to make up the number of the four sacred months. <br/>
When they wanted to return from Mecca, 2 he got up and said: ‘O God, <br/>
I have made one of the Safars free for them, the first Safar,' and I have <br/>
postponed the other till next year.’ </p>
<p>About this 'Umayr b. Qays Jadhlu’l-Ti'an, one of the B. Firas b. <br/>
Ghanm b. Tha’laba b. Malik b. Kinana, boasting of this determining of <br/>
the months, improvised: </p>
<p>Ma'add knows that my people are the most honourable of men and <br/>
have noble ancestors. </p>
<p>31 Who has escaped us when we seek vengeance and whom have we not </p>
<p>made to champ the bit ? </p>
<p>Are we not Ma'add’s calendar-makers, making profane months sacred ? <br/>
(34)* </p>
<p>The Kinanite went forth until he came to the cathedral and defiled <br/>
it (35). Then he returned to his own country. Hearing of the matter Abraha <br/>
made inquiries and learned that the outrage had been committed by an <br/>
Arab who came from the temple in Mecca where the Arabs went on <br/>
pilgrimage, and that he had done this in anger at his threat to divert the <br/>
Arabs’ pilgrimage to the cathedral, showing thereby that it was unworthy <br/>
of reverence. </p>
<p>Abraha was enraged and swore that he would go to this temple and <br/>
T. 934 destroy it. (T* With Abraha there were some Arabs who had come to seek <br/>
his bounty, among them Muhammad b. Khuz&amp;'i b. KhuzSba al-Dhak- <br/>
winl, al-Sulami, with a number of his tribesmen including a brother of his <br/>
called Qays. While they were with him a feast of Abraha occurred and <br/>
he sent to invite them to the feast. Now he used to eat an animal’s testicles, </p>
<p>1 SOra 9. j*7. </p>
<p>1 If by tKu time a sacred month was due, raiding and blood-revenge would be taboo; <br/>
hence the need to declare the month profane. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 23 </p>
<p>so when the invitation was brought they said, ‘By God, if we eat this the <br/>
Arabs will hold it against us as long as we live.’ Thereupon Muhammad got <br/>
up and went to Abraha and said, ‘O King, this is a festival of ours in which <br/>
we eat only the loins and shoulders.’ Abraha replied that he would send <br/>
them what they liked, because his sole purpose in inviting them was to <br/>
show that he honoured them. Then he crowned Muhammad and made <br/>
him amir of Mudar and ordered him to go among the people to invite <br/>
them to pilgrimage at his cathedral which he had built. When Muhammad <br/>
got as far as the land of Kinana the people of the lowland knowing what <br/>
he had come for sent a man of Hudhayl called 'Urwa b. Hayyad al-MilasT <br/>
who shot him with an arrow, killing him. His brother Qays who was with <br/>
him fled to Abraha and told him the news, which increased his rage and <br/>
fury and he swore to raid the B. Kinana and destroy the temple.) So he <br/>
commanded the Abyssmians to prepare and make ready, and sallied forth <br/>
with the elephant. News of this plunged the Arabs into alarm and anxiety <br/>
and they decided that it was incumbent on them to fight against him when <br/>
they heard that he meant to destroy the Ka'ba, God’s holy house. </p>
<p>A member one of the ruling families in the Yaman, Dhu Nafr by <br/>
name summoned his people and such of the Arabs as would follow him to <br/>
fight Abraha and stop him from attacking and destroying God’s holy <br/>
house A certain number supported him, but after a battle Dhu Nafr and <br/>
his followers were put to flight and he himself was taken prisoner and </p>
<p>br0Ugbt 1 ° Abraha * When he was ab °ut to put him to death Dhu Nafr <br/>
pleaded for his life on the ground that he would be more useful to him <br/>
a ive than dead. Abraha then gave him his life but kept him in fetters He <br/>
was a merciful man. </p>
<p>Abraha continued on his road to Mecca until in the country of Khath'am <br/>
he was opposed by Nufayl b. Habib a!-Khath'ami with their two tribes <br/>
ohahran and Nahis and such of the Arab tribes as followed him. After an <br/>
engagement he was defeated and taken prisoner. When Abraha thought <br/>
of kllhng him, Nufayl said: ‘Don't kill me, O King, for I will be your <br/>
guide '" 'he Arab country. Here are my two hands as surety that the two </p>
<p>tribes of Khath am, Shahrto and Nahis, will obey you.’ So Abraha let <br/>
him go. </p>

<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>When on the march Iraq’s wide plain <br/>
Is theirs—moreover they read and write (36). </p>
<p>He also said: </p>
<p>If you ask me who I am, Lubayna, and of my line <br/>
I will tell you the certain truth. </p>
<p>We belong to al-Nablt the father of Qasly <br/>
To Mansur son of Yaqdum (our) forefathers (37). </p>
<p>They said to him: O King, we are thy servants attentive and obedient <br/>
to you. We have no quarrel with you and our temple—meaning that of <br/>
al-Lat—is not the one you seek. You want only the temple in Mecca, and <br/>
we will send with you a man to guide you there. He therefore passed on <br/>
leaving them unmolested. </p>
<p>As to al-L§t it was a temple of theirs in al-Ta’if which they used to <br/>
venerate as the Ka'ba is venerated (38). So they sent with him Abu <br/>
Righal to guide him on the way to Mecca, and when he had brought <br/>
him as far as al-Mughammis 1 Abu Righal died there and the Arabs <br/>
stoned his grave. This is the grave which people in al-Mughammis. still <br/>
stone. 2 </p>
<p>Arrived here, Abraha sent an Abyssinian called al-Aswad b. Mafsud 3 <br/>
with some cavalry as far as Mecca and the latter sent off to him the plunder <br/>
of the people of Tihama, the Quraysh and others, among it two hundred <br/>
camels belonging to 'Abdu’l-Muftalib b. Hashim, who at that time was <br/>
the leading shaykh of Quraysh. At first Quraysh, Kinana, and Hudhayl <br/>
and others who were in the holy place meditated battle, but seeing that <br/>
they had not the power to offer resistance they gave up the idea. </p>
<p>Abraha sent Huna^a the Himyarite to Mecca instructing him to inquire <br/>
who was the chief notable of the country and to tell him that the king’s <br/>
message was that he had not come to fight them, but only to destroy the <br/>
temple. If they offered no resistance there was no cause for bloodshed, <br/>
and if he wished to avoid war he should return with him. On reaching <br/>
Mecca Hunafca was told that 'Abdu’l-Muttalib b. Hashim b. 'Abd Manaf <br/>
b. Qu§ayy was the leading notable, so he went to him and delivered Abraha’s <br/>
message. 'Abdu’l-Muttalib replied: ‘God knows that we do not wish to <br/>
fight him for we have not the power to do so. This is Allah’s sanctuary <br/>
and the temple of His friend Abraham—or words to that effect—If He <br/>
defends it against him it is His temple and His sanctuary; and if he <br/>
lets him have it by God we cannot defend it!’ Hunata replied that he <br/>
must come with him to Abraha, for he was ordered to bring him back <br/>
with him. </p>
<p>So accompanied by one of his sons' , Abdu’I-Mu$$alib came to the camp </p>
<p>1 Also written al-Mughammas, a place ‘two thirds of a parasang’ (roughly two miles) <br/>
from Mecca. </p>
<ul>

<p>and inquired for Dhu Nafr, for he was a friend of his. He went in to see <br/>
him as he was in confinement and asked him if he could do anything to <br/>
help them in their trouble. Dhu Nafr replied: ‘What use is a man held a <br/>
prisoner in the hands of a king, expecting to be killed at any moment? </p>
<p>I can do nothing to help you except that Unays the keeper of the elephant <br/>
eing a friend of mine, I will send to him and commend your case to him <br/>
as strongly as possible asking him to try to get you permission to see the <br/>
lung, bo speak as you think fit, and he will intercede for you with the king <br/>
if he is able to do so.’ So Dhu Nafr sent to Unays saying, ‘The king has <br/>
taken two hundred camels belonging to 'Abdu’l-Muttalib, lord of Quravsh <br/>
and master of the Meccan 1 well who feeds men in the plain and wild </p>
<p>creatures on the top of the mountains, and is now here. So ask permission 3* </p>
<p>or him to see the king and help him as far as you can.’ He said he would <br/>
do so and repeated these words to the king, adding that 'Abdu’l-Muttalib <br/>
wished to see him and talk to him about a pressing matter. Abraha agreed <br/>
to see him. Now Abdu’l-Muftalib was a most impressive, handsome, and <br/>
dignified man, and when Abraha saw him he treated him with the greatest <br/>
respect so that he would not let him sit beneath him. He could not let the <br/>
Abyssmians see him sitting beside him on his royal throne, so he got off <br/>
his throne and sat upon his carpet and made 'Abdu’l-Muftalib sit beside <br/>
him there. Then he told his interpreter to inquire what he wanted, and the <br/>
reply was that he wanted the king to return two hundred camels of his <br/>
which he had taken. Abraha replied through the interpreter, ‘You pleased <br/>
me much when I saw you; then I was much displeased with you when I <br/>
heard what you said. Do you wish to talk to me about two hundred camels <br/>
oi yours which I have taken, and say nothing about your religion and the <br/>
religion of your forefathers which I have come to destroy?’ 'Abdu’I-Mut- <br/>
taJib replied, ‘ I am the owner of the camels and the temple has an owner who <br/>
will defend it- When the king replied that he could not defend it against <br/>
him he said, That remains to be seen,’ ('Give me back my camels.') T oto <br/>
Some learned people allege that when ’Abdu’l-Mut t alib went to Abraha <br/>
when he sent Hunafa to him, there accompanied him Ya'mur b. Nufatha <br/>
b Adty b. al-Du il b. Bakr b. ’Abd Manat b. Kinana, at that time chief <br/>
ot B. Bakr, and Khuwaylid b. Wathila, then chief of Hudhayl They <br/>
offered to give Abraha a third of the cattle of the lowland on condition <br/>
that he would withdraw from them and not destroy the temple, but he <br/>
refused their request; but God knows whether this was so or not At </p>
<p>any rate Abraha restored to 'Abdu’l-Mut t alib the camels which he’had <br/>
taken, </p>
<p>. Whe J the y left Wm, 'Abdu’l-Muttalib went back to Quraysh and having <br/>
given them the news ordered them to withdraw from Mecca and take up <br/>
defensive positions on the peaks and in the passes of the mountains for <br/>
fear of the excesses of the soldiers. 'AbduTMutfalib took hold of the <br/>
metal knocker of the Ka'ba, and a number of Quraysh stood with him praying </p>
<p>1 C. has 'tr, ‘caravan’. </p>
<p>26 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>27 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>to God and imploring his help against Abraha and his army. As he was <br/>
holding the knocker of the temple door, 'Abdu’l-Muttalib said: </p>
<p>35 O God, a man protects his dwelling so protect Thy dwellings. 1 </p>
<p>Let not their cross and their craft tomorrow overcome Thy craft (39). 2 </p>
<p>‘Ikrima b. 'Amir b. Hashim b. 'Abdu Manaf b. 'Abd al-Dar b. Qusayy <br/>
said: </p>
<p>O God, humiliate al-Aswad b. Mafsud </p>
<p>Who took a hundred camels wearing their collars; </p>
<p>Between Hira’ and Thabir and the deserts, </p>
<p>He shut them in when they should be pasturing freely, </p>
<p>And delivered them to the black barbarians, </p>
<p>Withdraw from him thine aid, O Lord, for Thou art worthy to be <br/>
praised (40). </p>
<p>*AbduTMut$alib then let go the knocker of the door of the Ka'ba and <br/>
went off with his Quraysh companions to the mountain tops where they <br/>
took up defensive positions waiting to see what Abraha would do when he <br/>
occupied Mecca. In the morning Abraha prepared to enter the town and <br/>
made his elephant ready for battle and drew up his troops. His intention <br/>
was to destroy the temple and then return to the Yaman. When they made <br/>
the elephant (its name was Mahmud) face Mecca, Nufayl b. Habib came <br/>
up to its flank and taking hold of its ear said: ‘Kneel, Mahmud, or go <br/>
straight back whence you came, for you are in God’s holy land!’ He let go <br/>
of its ear and the elephant knelt, and Nufayl made off at tog speed for the <br/>
top of the mountain. The troops beat the elephant to make it get up but it <br/>
would not; they beat its head with iron bars; they stuck hooks into its <br/>
underbelly and scarified it; but it would not get up. Then they made it <br/>
face the Yaman and immediately it got up and started off. When they set <br/>
it towards the north and the east it did likewise, but as soon as they directed <br/>
it towards Mecca it knelt dow r n. </p>
<p>Then God sent upon them birds from the sea like swallows and </p>
<p>36 starlings; each bird carried three stones, like peas and lentils, one in its <br/>
beak and two between its claws. Everyone who was hit died but not all <br/>
were hit. They withdrew in flight by the way they came, crying out for <br/>
Nufayl b. Habib to guide them on the way to the Yaman. When he saw <br/>
the punishment which God had brought down on them Nufayl said: </p>
<p>Where can one flee when God pursueth ? </p>
<p>Al-Ashram is the conquered not the conqueror (41). </p>
<p>1 Ifilal, the plural of billa, means a collection of houses and also the people who live <br/>
therein. For. rafilahu al-Shahrastani, Milal, has hillahu ‘his neighbour’, and for ghadtvart <br/>
‘tomorrow’ * adman , which could be rendered ‘hostile’ here. For qiblatand he has Kabatand. </p>
<p>1 rmhdl here is said by C. and Abu Dharr to mean strength and power; but it really means <br/>
‘guile’, ‘strategy accompanied by force’. ‘Craft’, cf. Kraft, appears to be the best rendering. <br/>
The passage is a reminiscence of Sura 13. 14, and the idea may be found in the Quranic <br/>
saying of God: Khayru l-makirm, 3. 47. T- has preserved four lines of no poetic merit which <br/>
I.H. preferred to excise. </p>
<p>Nufayl also said: </p>
<p>Our greetings, Rudayna! </p>
<p>You rejoice our eyes this morning! </p>
<p>[Your fuel-seeker came to us last night, r p. 94a </p>
<p>But we had naught to give him.] </p>
<p>If you had seen, but you will not see, Rudayna, </p>
<p>What we saw on al-Muhassab’s side 1 <br/>
You would have forgiven me and praised my action <br/>
And not have been vexed at what has passed and gone. 2 <br/>
I praised God when I saw the birds, </p>
<p>And I feared the stones that might fall upon us. </p>
<p>Everyone was asking for Nufayl <br/>
As though I owed the Abyssinians a debt. </p>
<p>As they withdrew they were continually falling by the wayside dying <br/>
miserably by every waterhole. Abraha was smitten in his body, and as they <br/>
took him away his fingers fell off one by one. Where the finger had been, <br/>
there arose an evil sore exuding pus and blood, so that when they brought <br/>
him to Sana* he was like a young fledgeling. They allege that as he died <br/>
his heart burst from his body. (A. Deserters from the army, labourers, <br/>
and campfollowers remained in Mecca and became workers and shepherds ‘ 9 * <br/>
for the population.) </p>
<p>Ya'qub b. r Utba told me that he was informed that that year was the <br/>
first time that measles and smallpox had been seen in Arabia; and, too, <br/>
that it was the first time that bitter herbs like rue, colocynth, and Ascleptas <br/>
gigantea were seen. </p>
<p>When God sent Muhammad he specially recounted to the Quraysh <br/>
his goodness and favour in turning back the Abyssinians in order to <br/>
preserve their state and permanence. ‘Did you not see how your Lord <br/>
dealt with the owners of the elephant ? Did He not reduce their guile to <br/>
sheer terror? And sent upon them flocks of birds, throwing hard clay <br/>
stones upon them, making them as blades of corn that have been devoured. </p>
<p>And again: ‘For the uniting of Quraysh, their uniting the caravans to 37 <br/>
ply summer and winter. Then let them worship the Lord of this temple, <br/>
who has fed them so that they hunger not, and made them safe from fear’/ </p>

authorities aay that the first reading means ‘for the preparing and fitting out’. Others say <br/>
ffiat accordmg to the third reading the meaning is ‘the protecting’. According to Ibn al- <br/>

<p>REFERENCES IN POETRY TO THE STORY OF THE <br/>
ELEPHANT </p>
<p>When God turned back the Abyssinians from Mecca and executed His <br/>
vengeance upon them, the Arabs held the Quraysh in great honour, saying, <br/>
‘They are the people of God: God fought for them and thwarted the <br/>
attack of their enemies.’ On this theme they composed many poems. <br/>
Thus 'Abdullah b. al-Zibra'ra b. 'Adly b. Qays b. 'Adiy b. Sa'd b. Sahm b. <br/>
*Amr b. Husays b. Ka'b b. Lu’ayy b. Ghalib b. Fihr said: </p>
<p>Withdraw from the vale of Mecca for </p>
<p>From of old its sanctuary has not been violated. </p>
<p>When it was sanctified, Sirius had not been created. </p>
<p>No mighty man has ever attacked it. </p>
<p>39 Ask the commander of the Abyssinians 2 what he saw. </p>
<p>He who knows what happened will tell the ignorant. </p>
<p>Sixty thousand men returned not home, </p>
<p>Nor did their sick recover after their return. </p>
<p>'Ad and Jurhum were (in Mecca) before them. </p>
<p>God has set it above all creatures. </p>
<p>The words ‘nor did their sick recover after their return’ refer to Abraha <br/>
whom they carried with them when he was smitten, until he died in San'a’. <br/>
Abu Qays b. al-Aslat al-Ansar! aUKhafmi, Sayfl by name (43) said: </p>
<p>His work it was on the day of the Abyssinian elephant. <br/>
Whenever they urged it forward it held its ground, </p>
<p>(They drove) their hooks beneath its flanks, </p>
<p>They split its nose and it was torn. </p>
<p>They used a knife as a whip. </p>
<p>When they applied it to its back it made a wound. </p>
<p>It turned and faced the way it had come. </p>
<p>Those there bore the burden of their injustice. </p>
<p>this tradition. The four brothers gave this protection (tlaf) to those journeying to the <br/>
several countries. Thus for lldf the meanings of covenant, protection, and responsibility for <br/>
safety are illustrated. </p>

T« 945 (T. Himyar and the tribes of Yaman were humiliated under the heel of the <br/>
Abyssinians. They took their women and killed their men and seized their <br/>

Masruq b. Abraha reigned over the Abyssinians in the ^ aman. </p>
<p>THE JOURNEY OF SAYF B. DHU YAZAN AND THE RULE OF <br/>
WAHRIZ IN THE YAMAN </p>
<p>When the people of the Yaman had long endured oppression, Sayf b. <br/>
Dhu Yazan the Himyarite, who was known as Abu Murra, went to the <br/>
Byzantine emperor and complained to him of his troubles, asking him to <br/>
drive out the Abyssinians and take over the country. He asked him <br/>
to send what forces he pleased and promised him the kingdom of the </p>
<p>Yaman. . t . XT &lt; - </p>
<p>42 The emperor paid no attention to his request, so he went to al-Mu man </p>
<p>b. al-Mundhir, who was Chosroes 1 governor at al-Hira and the surrounding <br/>
country of Iraq. When he complained of the Abyssinians, al-Nu man b. <br/>
al-Mundhir told him that he paid a formal visit every year to Chosroes <br/>
and he asked him to stay with him until then. Accordingly he took him <br/>
with him and introduced him to Chosroes. Now he used to sit in his <br/>
audience chamber which contained his crown. According to reports, his <br/>
crown was like a huge grain-measure with rubies, pearls, and topazes set <br/>
in gold and silver, suspended by a golden chain from the top of the dome <br/>
in his hall of audience. Such was the weight of the crown that his neck <br/>
could not bear it. He was hidden behind a robe until he sat on his throne; <br/>
then his head was inserted into the crown, and when he was settled com¬ <br/>
fortably on his throne the-robes were taken from him. Everyone who saw <br/>
him for the first time fell to his knees in awe. When Sayf b. Dhu Yazan </p>
<p>entered his presence he fell to his knees ( 49 )* , </p>
<p>He said: ‘O King, ravens 1 have taken possession of our country. <br/>
Chosroes asked, ‘What ravens, Abyssinians or Sindians?’ ‘Abyssinians,’ he <br/>
replied, ‘and I have come to you for help and that you may assume the </p>
<p>1 i.e. ‘blacks’. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 31 </p>
<p>kingship of my country.’ He answered, ‘Your country is far distant and <br/>
has little to attract me; I cannot endanger a Persian army in Arabia and <br/>
there is no reason why I should do so.’ Then he made him a present of <br/>
10,000 drachmae sterling and invested him in a fine robe. Sayf went out <br/>
with the silver and began to scatter it among the people; (T. Boys and T- 947 <br/>
slaves of both sexes scrambled for the coins). When the king was told of <br/>
this he thought it very extraordinary and sent for him and said, ‘You mean <br/>
to throw away a royal gift!’ He answered: ‘What use is silver to me? The <br/>
mountains of my country from which I come are nothing but gold and <br/>
silver.’ This he said to excite his cupidity. Chosroes thereupon gathered <br/>
his advisers together and asked their opinion about the man and his project. </p>
<p>One of them reminded the king that in his prisons there were men who <br/>
were condemned to death. If he were to send them with him and they <br/>
were killed, that would merely be the fate that he had determined for them; 43 <br/>
on the other hand, if they conquered the country he would have added to <br/>
his empire. Thereupon Chosroes sent those who were confined in his <br/>
prisons to the number of eight hundred men. </p>
<p>He put in command of them a man called Wahriz who was of mature <br/>
age and of excellent family and lineage. They set out in eight ships, two <br/>
of which foundered, so that only six reached the shores of Aden. Sayf <br/>
brought all the people that he could tQ Wahriz saying, ‘My foot is with <br/>
your foot, we die or conquer together.’ ‘Right,’ said Wahriz. Masruq b. </p>
<p>Abraha the king of Yaman came out against him with his army, and <br/>
Wahriz sent one of his sons to fight them so as to get experience in their <br/>
way of fighting. His son was killed and he was filled with rage against <br/>
them. When the men were drawn up in their ranks Wahriz said, ‘Show me <br/>
their king.’ They said, ‘Do you see a man on an elephant with a crown on <br/>
his head and a red ruby on his forehead ? That is their king.’ ‘Let him be,’ <br/>
he said, and they waited a long time and then he said, ‘What is he riding <br/>
now?’ They said: ‘He is now bestride a horse’; again they waited. He <br/>
asked the same question and they said he was bestride a mule. Said <br/>
Wahriz: ‘An ass’s filly 1 A weak creature, and so is his kingdom. I will <br/>
shoot him. If you see that his followers have not moved, then stand fast <br/>
until I give you permission to advance, for I shall have missed the fellow. </p>
<p>But if you see the people flocking round him I shall have hit him, so fall <br/>
upon them.’ He then bent his bow (the story goes that it was so tough <br/>
that no one but he could bend it) and ordered that his eyebrows be fastened <br/>
back, 1 then he shot Masruq and split the ruby in his forehead and the <br/>
arrow pierced his head and came out at the back of his neck. He fell off his <br/>
mount and the Abyssinians gathered round him. When the Persians fell <br/>
upon them, they fled and were killed as they bolted in all directions. </p>
<p>Wahriz advanced to enter into San'a’, and when he reached its gate he said <br/>
that his standard should never be lowered and he ordered them to destroy <br/>
the gate and went in with his flag flying. </p>
<p>1 His eyes were half closed from age. </p>
<p>32 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Sayf b. Dhu Yazan al-Himyari said: </p>
<p>44 Men thought the two kings had made peace </p>
<p>And those who heard of their reconciliation found the matter was <br/>
very grave. </p>
<p>We slew t^e prince Masruq and reddened the sands with blood. </p>
<p>The new prince, the people’s prince, </p>
<p>Wahriz swore an oath that </p>
<p>He would drink no wine until he had captured prisoners and spoil (5°)- </p>
<p>Abu al-Salt b. Abu Rabi'a al-Thaqafi (51) said: </p>
<p>Let those seek vengeance who are like Ibn Dhu Yazan <br/>
Who spent long years at sea because of his enemies, </p>
<p>When the time for his journey came he went to Caesar <br/>
But did not attain what he sought. </p>
<p>Then he turned to Chosroes after ten years, </p>
<p>Counting his life and money cheap, </p>
<p>Until he came bringing the Persians with him. </p>
<p>By my life you were swift in action, </p>
<p>What a noble band came out: </p>
<p>Never were their like seen among men! </p>
<p>Nobles, princes, mighty men, archers, </p>
<p>Lions who train their cubs in the jungle! </p>
<p>From curved bows they shot arrows <br/>
Stout as the poles of the howdah <br/>
Bringing the victim a speedy death. </p>
<p>You sent lions against black dogs, </p>
<p>Their fugitives are scattered all over the earth. </p>
<p>So drink your fill, wearing your crown, </p>
<p>On Ghumdan’s top reclining in a house you have chosen. </p>
<p>Drink your fill, for they are dead, </p>
<p>And walk proudly today in your flowing robes. </p>
<p>Such are noble deeds! not two pails of milk mingled with water <br/>
Which afterwards become urine (53). </p>
<p>45 'Adly b. Zayd al-HIri, one of B. Tamim, said: </p>
<p>What is there after San'a’ in which once lived <br/>
Rulers of a kingdom whose gifts were lavish? </p>
<p>Its builder raised it to the flying clouds, </p>
<p>Its lofty chambers gave forth musk. </p>
<p>Protected by mountains against the attacks of enemies, 1 <br/>
Its lofty heights unscalable. </p>

to God. </p>
<p>33 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Pleasant was the voice of the night owl there, </p>
<p>Answered at even by a flute player. </p>
<p>Fate brought to it the Persian army <br/>
With their knights in their train; </p>
<p>They travelled on mules laden with death, </p>
<p>While the asses’ foals ran beside them <br/>
Until the princes saw from the top of the fortress <br/>
Their squadrons shining with steel, </p>
<p>The day that they called to the barbarians and al-Yaksum <br/>
‘Cursed be he who runs away!’ </p>
<p>’Twas a day of which the story remains, </p>
<p>But a people of long established 1 dignity came to an end. </p>
<p>Persians 2 replaced the native born, </p>
<p>The days were dark 3 and mysterious. </p>
<p>After noble sons of Tubba', </p>
<p>Persian generals were firmly settled there (54). </p>
<p>(T. When Wahriz had conquered the Yaman and driven out the Abyssi- T- 949 <br/>
nians he wrote to Chosroes telling him of what had been done and sending <br/>
him captured treasure. In his reply the king told him to appoint Sayf king <br/>
of the Yaman. He also gave Sayf instructions to collect taxes every year <br/>
and to remit them to him. He summoned Wahriz to his presence and Sayf <br/>
became king, he being the son of Dhu Yazan of the Kings of the Yaman. </p>
<p>This is what Ibn Humayd told me from Salama on the authority of Ibn <br/>
Ishaq.) 4 </p>
<p>(When Wahriz had gone to Chosroes and made Sayf king of the Yaman, T- 957 <br/>
the latter began to attack the Abyssinians, killing them and slaying the <br/>
women with child until he exterminated all but an insignificant number of <br/>
miserable creatures whom he employed as slaves and runners to go before <br/>
him with their lances. Before very long he was out with these armed slaves <br/>
when suddenly they surrounded him and stabbed him to death. One of <br/>
them established himself as leader.and they went through the Yaman slay¬ <br/>
ing and laying waste the country. When the Persian king heard of this he <br/>
sent Wahriz with 4,000 Persians and ordered him to kill every Abyssinian <br/>
or child of an Abyssinian and an Arab woman, great or small, and not leave <br/>
alive a single man with crisp curly hair. Wahriz arrived and in due course <br/>
carried out these instructions and wrote to tell the king that he had done <br/>
so. The king then gave him viceregal authority and he ruled under Chos¬ <br/>
roes until his death.) </p>

<p>46 THE END OF THE PERSIAN AUTHORITY IN THE </p>
<p>YAMAN </p>
<p>Wahriz and the Persians dwelt in the Yaman, and the Abna’ who are in the <br/>
Yaman today are descended from the survivors of that Persian army. The <br/>
period of Abyssinian domination from the entry of Aryat to the death of <br/>
Masruq ibn Abraha at the hands of the Persians and the expulsion of the <br/>
Abyssinians was seventy-two years. The successive princes were four, <br/>
Aryat, Abraha, Yaksum, and Masruq (55). </p>
<p>47 It is said that on a rock in the Yaman there was an inscription dating <br/>
from olden times: </p>
<p>To whom belongs the kingdom of Dhimar? </p>
<p>To Himyar the righteous. </p>
<p>To whom belongs the kingdom of Dhimar? </p>
<p>To the evil Abyssinians. </p>
<p>To whom belongs the kingdom of Dhimar? </p>
<p>To the free Persians. </p>
<p>To whom belongs the kingdom of Dhimar? </p>
<p>To Quraysh the merchants (56). </p>
<p>Dhimar means the Yaman or San'a’. </p>
<p>Al- A'sha of B. Qays b. Tha'laba said when the words of Satlh and his <br/>
companion were fulfilled: </p>
<p>‘No woman has ever seen, as she saw, the truth like the truth of al-Dhi’bi <br/>
when he prophesied.’ 1 The Arabs called him al-Dhi’bi because he was the <br/>
son of Rabfa b. Mas'ud b. Mazin b. Dhi’b (57). </p>
<p>49 THE DESCENDANTS OF NIZAR B. MA'ADD </p>
<p>Nizar b. Ma'add begat three sons: Mudar, Rabfa, and Anmar (58). </p>
<p>Anmar was the father of Khath'am and Bajila. Jarir b. ‘Abdullah al- <br/>
Bajali who was chief of the Bajila (of whom someone said: ‘But for Jarir, <br/>
Bajila would have perished. A fine man and a poor tribe’) said when he <br/>
was appealing against al-Furafisa al-Kalbl to al-Aqra‘ b. Habis al-Tamlml <br/>
b. 'Iqai b. Mujashi' b. Darim b. Malik b. Hanzala b. Malik b. Zayd Manat: </p>
<p>5° O Aqra‘ b. Habis, O Aqra‘, </p>
<p>If thy brother is overthrown thou wilt be overthrown. </p>
<p>and said: </p>
<p>Ye two sons of Nizar help your brother. </p>
<p>My father I wot is your father. </p>
<p>A brother who is your ally will not be worsted this day. </p>
<p>1 Legend says that the woman in question was able to see people a three days’ journey <br/>
distant. </p>
<p>35 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>They went to the Yaman and remained there (59). </p>
<p>Mudar b. Nizar begat two sons: Ilyas and 'Aylan (60). Ilyas begat three <br/>
sons: Mudrika, Tabikha, and Qam'a. Their mother was Khindif, a Yama- <br/>
nite woman (61). 1 The name of Mudrika was 'Amir and the name of <br/>
Tabikha was 'Amr. There is a story that when they were pasturing their <br/>
camels they hunted some game and sat down to cook it, when some raiders <br/>
swooped upon their camels. ‘Amir said to 'Amr: ‘Will you go after the <br/>
camels or will you cook this game ?’ 'Amr replied that he would go on <br/>
cooking, so 'Amir went after the camels and brought them back. When <br/>
they returned and told their father he said to ‘Amir: ‘You are Mudrika’ <br/>
(the one who overtakes), and to 'Amr he said ‘You are Tabikha’ (the cook). <br/>
When their mother heard the news she came hurriedly from her tent and <br/>
he said: ‘You are trotting!’ ( khandafa) 2 and so she was called Khindif. </p>
<p>As to Qam'a the genealogists of Mudar assert that Khuza'a was one of <br/>
the sons of ‘Amr b. Luhayy b. Qam'a b. Ilyas. </p>
<p>THE STORY OF ‘AMR B. LUHAYY AND AN ACCOUNT OF <br/>
THE IDOLS OF THE ARABS </p>
<p>‘Abdullah b. Abu Bakr b. Muhammad b. 'Amr b. Hazm on the authority <br/>
of his father told me as follows: I was told that the apostle of God said: </p>
<p>‘I saw 'Amr b. Luhayy dragging his intestines in hell, and when I asked <br/>
him about those who had lived between his time and mine he said that they <br/>
had perished.’ </p>
<p>Muhammad b. Ibrahim b. al-Harith al-Tamlmi told me that Abu Salih 51 <br/>
al-Samman told him that he heard Abu Hurayra (62) say: I heard the <br/>
apostle of God saying to Aktham b. al-Jaun al-Khuza'i, ‘O Aktham I saw <br/>
'Amr b. Luhayy b. Qam'a b. Khindif dragging his intestines in hell, and <br/>
never did I see two men so much alike as you and he!’ ‘Will this resem¬ <br/>
blance injure me?’ asked Aktham. ‘No,’ said the apostle, ‘for you are a <br/>
believer and he is an infidel. He was-the first to change the religion of <br/>
Ishmael, to set up idols, and institute the custom of the bahlra, sa’iba, <br/>
wasila, and harm (63 ).^ </p>
<p>They say that the beginning of stone worship among the sons of Ishmael <br/>
was when Mecca became too small for them and they wanted more room in <br/>
the country. Everyone who left the town took with him a stone from the <br/>
sacred area to do honour to it. Wherever they settled they set it up and <br/>
walked round it as they went round the Ka'ba. This led them to worship <br/>
what stones they pleased and those which made an impression on them. <br/>
Thus as generations passed they forgot their primitive faith and adopted </p>

<p>36 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>another religion for that of Abraham and Ishmael. They worshipped idols <br/>
and adopted the same errors as the peoples before them. Yet they retained <br/>
and held fast practices going back to the time of Abraham, such as honour- <br/>
53 ing the temple and going round it, the great and little pilgrimage,, and the <br/>
standing on 'Arafa and Muzdalifa, sacrificing the victims, and the pilgrim <br/>
cry at the great and little pilgrimage, while introducing elements which <br/>
had no place in the religion of Abraham. Thus, Kinana and Quraysh used <br/>
the pilgrim cry: ‘At Thy service, O God, at Thy service! At Thy service, <br/>
Thou without an associate but the associate Thou hast. Thou ownest him <br/>
and what he owns.* They used to acknowledge his unity in their cry and <br/>
then include their idols with God, putting the ownership of them in His <br/>
hand. God said to Muhammad: 1 ‘Most of them do not believe in God <br/>
without associating others with Him,’ i.e. they do not acknowledge My <br/>
oneness with knowledge of My reality, but they associate with Me one of <br/>
My creatures. 2 </p>
<p>The people of Noah had images to which they were devoted. God told <br/>
His apostle about them when He said: ‘And they said, “Forsake not your <br/>
gods; forsake not Wudd and Suwa' and Yaghuth and Ya'uq and Nasr.” <br/>
And they had led many astray.’ 3 </p>
<p>Among those who had chosen those idols and used their names as com¬ <br/>
pounds 4 when they forsook the religion of Ishmael—both Ishmaelites and <br/>
others—was Hudhayl b. Mudrika b. Ilyas b. Mudar. They adopted Suwa' <br/>
and they had him in Ruhat; 5 and Kalb b. Wabra of Quda'a who adopted <br/>
Wudd in Dumatu’l-Jandal. </p>
<p>Ka'b b. Malik al-Ansari said: </p>
<p>We forsook al-Lat and al-'Uzza and Wudd. </p>
<p>We stripped off their necklaces and earrings (64). </p>
<p>Anum of Tayyi* and the people of Jurash of Madhhij adopted Yaghuth <br/>
in Jurash. 6 (65). </p>
<p>Khaywan, 7 a clan of Hamdan, adopted Ya'uq in the land of Hamdan in <br/>
the Yaman (66). </p>
<p>Dhu’l-Kala' of Himyar adopted Nasr in the Himyar country. </p>
<p>53 Khaulan had an idol called 'Ammanas 8 in the Khaulan country. Accord- </p>
<p>1 Sura 12. 106. </p>
<p>2 While the whole of this section is worth comparing with I. al-Kalbi’s K. al~A}ndm, this <br/>
passage is important for the light it throws on I.I.’s sources. Where he writes yaz'umun <br/>
I.K. says ‘I was told by my father and others’. It seems clear that 1 . 1 , has borrowed from <br/>
I.K.’s statements. Where I.K. tvrites ‘their gods’ 1 . 1 . says ‘their idols’, and his language <br/>
tends to follow that of the Quran. </p>

<p>7 Khaywan was a town two nights’ journey from San'a’ on the way to Mecca. I.K. goes </p>
<p>out of his way to say that he has never heard of any Arab using the name of Ya'uq or any </p>
<p>poetry about him. He thinks the reason is the influence of Judaism on Hamdan. I.H.’s <br/>

<p>ing to their own account they used to divide their crops and cattle between <br/>
it and Allah. If any of Allah’s portion which they had earmarked for him <br/>
came into 'Ammanas’s portion they left it to him; but if any of 'Ammanas’s <br/>
portion was in Allah’s portion they returned it to him. They are a clan of <br/>
Khaulan called al-Adim. Some say that it was concerning them that God <br/>
revealed: ‘They assign to Allah of the crotm and cattle he has created a <br/>
portion, and they say this is Allah’s—in their assertion—and this is for <br/>
our partners. Thus what is for their partners does not reach Allah and <br/>
what is for Allah goes to their partners—Evil is their judgment! (67) 1 <br/>
The B. Milkan b. Kinana b. Khuzayma b. Mudrika b. Ilyas b. Mudar had <br/>
an image called Sa‘d, a lofty rock in a desert plain in their country. 2 They <br/>
have a story that one of their tribesmen took some of his stock camels to <br/>
the rock to stand by it so as to acquire its virtue. 3 When the camels, which <br/>
were grazing-camels that were not ridden, saw the rock and smelt the blood <br/>
which had been shed on it they shied from it and fled in all directions. This <br/>
so angered the Milkanite that he seized a stone and threw' it at the idol <br/>
saying, God curse you. You have scared away my camels!’ He went in <br/>
search of them, and when he had collected them together once more he </p>

<p>Quraysh had an idol by a well in the middle of the Ka'ba called Hubal <br/>

sacrificing beside them. They were a man and a woman of Jurhum—Isaf <br/>
K Baghy and Nahla d. Dlk—who were guilty of sexual relations in the <br/>
Ka ba and so God transformed them into two stones. </p>

<p>Abu Talib said: </p>
<p>Where the pilgrims make their camels kneel <br/>
Where the waters flow from Isa’f and Na’ila. 1 </p>
<p>Every household had an idol in their house which they used to worship. <br/>
When a man was about to set out on a journey he would rub himself <br/>
against it as he was about to ride off: indeed that was the last thing he used <br/>
to do before his journey; and when he returned from his journey the first <br/>
thing he did was to rub himself against it before he went in to his family. <br/>
When God sent Muhammad with the message of monotheism Quraysh <br/>
said: ‘Would he make the gods into one God? That is indeed a strange <br/>
proceeding!’ </p>
<p>Now along wdth the Ka'ba the Arabs had adopted Tawaghlt, which were <br/>
temples which they venerated as they venerated the Ka'ba. They had their <br/>
guardians and overseers and they used to make offerings to-them as they <br/>
55 did to the Ka'ba and to circumambulate them and sacrifice at them. Yet <br/>
they recognized the superiority of the Ka'ba because it was the temple and <br/>
mosque of Abraham the friend (of God). </p>
<p>Quraysh and the B. Kinana had al-'Uzza in Nakhla, its guardians and <br/>
overseers were the B. Shayban of Sulaym, allies of the B. Hashim (7°). </p>
<p>An Arab poet said: </p>
<p>Asma’ was given as a dowry the head of a little red cow <br/>
Which a man of the Banu Ghanm had sacrificed. </p>
<p>He saw a blemish in her eye when he led her away </p>
<p>To al-'Uzza’s slaughter-place 2 and divided her into goodly portions. </p>
<p>Their practice when they sacrificed was to divide the victim among the <br/>
worshippers present. Ghabghab was the slaughter-place where the blood <br/>
was poured out (71). </p>
<p>[Azr. i. 74: 'Amr b. Lu’ayy put al-'Uzza in Nakhla, and when they had <br/>
finished their hajj and the circumambulation of the Ka'ba they continued <br/>
to be under taboo until they came to al-'Uzza and had gone round it; there <br/>
they abandoned the pilgrim taboo and stayed a day beside it. It belonged <br/>
to Khuza'a. All Quraysh and B. Kinana used to venerate al-'Uzza along <br/>
with Khuza'a, and all Mudar. Her sadins who used to guard ( hajab ) her <br/>
were B. Shayban of B. Sulaym, allies of B. Hashim. Cf. I.H. 839.] </p>
<p>Al-Lat belonged to Thaqif in Ta’if, her overseers and guardians being <br/>
B. Mu'attib 3 of Thaqif. </p>
<p>Manat was worshipped by al-Aus and al-Khazraj and such of the people </p>

al-Mushallal in Qudayd (72). 1 </p>
<p>[Azr.1 73. Amr b. Lu’ayy set up Manat on the sea-shore near Qudayd <br/>
Azd and Ghassan went on pilgrimage to it and revered it. When they had <br/>
made the compass of the Ka'ba and hastened from 'Arafat and completed <br/>
the rites at Mina they did not shave their hair until they got to Manat to <br/>
whom they would cry Labbayki. Those who did so did not go roiind <br/>
between al-Safa and al-Marwa to the place of the two idols Nahlk Mujawid <br/>
al-Rih and Mut im al-Jayr. This clan of the Ansar used to begin the <br/>
ceremony by hailing Manat, and when they went on the great or little <br/>
pilgrimage they would not go under the shelter of a roof until they had <br/>
completed it. When a man was under taboo as a pilgrim (ahrama) he would <br/>
not enter his house; if he needed something in it he would climb the wall <br/>
behind his house so that the door should not cover his head. When God <br/>

<p>THE BAHlRA, SA’lBA, WASlLA, AND HAMl </p>
<p>The Bahlra is the filly of the Sa’iba: the Sa’iba is the she camel which gives <br/>
birth to ten fillies without an intervening colt. She is set free, is never <br/>
ridden, her hair is not shorn, and only a guest is allowed to drink her milk. <br/>
If she gives birth to a filly after that its ear is split and it is allowed to go its <br/>
way with its mother, not ridden, hair unshorn, and only a guest may drink <br/>
her milk as in the case of her mother. Such is the Bahira, the filly of the <br/>
Sa’iba. The Waslla is an ewe which has ten twin ewes in successive births <br/>
without a male lamb intervening. She is made a Waslla. They use the <br/>
expression zvasalat. Any ewes which she gives birth to after that belong to <br/>
the males, except that if one of them dies all share in eating it, both males <br/>
and females (78). </p>
<p>The Harm is a stallion who is the sire of ten successive fillies without an <br/>
intervening colt. His back is taboo and he is not ridden; his hair is not <br/>
shorn and he is left to run among the camels to mount them. Beyond that <br/>
no use is made of him (79). </p>
<p>58 When God sent his apostle Muhammad he revealed to him: ‘God has <br/>
not made Bahira, or Sa’iba or Waslla or Hami, but those who disbelieve <br/>
invent a lie against God, though most of them do not know it.’ 1 And again: <br/>
‘They say, What is in the wombs of these sheep is reserved for our males <br/>
and prohibited to our wives; but if it is (born) dead they share in it. He <br/>
will repay them for such division, verily He is knowing and wise.’ 2 Again: <br/>
‘Say, have you considered what provision God has sent down to you and <br/>
you have made some of it taboo and some of it permitted ? Say, has God <br/>
given you permission or do you invent lies against God?’ 3 And again: ‘Of <br/>
the sheep two and of the goats two. Say, has He prohibited the tvyo males <br/>
or the two females, or what the wombs of the two females contain ? Inform <br/>
me with knowledge if you speak the truth. And of the camels two and of <br/>
the cattle two. Say, has He prohibited to you the two males or the two <br/>
females, or that which the wombs of the two females contain, or were you <br/>
witnesses when God enjoined this upon you? Who is more sinful than <br/>
those who invent a lie against God to make men err without knowledge? <br/>
Verily God will not guide the wrong-doing people’ (80). 4 </p>

<p>But none has power to avoid death. </p>
<p>Many a camel silent on night journeys didst thou leave prostrate 2 <br/>
After its prodigious exertion (89). </p>
<p>THE MIGRATION OF *AUF B. LU’AYY </p>
<p>It is alleged that 'Auf b. Lu’ayy went out with a caravan of Quraysh as far <br/>
as the district of Ghatafan b. Sa'd b. Qays b. 'Aylan when he was left <br/>
behind and his tribesmen w r ent on without him. Tha'laba b. Sa'd (he <br/>
64 being his brother according to the kindred reckoning of B. Dhubyan, <br/>
Tha'laba b. Sa'd b. Dhubyan b. Baghid b. Rayth b. Ghatafan and 'Auf b. <br/>
Sa'd b. Dhubyan b. Baghid b. Rayth b. Ghatafan) came to him, bound him <br/>
to himself, gave him a wife, and took him into his tribe as a blood-brother. <br/>
His relationship became well known among B. Dhubyan. It was Tha'laba, <br/>
they say, who said to 'Auf when he lagged behind and his tribe abandoned <br/>
him: </p>
<p>Tether your camel by me, O Ibn Lu’ayy. </p>
<p>Your tribe has left you and you have no home. 3 </p>
<p>Muhammad b. Ja'far b. al-Zubayr, or it may have been Muhammad b. <br/>
'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Abdullah b. Husayn, told me that 'Umar b. al-Khattab <br/>
said: ‘If I were to claim to belong to any tribe of the Arabs or to want to <br/>
attach them to us I would claim to belong to B. Murra b. 'Auf. We know <br/>
that among them there are men like ourselves. We know, too, w r here that <br/>
man went,’ meaning 'Auf b. Lu’ayy. In the genealogy of Ghatafan he is </p>
<p>1 So C. following al-Aghani. </p>
<p>2 The dour, plodding beast that treads on through the night without uttering a sound. </p>
<p>3 Reading manzil with Tab. and MS. D in W.’s numeration. This is the best MS. used <br/>
by W., and it is strange that he should have abandoned it for the reading matrak ‘ought not <br/>
to be left’ of the majority of inferior texts. However, the latter is supported by Mufadtf, </p>
<p>p. 101. </p>
<p>The Life of Mohammad 43 </p>
<p>Nurra b. 'Auf b. Sa'd b. Dhubyan b. Baghid b. Rayth b. Ghatafan. If this <br/>
genealogy is mentioned to them they themselves say, ‘We do not deny or <br/>
contest it; it is our most prized genealogy.’ </p>
<p>Al-Harith b. Zalim b. Jadhlma b. Yarbu'—one of B. Murra b. 'Auf— <br/>
when he fled from al-Nu'man b. al-Mundhir and clave to Quraysh said: </p>
<p>My tribe is not Tha'laba b. Sa'd <br/>
Nor Fazara the long-haired. </p>
<p>My tribe if you must ask is the Banu Lu’ayy. </p>
<p>In Mecca they taught Mudar to fight. </p>
<p>We were foolish in following the Banu Baghid <br/>
And leaving our next-of-kin and family. </p>
<p>’Tw'as the folly of the water-seeker who, his fill drunk, </p>
<p>Throw's away the water and goes after a mirage. </p>
<p>’Od’s life if I had my way I should be with them <br/>
And not be found seeking pasture from place to place. </p>
<p>Rawaha the Qurayshite mounted me on his camel <br/>
And sought no reward for it (90). </p>
<p>Al-Husayn b. al-Humam al-Murri, one of B. Sahm b. Murra, said, 65 <br/>
refuting al-Harith b. Zalim and claiming to belong to Ghatafan: </p>
<p>Lo, you are not of us and we have nought to do with you. </p>
<p>We repudiate relationship with Lu’ayy b. Ghalib. </p>
<p>We dwell on the proud heights of al-Hijaz while you <br/>
Are in the verdant 1 plain between the two mountains, </p>
<p>meaning Quraysh. Afterwards al-Husayn repented of what he had said <br/>
and recognized the truth of the words of al-Harith b. Zalim. He claimed <br/>
to belong to Quraysh and, accusing himself of falsehood, he said: </p>
<p>I repent of what I said before: </p>
<p>I realize that it was the speech of a liar. </p>
<p>Would that my tongue were in tw r o, </p>
<p>Half of it dumb and the other half singing your praise. 2 <br/>
Our father a KinanI, in Mecca is his grave, </p>
<p>In the verdant 1 plain of al-Batha’ between the mountains. </p>
<p>We own a fourth of the sanctuary as an inheritance <br/>
And a fourth of the plains by the house of Ibn Hatib, </p>
<p>meaning that the B. Lu’ayy w T ere four: Ka'b, 'Amir, Sama, and 'Auf. </p>
<p>A person whom I cannot suspect told me that 'Umar b. al-Khattab said <br/>
to men of B. Murra: ‘If you wish to return to your kindred do so.’ 3 <br/>
The tribe were nobles among Ghatafan; they were their chiefs and </p>
<p>1 Or ‘contested’. 2 Lit. 'in the course of the stars’. </p>
<p>3 The importance of the genealogical tables is bound up with the control of pay and <br/>
pensions. It was 'Umar who ordered that registers should be compiled. See Sprenger, </p>

<p>leaders. Of them were Harim b. Sinan b. Abu Haritha b. Murra b. Nush- <br/>
ba; Kharija b. Sinan b. Abu Haritha; al-Harith b. 'Auf; al-Husayn b. al- <br/>
Humam; and Hashim b. Harmala of whom someone has said: </p>
<p>Hashim b. Harmala revived his father 1 <br/>
On the day of al-Haba’at and the day of al-Ya'mala 2 <br/>
You could see the kings slain beside him <br/>
As he slew the guilty and the innocent (91). 3 </p>
<p>They were a people of a lively reputation among Ghatafan and Qays, <br/>
and they retained their relationship with them. Among them the practice <br/>
of Basl obtained. 4 </p>
<p>66 According to reports Basl is the name given to eight months of the year <br/>
which the Arabs unreservedly regard as sacred. During those months they <br/>
may go wherever they like without fear of violence. Zuhayr b. Abu Sulma <br/>
said with reference to B. Murra (92): </p>
<p>Think! If they are not in al-Marurat in their dwellings <br/>
Then they will be in NakhI, 5 <br/>
A place where I have enjoyed their fellowship. </p>
<p>If they are in neither then they will be at large during the Basl. </p>
<p>He means that they will be travelling during the holy period. </p>
<p>al-A'sha of B. Qays b. Tha'laba said: 6 </p>
<p>Is your woman guest to be taboo to us </p>
<p>While our woman guest and her husband are open to you? </p>
<p>67 Ka'b b. Lu’ayy had three sons: Murra, 'Adiy, and Husays, their mother <br/>
being Wahshlya d. Shayban b. Muharib b. Fihr b. Malik b. Nadr. </p>
<p>Murra b. Ka'b had three sons: Kilab, Taym, and Yaqaza. Kilab’s <br/>
mother was Hind d. Surayr b. Tha'laba b. al-Harith b. Fihr b. Malik b. <br/>
al-Nadr b. Kinana b. Khuzayma; Yaqaza’s mother was al-Bariqiya, a <br/>
woman of Bariq of the Asd of Yaman. Some say she was the mother of <br/>
Taym; others say Tayrn’s mother was Hind d. Surayr the mother of <br/>
Kilab (93). </p>
<p>Kilab b. Murra had two sons: Qusayy and Zuhra, their mother being <br/>
Fatima d. Sa'd b. Sayal one of B. Jadara of Ju'thuma of al-Azd of Yaman <br/>
allies of B. Dil b. Bakr b. 'Abdu Manat b. Kinana (94). </p>
<p>68 Of Sa'd b. Sayal the poet says: </p>
<p>Never among men whom we know have we seen <br/>
A man like Sa'd b. Sayal. </p>
<p>1 He brought him to life as it were by taking revenge on his slayers. </p>
<p>2 Two famous battles. 3 i.e. he was not afraid of incurring a blood feud. </p>
<p>4 I have removed the chapter heading ‘The Basl ’ because it is a mere paragraph interpo¬ <br/>
lated in the genealogy which has no heading to indicate where it is resumed. </p>

<p>Qusayy b. Kilab had four sons and two daughters: 'Abdu Manaf, <br/>
'Abdu’l-Dar, 'Abdu’I-'Uzza, and 'Abdu Qusayy; and Takhmur and Barra. <br/>
Their mother was Hubba d. Hulayl b. Habashlya b. Salul b. Ka'b b. <br/>
'Amr al-Khuza'i (96). </p>
<p>'Abdu Manaf whose name was al-Mughira b. Qusayy had four sons: <br/>

Hilal b. Falij b. Dhakwan b. Tha'laba b. Buhtha b. Sulaym b. Mansur b. <br/>
'Ikrima; and Naufal, whose mother was Waqida d. 'Amr al-Mazinlya, i.e. <br/>
Mazin b. Mansur b. 'Ikrima (97). </p>
<p>THE DIGGING OF THE WELL ZAMZAM </p>
<p>While 'Abdu’I-Muttalib was sleeping in the sacred enclosure he had a <br/>
vision in which he was ordered to dig Zamzam which is a depression <br/>
between the two idols of Quraysh, Isaf and Na’ila, at the slaughter-place of <br/>
Quraysh. Jurhum had filled it in at the time they left Mecca. It is the <br/>
well of Ishmael the son of Abraham where God gave him water when he <br/>
was thirsty as a little child. His mother went to seek water for him and <br/>
could not find it, so she went up to al-Safa praying to God and imploring <br/>
aid for Ishmael; then she went to al-Marwa and did the same. God sent <br/>
Gabriel, who hollowed out a place in the earth with his heel where water <br/>
appeared. His mother heard the cries of wild beasts which terrified her on <br/>
his account, and she came hurrying towards him and found him scrabbling <br/>
with his hand at the water beneath his cheek the while he drank, and she <br/>
made him a small hole. 1 </p>
<p>JURHUM AND THE FILLING IN OF THE WELL ZAMZAM </p>
<p>The story of Jurhum, of their filling in Zamzam, of their leaving Mecca, <br/>
and of those who ruled Mecca after them until 'Abdu’I-Muttalib dug Zam- <br/>
zarp, according to what Ziyad b. 'Abdullah al-Bakka’i told me on the <br/>
authority of Muhammed b. Ishaq al-Muttalibi, is that when Ishmael the <br/>
son of Abraham died, his son Nabit was in charge of the temple as long as <br/>
God willed, then it was in charge of Mudad b. 'Amr al-Jurhumi (98). The <br/>
sons of Ishmael and the sons of Nabit were with their grandfather Mudad <br/>
b, ‘Amr and their maternal uncles of Jurhum—Jurhum and Qatura* who <br/>
were cousins being at that time the people of Mecca. They had come forth <br/>
from the Yaman and travelled together and Mudad was over Jurhum and </p>
<p>1 The narrative is continued on p. 91. </p>
<p>46 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Samayda', one of their men, over Qatura’. When they left the Y aman, they <br/>
refused to go unless they had a king to order their affairs. A hen they came </p>
<p>72 to Mecca they saw a town blessed with water and trees and, delighted with <br/>
it, they settled there. Mudad b. 'Amr with the men of Jurhum settled in <br/>
the upper part of Mecca in Qu'ayqi'an and went no farther. Samayda' <br/>
with Qatura’ settled in the lower part of Mecca in Ajyad the lower part of <br/>
Mecca, and went no farther. Mudad used to take a tithe from those who <br/>
entered Mecca from above, while Samayda' did the same to those who <br/>
entered from below. Each 'kept to his own people, neither entering the <br/>
other’s territory. </p>
<p>Then Jurhum and Qatura’ quarrelled and contended for the supremacy <br/>
in Mecca; at that time Mudad had with him the sons of Ishmael and Nabit, <br/>
and he had the oversight of the temple as against Samayda'. They went out <br/>
to fight each other, Mudad from Qu ayqi an with his horsemen making for <br/>
Samayda' equipped with spears, leather shields, swords and quivers, <br/>
rattling as they charged. It is said that Qu'ayqi'an was so named for that <br/>
reason. Samayda' went out from Ajyad with horse and foot, and it is said <br/>
Ajyad got its name from the fine horses ( jiyad ) that formed Samayda s <br/>
cavalry'. 1 The two parties met in Fadih, and after a severe battle Samayda* <br/>
was killed and Qatura’ humiliated. It is said that the name Fadih was gi\en <br/>
for this reason. Then the people clamoured for peace and went on until <br/>
they reached al-Matabikh, a ravine above Mecca; there they made peace <br/>
and surrendered authority to Mudad. W hen he was in power and held <br/>
sovereignty he slaughtered beasts for the people and gave them as food. <br/>
The people cooked and ate, and that is why the place is called Matabikli. <br/>
Some learned people allege that the name was given because d ubba had <br/>
slaughtered there and given the food away and it was his base. The dispute <br/>
between Mudad and Samayda' w'as the first open wrong committed in <br/>
Mecca, at least so some allege. </p>
<p>Then God multiplied the offspring of Ishmael in Mecca and their uncles <br/>
from Jurhum were rulers of the temple and judges in Mecca. The sons of <br/>
Ishmael did not dispute their authority because of their ties of kindred and <br/>
their respect for the sanctuary lest there should be quarrelling or fighting <br/>
therein. When Mecca became too confined for the sons of Ishmael they <br/>
spread abroad in the land, and whenever they had to fight a people, God <br/>
gave them the victory through their religion and they subdued them. </p>
<p>73 THE TRIBES OF KINANA AND KIIUZA A (JET POSSESSION </p>
<p>OF THE TEMPLE AND EXPEL JURHUM </p>
<p>Afterwards Jurhum behaved high-handedly in Mecca and made lawfful <br/>
that which w-as taboo. Those who entered the town who were not of their <br/>
tribe they treated badly and they appropriated gifts which had been made </p>
<p>1 The Cairo editors rightly reject this etymology: ajyad is the plural of }td, neck. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 47 </p>
<p>to the Ka ba so that their authority weakened. When B. Bakr b ' 4 bdu <br/>
Manat b. Kinana and Ghubshan of Khuzaa perceived that, the™ <br/>
together to do battle and drive them out of Mecca. War was declared and <br/>
in the fighting B. Bakr and Ghubshan got the upper hand and expelled <br/>
them from Mecca. Now in the time of paganism Mecca did not tolerate <br/>
injustice and wrong within its borders and if anyone did wrong therein it <br/>
expelled him; therefore it was called 'the Scorcher’, 1 and any king who <br/>
came to profane its sanctity died on the spot. It is said that it was called <br/>
Bakka because it used to break 2 the necks of tyrants when they introduced <br/>
innovations therein (99). </p>
<p>Amr b. al-Harith b. Mudad al-Jurhaml brought out the two gazelles of <br/>
the Ka ba and the corner-stone and buried them in the well Zamzam <br/>
going away with the men of Jurhum to the Yaman. They were bitterly <br/>
grieved at losing the kingship of Mecca, and the above-named 'Amr said: </p>
<p>Many a woman crying bitterly, </p>
<p>Her eyes swollen with weeping, said </p>
<p>’Tis as though between al-Hajun 3 and al-Safa there was </p>
<p>No friend and none to beguile the night’s long hours jn Mecca. </p>
<p>I said to her, while my heart within me palpitated <br/>
As though a bird fluttered between my ribs: </p>
<p>Of a surety we were its people, </p>
<p>And grievous misfortunes have brought us to nought; </p>
<p>We were the lords of the temple after Nabit, </p>
<p>We used to go round the temple <br/>
Our prosperity plain to see. </p>
<p>We were in charge of the temple after Nabit in glory 7 </p>
<p>And the man of plenty did not count with us. </p>
<p>We reigned in power, how great was our rule! </p>
<p>No other tribe there could boast. </p>
<p>Did you not marry a daughter to the best man I know? 4 <br/>
His sons are ours, we being brothers by marriage.’ </p>
<p>If the world turned against us </p>
<p>The world ever brings painful changes. </p>
<p>God 5 drove us out by force; thus, O men, </p>
<p>Does destiny pursue its way. </p>
<p>I say when the carefree sleep, and I do not sleep, </p>
<p>‘Lord of the throne, let not Suhayl and 'Amir perish!’ </p>
<p>I was forced to look upon faces I do not like: </p>
<p>The tribes of Himyar and Yuhabir. </p>
<p>We became a legend after having been in prosperity. </p>
<p>That is what the passing years did to us. </p>

<p>'Amr b. al-Harith, remembering Bakr and Ghubshan and the townsmen <br/>
of Mecca whom they had left behind there, said also: </p>

<p>THE DESPOTISM OF KHUZa'a IN THEIR CUSTODY OF <br/>
THE TEMPLE </p>
<p>Then Ghubshan of Khuza'a controlled the temple instead of B. Bakr b. <br/>
'Abd Manat, the man who was controlling it being 'Amr b. al-Harith al- <br/>
GhubshanT. Quraysh at that time were in scattered settlements, and tents <br/>
dispersed among their people, B. Kinana. So Khuza'a possessed the temple, <br/>
passing it on from son to son until the last of them, Hulayl b. Habashtya b. <br/>
Salul b. Ka'b b. 'Amr al-Khuza I (102). </p>
<p>THE MARRIAGE OF QUSAYY B. KILAB WITH HUBBA <br/>
daughter OF HULAYL </p>
<p>Ousavv b. Kilab asked Hulayl b. Hubshiya for his daughter Hubba. Hulayl <br/>
agreed and gave her to him and she bare him 'Abd al-Dar, Abd Manaf, <br/>
Abdu’l-'Uzza, and 'Abd. By the time that the children of Qusayy had <br/>
spread abroad and increased in wealth and reputation Hulayl died. Nov/ <br/>
Qusayy thought that he had a better claim than Khuza'a and B. Bakr to <br/>
control the ka'ba and Mecca, and that Quraysh were the noblest off¬ <br/>
spring of Ishmael b. Abraham and the purest descendants of his sons. <br/>
He spoke to Quraysh and B. Kinana asking them to drive out Khuza a <br/>
and B. Bakr from Mecca and they agreed to do so. </p>
<p>Now Rabi'a b. Haram of 'Udhra b. Sa'd b. Zayd had come to Mecca <br/>
after the death of Kilab and had married Fatima d. Sa'd b. Sayal. (Zuhra </p>
<p>1 Or "houses’. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 49 </p>
<p>at that time was a grown man and stayed behind, while Qu?ayy had just <br/>
been weaned.) Rabi'a took Fatima away to his land and she carried Qusayy <br/>
with her, and subsequently gave birth to Rizah. When Qu?ayy reached <br/>
man’s estate he came to Mecca and dwelt there. </p>
<p>Thus it was that when his people asked him to join them in the war he <br/>
wrote to his brother Rizah, who shared the same mother, asking him to <br/>
come and support him. Thereupon Rizah set out accompanied by his half- <br/>
brothers Hunn, Mahmud, and Julhuma, all sons of Rabi'a but not by <br/>
Fatima, together with a number of Quda'a among the Arab pilgrims, having 76 <br/>
agreed to support Qusayy. </p>
<p>Khuza'a allege that Hulayl b. Hubshiya had enjoined this on Qusayy <br/>
when he saw how his daughter’s children had multiplied, saying: ‘You <br/>
have a better right to the Ka'ba and to rule in Mecca than Khuza'a’, so that <br/>
this was the reason why Qusayy acted as he did. But this is a story which <br/>
we have not heard from any other source, and only God knows the truth. </p>
<p>(f. When the people had assembled in Mecca and gone to the mauqif <br/>
completed the hajj and come down to Mina, Qusayy assembled his posses¬ <br/>
sions and his followers from his own tribe of Quraysh, the B. Kinana, and <br/>
such of the Quda'a as were with him, there only remained the ceremony of <br/>
dismissal.) 1 </p>
<p>AL-GHAUTH’S AUTHORITY OVER MEN ON PILGRIMAGE </p>
<p>Al-Ghauth b. Murr b. Udd b. al-Ya’s b. Mudar used to give permission 2 <br/>
to men on pilgrimage to leave 'Arafa, and this function descended to his <br/>
children after him. He and his sons used to be called Sufa. 3 Al-Ghauth <br/>
used to exercise this function because his mother was a woman of Jurhum <br/>
who had been barren and vowed to Allah that if she bore a son she would <br/>
give him to the Ka'ba as a slave to serve it and to look after it. In course of <br/>
time she gave birth to al-Ghauth and he used to look after the Ka'ba in <br/>
early times with his Jurhum uncles and presided over the order of departure <br/>
from 'Arafa because of the office which he held in the Ka'ba. His sons <br/>
carried on the practice until they were cut off. </p>
<p>1 T, 1095. 12-15. The narrative goes on with the words: ‘$ufa used to send the people <br/>
away’—W. 76. 17. </p>
<p>2 ‘It seems possible that the Ijaza or “permission”, i.e, the word of command that termi¬ </p>
<p>nates the viociif, was originally the permission to fall upon the slaughtered victims. In the <br/>
Meccan pilgrimage the Ijaza which terminated the tvocuf at 'Arafa was the signal for a hot <br/>
race to the neighbouring sanctuary of Mozdalifa, where the sacred fire of the god Cozalj <br/>
burned; it was, in fact, not so much the permission to leave 'Arafa as to draw near to Cozafc. <br/>
The race itself is called Ifaja, which may mean “dispersion” or “distribution”. It cannot well <br/>
mean the former, for ‘Arafa is not holy ground, but merely the point of assemblage just <br/>
outside the at which the ceremonies began, and the station at 'Arafa is only the </p>
<p>preparation for the vigil at Mozdalifa. On the other hand, if the meaning is “distribution” <br/>
the Ifatja answers to the rush of Nilus’s Saracens to partake of the sacrifice.' W.R.S., R.S. <br/>
341 f. Cf. Wellh. 82; Gaudefroy-Demombynes, 260. </p>
<p>s The meaning of this name is obscure. </p>

<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Murr b. Udd, referring to the fulfilment of the mother’s oath, said: </p>
<p>O Lord, I have made one of my sons <br/>
A devotee in Mecca the exalted. </p>
<p>So bless me for the vow fulfilled, </p>
<p>And make him the best of creatures to my credit. </p>
<p>Al-Ghauth, so they allege, used to say when he sent the people away: </p>
<p>O God I am following the example of others. </p>
<p>If that is wrong the fault is Quda a s. </p>
<p>Yahva b. 'Abbad b. 'Abdullah b. al-Zubayr from his father 'Abbad said: <br/>
Sufa used to send the people away from 'Arafa and give them permission <br/>
to depart when they left Mina. When the day of departure arrived they <br/>
used to come to throw pebbles, and a man of Sufa used to throw or e <br/>
men, none throwing until he had thrown. Those who had urgent usmess <br/>
77 used to come and say to him: ‘Get up and throw so that we may throw with <br/>
you,’ and he would say, ‘No, by God, not until the sun goes down ; and <br/>
those who wanted to leave quickly used to throw stones at him to hurry <br/>
him, saying, ‘Confound you, get up and throw.’ But he refused until the <br/>
sun went down and then he would get up and throw while the men threw </p>
<p>stones with him. _ G _ f ,i» </p>
<p>When they had finished the stoning and wanted to leave Mina, Sufa <br/>
both sides of the hill and kept the men back. They said: ‘Chve th e order to <br/>
depart, Sufa.’ No one left until they had gone first When Sufa left an <br/>
had passed on, men were left to go their own way and followed them.. 1 his <br/>
was the practice until they were cut off. After them the next o _ n in¬ <br/>
herited. They were of B. Sa'd in the family of Safwan b. al-Harith b. <br/>
Shiina (103). It was Safwan who gave permission to the pilgrims to depart <br/>
from ‘Arafa, and this right was maintained by them up to Islam, the as </p>
<p>being Karib b. Safwan. </p>

<p>The Life of Muhammad 51 </p>
<p>Some acted unlawfully against others <br/>
And some spared not others. </p>
<p>Some of them were princes </p>
<p>Who faithfully met their obligations. </p>
<p>Some used to give men the parting signal <br/>
By custom and divine command. </p>
<p>Of them was a judge who gave decisions <br/>
And his verdict was never annulled. </p>
<p>Since the permission to depart from Muzdalifa was with ‘Adwan, as 78 <br/>
Ziyad b. 'Abdullah al-Bakka’i told me on the authority of Muhammad b. <br/>
Ishaq, they used to pass it on from father to son until the last of them when <br/>
Islam came, Abu Sayyara 'Umayla b. al-A'zal, about whom a certain poet <br/>
said: </p>
<p>We have defended Abu Sayyara <br/>
And his clients the Banu Fazara <br/>
Until he made his ass pass through safely <br/>
As he faced Mecca praying to its Guardian, </p>
<p>Abu Sayyara used to send away the people while sitting upon a she ass of <br/>
his; that is why he says ‘making his ass pass safely’. 1 </p>
<p>‘Amir b. zarib b. ‘amr b.'iyadh b. yashkur b. 'adwan </p>
<p>His words ‘a judge who gave decisions’ refers to the above-named. The <br/>
Arabs used to refer every serious and difficult case to him for decision and <br/>
would accept his verdict. Once it happened that a case in dispute in <br/>
reference to a hermaphrodite was brought to him. They said, ‘Are we to <br/>
treat it as a man or a woman ?’ They had never brought him such a difficult <br/>
matter before, so he said, ‘Wait awhile until I have looked into the matter, <br/>
for by Allah you have never brought me a question like this before.’ So <br/>
they agreed to wait, and he passed a sleepless night turning the matter over <br/>
and looking at it from all sides without any result. Now he had a slave-girl <br/>
Sukhayla who used to pasture his flock. It was his habit to tease her when <br/>
she went out in the morning by saying sarcastically, ‘You’re early this <br/>
morning, Sukhayla’; and when she returned at night he would say, ‘You’re <br/>
late to-night, Sukhayla,’ because she had gone out late in the morning and <br/>
come back late in the evening after the others. Now when this girl saw that <br/>
he could not sleep and tossed about on his bed she asked what his trouble <br/>
was. ‘Get out and leave me alone, for it is none of your business,’ he <br/>
retorted. However, she was so persistent that he said to himself that it <br/>
might be that she would provide him with some solution of his problem, so <br/>
he said: ‘Well then, I was asked to adjudicate on the inheritance of a </p>

follow the course of the urinatory process. 1 ‘Be as late as you please h <br/>
forth, Sukhayla; you have solved my problem, 1 said he. Then in the ' <br/>
ing he went out to the people and gave his decision in the way s </p>
<p>indicated. </p>
<p>HOW QUSAYY B. KILAB GAINED POWER IN MECCA; </p>
<p>HOW HE UNITED QURAYSH AND THE HELP WHICH <br/>
QUDA'A GAVE HIM </p>
<p>In that year Sufa behaved as they were accustomed. The Arabs had borne <br/>
them patiently since they felt it a duty in the time of Jurhum and Khuza a <br/>
when tfiey were in authority. Qusayy came to them with his tribesmen <br/>
from Quraysh and Kin^na and Quda'a at al-'Aqaba saying, We have a <br/>
better right to this authority than you.’ (T* They disputed one with <br/>
another Sid they tried to kill him.) Severe fighting followed resulting in <br/>
the defeat of Sufa, and Qusayy assumed their authority. . </p>
<p>Thereupon Khuza'a and B. Bakr withdrew from Qusajj knowing <br/>
he would impose the same restrictions on them as Sufa had done and that <br/>
he would come between them and the Ka'ba and the rule of Mecca. e <br/>
they had withdrawn, Qusayy showed his hostility and gathered his forces to </p>
<p>fight them. (T. His brother Rizah b. Rabi a with his men from Qu. <br/>
stood with him.) Khuza'a and B. Bakr came out against him and a severe <br/>
battle took place in the valley of Mecca and both parties suffered heavily <br/>
Thereupon they agreed to make peace and that one of the Ara ss <br/>
arbitrate between them. They appointed as umpire Tamar b Auf b. <br/>
Ka 'b b. 'Amir b. Layth b. Bakr b. ‘Abdu Manat b. Kinana. His verdict <br/>
was that Qu§ayy had a better claim to the Ka'ba and to rule Mecca than <br/>
Khuza'a and that all blood shed by Qusayy was to be cancelled andcom- <br/>
80 pensation disregarded, but Khuza'a and B. Bakr must pay bloodwit: for the <br/>
men of Quraysh, Kinana, and Quda a whom they had killed and that <br/>
Qusayy should be given a free hand with the Ka'ba and Mecca. Ya mar b. <br/>
&lt;Auf was immediately called al-Shaddakh because he had cancelled the </p>
<p>claim to bloodwit and remitted it (104). . v t </p>
<p>Thus Qusayy gained authority over the temple and Mecca and brought <br/>
inlu peop™ their dwellings to Mecca. He behaved as a king over <br/>
his tribe and the people of Mecca, and so they made him king; but he <br/>
had guaranteed to the Arabs their customary rights because he te t <br/>
that iTwas a duty upon himself which he had not the right to alter, <br/>
he confirmed the family of Safwan and 'Adwan and the intercalates and <br/>
Murra b. 'Auf in their customary rights which obtained until t e c ° mm S </p>
<p>of Islam when God put an end thereby to them all. Qusayy was the rs o </p>
<p>1 The point was important because a male received double as much as a female. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 53 </p>
<p>B. Ka'b b. Lu’ayy to assume kingship and to be obeyed by his people as <br/>
king. He held the keys of the temple, the right to "water the pilgrims from <br/>
the well of Zamzam, to feed the pilgrims, to preside at assemblies, and to <br/>
hand out the war banners. In his hands lay all the dignities of Mecca; he <br/>
divided the town into quarters among his people and he settled all the <br/>
Quraysh into their houses in Mecca which they held. </p>
<p>People assert that the Quraysh were afraid to cut down the trees of the <br/>
sanctuary in their quarters, but Qusayy cut them down with his own hand <br/>
or through his assistants. Quraysh called him the ‘uniter’ because he had <br/>
brought them together and they drew a happy omen from his rule. So far <br/>
as Quraysh wtre concerned no woman was given in marriage, no man <br/>
married, no discussion about public affairs was held, and no banner <br/>
of war was entrusted to anyone except in his house, where one of his sons <br/>
would hand it over. When a girl reached marriageable age she had to come <br/>
to his house to put on her shift. The shift was split over her head in his <br/>
house, then she put it on and was taken away to her people. 1 His authority <br/>
among the Quraysh during his life and after his death was like a religious <br/>
law which could not be infringed. He chose for himself the house of meet¬ <br/>
ing and made a door which led to the mosque of the Ka'ba; in it the <br/>
Quraysh used to settle their affairs (105). </p>
<p>'Abdu’l-Malik b. Rashid told me that his father said that he heard al- <br/>
Sa’ib b. Khabbab, author of al-Maqsura, reporting that he heard a man 8i <br/>
telling 'Umar b. al-Khattab when he was caliph the story of Qusayy, how <br/>
he united Quraysh and expelled Khuza'a and B. Bakr from Mecca, and <br/>
how he gained control of the temple and the affairs of Mecca. Umar made <br/>
no attempt to gainsay him. (T. Qusayy’s authority in Mecca, where he <br/>
enjoyed great esteem, remained uncontested. He left the pilgrimage un¬ <br/>
changed because he deemed it a religious taboo. The Sufa continued, <br/>
until they were cut off, in the family of Safwan b. al-Harith b. Shijna by <br/>
right of inheritance, 'Adwan, the Nas’a of B. Malik b. Kinana, and Murra <br/>
b. 'Auf continued as before until Islam came and God destroyed all these <br/>
offices.) </p>
<p>When Qusayy’s war was over his brother Rizah b. Rabl'a went away to <br/>
his own land with his countrymen. Concerning his response to Qusayy he <br/>
composed the following poem: </p>
<p>When a messenger came from Qusayy <br/>
And said ‘Respond to your friend’s request,’ </p>
<p>We sprang to his aid leading our horses, </p>
<p>Casting from us the half-hearted and slow-moving. </p>
<p>We rode all night until the dawn </p>
<p>Hiding ourselves by day lest we should be attacked. </p>
<p>Our steeds were swift as grouse hurrying to water <br/>
Bringing our answer to the call of Qusayy. </p>

•he can put her head. She then adds sleeves and sews up the two sides. </p>

<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>We collected tribesmen from Sirr and the two Ashmadhs 1 <br/>
From every tribe a clan. </p>
<p>What a fine force of cavalry that night, </p>
<p>More than a thousand, swift, smooth-paced! </p>
<p>When they passed by al-'Asjad <br/>
And took the easy road from Mustanakh <br/>
And passed by the edge of Wariqan <br/>
And passed by al-'Arj, a tribe encamped there, </p>
<p>They passed by the thornbushes without cropping them, 2 <br/>
Running hard the livelong night from Marr. </p>
<p>We brought the colts near their mothers <br/>
That their neighing might he gentle, </p>
<p>And when we came to Mecca we <br/>
Subdued the men tribe by tribe. </p>
<p>We smote them there with the edge of the sword <br/>
And with every stroke we deprived them of their wits. </p>
<p>We trod them down with our horses’ hooves <br/>
As the strong tread down the weak and helpless. </p>
<p>We killed Khuza'a in their homeland <br/>
And Bakr we killed group by group. </p>
<p>We drove them from God’s land, </p>
<p>We would not let them possess a fertile country. </p>
<p>We kept them bound in iron fetters. 3 <br/>
On every tribe we quenched our vengeance. </p>
<p>82 Tha'laba b. 'Abdullah b. Dhubyan b. al-Harith b. Sa'd Hudhaym al- <br/>
Quda'I said concerning Qusayy’s invitation and their response: </p>
<p>We urged on our slender high-stepping horses <br/>
From the sandhills, the sandhills of al-Jinab <br/>
To the lowlands of Tihama, and we met our foe <br/>
In a barren depression of a desert. </p>
<p>As for Sufa the effeminate, </p>
<p>They forsook their dwellings in fear of the sword. </p>
<p>But the sons of 'All when they saw us </p>
<p>Leaped to their swords like camels that yearn for home. </p>
<p>Qusayy b. Kilab said: </p>
<p>I am the son of the protectors, the B. Lu’ayy, </p>
<p>In Mecca is my home where I grew up. </p>
<p>1 It is disputed whether these are two tribes or two mountains between Medina and <br/>

<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Mine is 1 the valley as Ma'add knows, </p>
<p>Its Marwa I delight in. </p>
<p>I should not have conquered had not <br/>
The sons of Qaydhar and Nablt settled there. </p>
<p>Rizah was my helper and through him I am great, </p>
<p>I fear no injustice as long as I live. </p>
<p>When Rizah was established in his country God increased him and <br/>
Hunn in numbers. (They are the two tribes of 'Udhra today.) Now when <br/>
he came to his country there had been a matter in dispute between Rizah <br/>
on the one hand and Nahd b. Zayd and Hautaka b. Aslum on the other, <br/>
they being two clans of Quda'a. He put them in fear so that they clave to <br/>
the Yaman and left the Quda'a country' and remain in the Yaman to this <br/>
day. Now Qusayy was well disposed to Quda'a and wanted them to in¬ <br/>
crease and be united in their land because of his kinship with Rizah and <br/>
because of their goodwill to him when they responded to his appeal for <br/>
help. He disliked what Rizah had done to them and said: </p>
<p>Who will tell Rizah from me <br/>
That I blame him on two accounts, </p>
<p>I blame you for the Banu Nahd b. Zayd <br/>
Because you drove a wedge between them and me, </p>
<p>And for Hautaka b. Aslum; of a truth </p>
<p>He who treats them badly has badly treated me (106). 83 </p>
<p>When Qusayy grew old and feeble, he spoke to 'Abdu’l-Dar. He was <br/>
hisYirst born but (T. they say he was weak) 'Abdu Manaf had become <br/>
famous during his father’s lifetime and done all that had to be done along <br/>
with 'Abdu’l-'Uzza and 'Abd. He said; ‘By God, my son I will put you on a <br/>
par with the others; though they have a greater reputation than yours; none <br/>
of them shall enter the Ka'ba until you open it for them; none shall give <br/>
the Quraysh the war banner but you with your own hand; none shall drink <br/>
in Mecca except you allow it; and no pilgrim shall eat food unless you <br/>
provide it; and Quraysh shall not decide any matter except in your house.’ </p>
<p>He gave him his house, it being the only place where Quraysh could settle <br/>
their affairs, and he gave him the formal rights mentioned above. </p>
<p>The Rifada was a tax which Quraysh used to pay from their property to <br/>
Qusayy at every festival. With it he used to provide food for the pilgrims <br/>
who were unable to afford their own provisions. Qusayy had laid this as a <br/>
duty upon Quraysh, saying: ‘You are God’s neighbours, the people of his <br/>
temple and sanctuary. The pilgrims are God’s guests and the visitors to <br/>
His temple and have the highest claim on your generosity; so provide food <br/>
and drink for them during the pilgrimage until they depart out of your <br/>
territory.’ Accordingly they used to pay him every year a tax on their <br/>
flocks and he used to provide food for the people therefrom, while thev </p>

<p>56 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>were at Mina, and his people carried out this order of his during the time <br/>
of ignorance until Islam came. To this very day it is the food which the <br/>
sultan provides every year in Mina until the pilgrimage is over. </p>
<p>My father Ishaq b. Yasar from al-Hasan b. Muhammad b. 'All b. Abu <br/>
'J’alib told me about this affair of Qusayy’s and what he said to 'Abdu’l-Dar <br/>
concerning the transfer of his power to him in these words, T heard him <br/>
saying this to a man of B. 'Abdu’l-Dar called Nubaih b. Wahb b. 'Amir b. </p>
<p>84 Tkrima b. 'Amir b. Hashim b. 'Abdu Manaf b. 'Abdu’l-Dar b. Qusayy.’ <br/>
al-IJasan said: ‘Qusayy gave him all the authority that he had over his <br/>
people. Qusayy was never contradicted nor was any measure of his over¬ <br/>
thrown.’ </p>
<p>THE RIFT IN QURAYSH AFTER QUSAYY AND THE <br/>
CONFEDERACY OF THE SCENTED ONES </p>
<p>After the death of Qusayy his sons assumed his authority over the people <br/>
and marked out Mecca in quarters, after he had allotted space there for his <br/>
own tribe. They allotted quarters among their people and among other <br/>
allies, and sold them. Quraysh took part in this with them without any <br/>
discord or dispute. Then the sons of 'Abdu Manaf—'Abdu Shams and <br/>
Hashim and al-Muttalib and Naufal—agreed to seize the rights that the <br/>
sons of 'Abdu’l-Dar possessed which Qusayy had given to ‘Abdu’l-Dar <br/>
himself, namely those mentioned above. They considered that they had a <br/>
better right to them because of their superiority and their position among <br/>
their people. This caused dissension among Quraysh, one section siding <br/>
with B. 'Abdu Manaf, and the other with B. 'Abdu’l-Dar. The former <br/>
held that the new claimants had a better right; the latter that rights which <br/>
Qusayy had given to one branch should not be taken away from them. </p>
<p>The leader of B. 'Abdu Manaf was 'Abdu Shams, because he was the <br/>
eldest son of his father; and the leader of B. 'Abdu’l-Dar was 'Amir b. <br/>
H&amp;shim b. 'Abdu Manaf b. 'Abdu’l-Dar. The B. Asad b. 'Abdu’l-'Uzza b. <br/>
Qusayy and B. Zuhra b. Kilab and B. Taym b. Murra b. Ka'b and B. al- <br/>
H&amp;rith b. Fihr b. Malik b. al-Nadr were with B. 'Abdu Manaf, while with <br/>
B. 'Abdu’l-D5r were B. Makhzum b. Yaqaza b. Murra, and B. Sahm b. <br/>
'Amr b. Husay? b. Ka'b and B. Jumah b. 'Amr b. Husays b. Ka'b and <br/>
B. 'Adiyy b. Ka'b. The men who remained neutral were 'Amir b. Lu’ayy <br/>
and MuhSrib. b. Fihr. </p>
<p>85 They all made a firm agreement that they would not abandon one <br/>
another and would not betray one another as long as the sea wetted sea¬ <br/>
weed. The B. 'Abdu Man&amp;f brought out a bowl full of scent (they assert <br/>
that some of the women of the tribe brought it out to them) and they put <br/>
it for their allies in the mosque 1 beside the Ka'ba; then they dipped their <br/>
hands into it and they and their allies took a solemn oath. Then they </p>
<p>1 This it not an anachronism. See E.I., art. ‘Masdjid’. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 57 </p>
<p>rubbed their hands on the Ka'ba strengthening the solemnity of the oath. <br/>
For this reason they were called the Scented Ones. </p>
<p>The other side took a similar oath at the Ka'ba and they were called the <br/>
Confederates. Then the tribes formed groups and linked up one with <br/>
another. The B. 'Abdu Manaf were ranged against B. Sahm; B. Asad <br/>
against B. 'Abdu’l-Dar; Zuhra against B. Jumah; B. Taym against B. <br/>
Makhzum; and B. al-Harith against 'Adiyy b. Ka'b. They ordered that <br/>
each tribe should exterminate the opposing units. </p>
<p>When the people had thus decided on war, suddenly they demanded <br/>
peace on the condition that B. 'Abdu Manaf should be given the rights of <br/>
watering the pilgrims and collecting the tax; and that access to the Ka'ba, <br/>
the standard of war, and the assembly house, should belong to the 'Abdu’l- <br/>
Dar as before. The arrangement commended itself to both sides and was <br/>
carried out, and so war was prevented. This was the state of affairs until <br/>
God brought Islam, when the apostle of God said, ‘Whatever alliance there <br/>
was in the days of ignorance Islam strengthens it.’ </p>
<p>THE CONFEDERACY OF THE FUDUL 1 </p>
<p>Ziyad b. 'Abdullah al-Bakka’I related to me the following as from I bn <br/>
Ishaq: The tribes of Quraysh decided to make a covenant and assembled <br/>
for that purpose in the house of 'Abdullah b. Jud'an b. 'Amr b. Ka'b b. <br/>
Sa'd b. Taym b. Murra b. Ka'b b. Lu’ayy because of his seniority and the <br/>
high reputation he enjoyed. Those party to the agreement with him were <br/>
B. Hashim, B. ’ 1 -Muftalib, Asad b. 'Abdu’l-'Uzza, Zuhra b. Kilab, and <br/>
Taym b. Murra. They bound themselves by a solemn agreement that if <br/>
they found that anyone, either a native of Mecca or an outsider, had 86 <br/>
been wronged they would take his part against the aggressor and see that <br/>
the stolen property was restored to him. Quraysh called that confederacy <br/>
‘The Confederacy of the Fudul’. </p>
<p>Muhammad b. Zayd b. al-Muhajir b. Qunfudh al-Tayml told me that he <br/>
heard Talha b. 'Abdullah b. 'Auf al-Zuhrl say: The apostle of God said, </p>
<p>‘I witnessed in the house of 'Abdullah b. Jud'an a covenant which I would <br/>
not exchange for any number of fine camels: if I were invited to take part <br/>
in it during Islam I should do so.’ </p>
<p>Yazid b. 'Abdullah b. Usama b. al-Hadi al-Laythl told me that Muham¬ <br/>
mad b. Ibrahim b. al-Harith al-Tayml told him that there was a dispute <br/>
between al-Husayn b. 'All b. Abu Talib and al-Walld b. 'Utba b. Abu <br/>
Sufyan about some property they held in Dhu’l-Marwa. At that time al- <br/>
Walid was governor of Medina, his uncle, Mu'awiya b. Abu SufySn having <br/>
given him the appointment. Al-Walld had defrauded al-Husayn of his </p>
<p>1 Fulfil is explained as meaning that the confederates did not allow wrongdoers to retain <br/>
any stolen property. Fudul sometimes means ‘remains of spoil’. Another and somewhat <br/>
far-fetched explanation is that this covenant was modelled on an older covenant of the same <br/>
character in which three men each with the name of Fadt took part. </p>
<p>58 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>rights, for as governor he had the power to do so. Husayn said to him: ‘By <br/>
God you shall do me justice or I will take my sword and stand in the <br/>
apostle’s mosque and invoke the confederacy of the Fudul!’ 'Abdullah b. <br/>
al-Zubayr who was with al-Walid at the time said: ‘And I swear by God <br/>
that if he invokes it I will take my sword and stand with him until he gets <br/>
justice, or we will die together.’ When the news reached al-Miswar b. <br/>
Makhrama b. Naufal al-Zuhri and 'Abdu’l-Rahman b. 'Uthman b. 'Ubay- <br/>
dullah al-Tayml they said the same. As soon as he realized what was hap¬ <br/>
pening al-Walid gave al-Husayn satisfaction. </p>
<p>This same Yazld, on the same authority, told me that Muhammad b. <br/>
Jubayr b. Mut'im b. 'Adiyy b. Naufal b. 'Abdu Manaf, who was the most <br/>
learned of the Quraysh, met 'Abdu’I-Malik b. Marwan b. al-Hakam when <br/>
he had killed Ibn al-Zubayr and the people had gathered against 'Abdu’l- <br/>
87 Malik. When he went in to see him he said: ‘O Abu Sa'id, were not we and <br/>
you—meaning B. 'Abdu Shams b. Abdu Manaf and B. Naufal b. 'Abdu <br/>
Manaf—partners in the confederacy of the Fudul?’ ‘You should know r <br/>
best,’ he replied. 'Abdu’I-Malik said, ‘No, you tell me, Abu Sa'id, the <br/>
truth of the matter.’ He answered: ‘No, by God, you and we kept out of <br/>
that!’ ‘You’re right,’ said 'Abdu’I-Malik. </p>
<p>Hashim b. 'Abdu Manaf superintended the feeding 1 and watering of the <br/>
pilgrims because 'Abdu Shams was a great traveller who was seldom to be <br/>
found in Mecca; moreover he was a poor man with a large family, while <br/>
Hashim was a well-to-do man. It is alleged that when the pilgrims were <br/>
there he got up and addressed Quraysh thus: ‘You are God’s neighbours <br/>
and the people of His temple. At this feast there come to you God’s visitors <br/>
and pilgrims to His temple. They are God’s guests, and His guests have <br/>
the best claim on your generosity; so get together w r hat food they will need <br/>
for the time they have to stay here. If my own means were sufficient I <br/>
would not lay this burden upon you.’ Thereupon they taxed themselves <br/>
each man according to his capacity and used to provide food for the pil¬ <br/>
grims until they left Mecca. </p>
<p>It is alleged that Hashim was the first to institute the two caravan jour¬ <br/>
neys of Quraysh, summer and winter, and the first to provide tharXd (broth <br/>
in which bread is broken up) in Mecca. Actually his name was 'Amr, but <br/>
he was called Hashim because he broke up bread in this way for his people <br/>
in Mecca. A Quraysh poet, or one of the Arabs, composed this poem: </p>
<p>'Amr who made, bread-and-broth for his people, </p>
<p>A people in Mecca who suffered lean years. </p>
<p>He it was who started the two journeys, </p>
<p>The winter’s caravan and the summer’s train (107). </p>
<p>Hashim b. 'Abdu Manaf died in Ghazza in the land of Syria while </p>
<p>1 The rifada, feeding by means of a levy on Quraysh, has been explained above (p. 55) <br/>
and there the author of the system is said to be Qu?ayy, Probably for this reason Ibn Ishaq <br/>
discredits their tradition here by the words ‘it is alleged’. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 59 </p>
<p>travelling with his merchandise, and al-Muttalib b. ‘Abdu Manaf assumed <br/>
the right of feeding and watering the pilgrims. He w r as younger than 'Abdu <br/>
Shams and Hashim. He was held in high esteem among his people, who 88 <br/>
called him al-Fayd on account of his liberality and high character. </p>
<p>Hashim had gone to Medina and married Salma d. 'Amr, one of B. <br/>
'Adiyy b. al-Najjar. Before that she had been married to Uhayha b. al- <br/>
Julah b. al-Harish b. Jahjaba b. Kulfa b. 'Auf b. 'Amr b. 'Auf b. Malik b. <br/>
al-Aus and bore him a son called 'Amr. On account of the high position <br/>
she held among her people she would only marry on condition that she <br/>
should retain control of her own affairs. If she disliked a man she left him. </p>
<p>To Hashim she bore 'Abdu’l-Muttalib and called his name Shayba. <br/>
Hashim left him with her while he was a little boy. Then his uncle al- <br/>
Muttalib came to take him away and bring him up among his people in his <br/>
town. But Salma declined to let him go with him. His uncle argued that <br/>
his nephew was now old enough to travel and was as an exile away from <br/>
his own tribe who were the people of the temple, of great local reputation, <br/>
holding much of the government in their hands. Therefore it was better <br/>
for the boy that he should be among his own family, and therefore he <br/>
refused to go without him. It is popularly asserted that Shayba refused to <br/>
leave his mother without her consent; and this she ultimately gave. So his <br/>
uncle took him aw r ay to Mecca, riding behind him on his camel, and the <br/>
people cried: ‘It’s al-Muttalib’s slave whom he has bought’ and that is how <br/>
he got the name of 'Abdu’l-Muttalib. His uncle called out: ‘Rubbish! <br/>
This is my nephew whom I have brought from Medina.’ </p>
<p>Subsequently al-Muttalib died in Radman in the Yaman, and an Arab <br/>
mourned him in the following lines: </p>
<p>Thirsty are the pilgrims now al-Muttalib is gone. </p>
<p>No more bowls w r ith overflowing brims. </p>
<p>Now r that he is gone would that Quraysh were in torment! </p>
<p>Mafrud b. Ka'b al-Khuza'i wrote this elegy over al-Muttalib and all the <br/>
sons of 'Abdu Manaf when the news came that Naufal the last of them was <br/>
dead: </p>
<p>O night! most miserable night, </p>
<p>Disturbing all other nights, </p>
<p>With thoughts of what I suffer <br/>
From sorrow and the blows of fate. </p>
<p>When I remember my brother Naufal, 89 </p>
<p>He reminds me of days gone by, </p>
<p>He reminds me of the red waist-sashes, </p>
<p>The fine new yellow robes. </p>
<p>There were four of them, everyone a prince, </p>
<p>Sons and grandsons of princes. </p>
<p>One dead in Radman, one in Salman, </p>
<p>A third lies near Ghazza, </p>
<p>60 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>A fourth lies in a grave by the Ka'ba <br/>
To the east of the sacred buildings. </p>
<p>'Abdu Manaf brought them up virtuously <br/>
Safe from the reproof of all men. </p>
<p>Yea there are none like Mughira’s children <br/>
Among the living or the dead. </p>
<p>'Abdu Manaf’s name was al-Mughlra. Hashim was the first of his sons to <br/>
die at Ghazza in Syria, followed by 'Abdu Shams in Mecca, then al-Mutta- <br/>
lib in Radman in the Yaman, and lastly Naufal in Salman in Iraq. </p>
<p>It was said to Matrud—at least they assert so—‘Your lines are very good, <br/>
but if you had done more justice to the theme they would have been still <br/>
better.’ ‘Give me a night or two,’ he replied, and after a few days he <br/>
produced the following: </p>
<p>O eye, weep copiously, pour down thy tears, </p>
<p>Weep over Mughira’s sons, that noble breed of Ka'b, </p>
<p>O eye, cease not to weep thy gathering tears, </p>
<p>Bewail my heartfelt sorrow in life’s misfortunes. </p>
<p>Weep over all those generous trustworthy men, </p>
<p>Lavish in gifts, munificent, bounteous, </p>
<p>Pure in soul, of high intent, </p>
<p>Firm in disposition, resolute in grave affairs, </p>
<p>Strong in emergency, no churls, not relying on others, </p>
<p>Quick to decide, lavish in generosity. </p>
<p>If Ka'b’s line is reckoned, a hawk, </p>
<p>The very heart and summit of their glory, </p>
<p>Weep for generosity and Muttalib the generous, </p>
<p>Release the fountain of thy tears, </p>
<p>Gone from us in Radman today as a foreigner, </p>
<p>My heart grieves for him among the dead. </p>
<p>Woe to you, weep if you can weep, </p>
<p>For 'Abdu Shams on the east of the Ka'ba, </p>
<p>For Hashim in the grave in the midst of the desert <br/>
Where the wind of Ghazza blows o’er his bones. </p>
<p>Above all for my friend Naufal <br/>
Who found in Salman a desert grave. </p>
<p>Never have I known their like, Arab or foreigner, </p>
<p>When their white camels bore them along. </p>
<p>Now their camps know them no more <br/>
Who used to be the glory of our troops. </p>
<p>Has time annihilated them or were their swords blunt, </p>
<p>Or is every living thing food for the Fates? </p>
<p>Since their death I have come to be satisfied <br/>
With mere smiles and friendly greetings. </p>
<p>Weep for the father of the women with dishevelled hair </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 61 </p>
<p>Who weep for him with faces unveiled as camels doomed to die.’ <br/>
They mourn the noblest man who ever walked, </p>
<p>Bewailing him with floods of tears. </p>
<p>They mourn a man generous and liberal, </p>
<p>Rejecting injustice, who settled the greatest matters. </p>
<p>They weep for 'Amr al-'Ula 2 when his time came, </p>
<p>Benign was his nature as he smiled at the night’s guests. </p>
<p>They weep prostrated by sorrow, </p>
<p>How long was the lamentation and woe! </p>
<p>They mourned him when time exiled them from him, </p>
<p>Their faces pale like camels denied water. </p>
<p>With their loins girded because of fate’s hard blows. </p>
<p>I passed the night in pain watching the stars <br/>
I wept and my little daughters wept to share my grief. </p>
<p>No prince is their equal or peer, </p>
<p>Among those left behind none are like their offspring. </p>
<p>Their sons are the best of sons, </p>
<p>And they are the best of men in the face of disaster. </p>
<p>How many a smooth running fast horse have they given, </p>
<p>How many a captive mare have they bestowed, </p>
<p>How many a fine mettled Indian sword, </p>
<p>How many a lance as long as a well rope, </p>
<p>How many slaves did they give for the asking, </p>
<p>Lavishing their gifts far and wide. </p>
<p>Were I to count and others count with me <br/>
I could not exhaust their generous acts; </p>
<p>They are the foremost in pure descent <br/>
Wherever men boast of their forbears, </p>
<p>The ornament of the houses which they left <br/>
So that they have become solitary and forsaken, </p>
<p>I say while my eye ceases not to weep, </p>
<p>May God spare the unfortunate (family)! (108) </p>
<p>By the ‘father of the women with dishevelled hair’ the poet means <br/>
Hashim b. 'Abdu Manaf. </p>
<p>Following his uncle al-Muttalib, 'Abdu’l-Muttalib b. Hashim took over <br/>
the duties of watering and feeding the pilgrims and carried on the practices <br/>
of his forefathers with his people. He attained such eminence as none of <br/>
his forefathers enjoyed; his people loved him and his reputation was great <br/>
among them, </p>
<p>1 The words ‘camels doomed to die’ refer to the she-camel which used to be tethered by <br/>
the grave of her dead master until she died of hunger and thirst. The heathen Arabs believed <br/>
he would ride her in the next world. </p>

<p>THE DIGGING OF ZAMZAM </p>
<p>While Abdu’l-Muttalib was sleeping in the hijr , 1 he was ordered in a vision <br/>
to dig Zamzam. Yazld b, Abu Habib al-Misri from Marthad b. 'Abdullah <br/>
al-Yazanl from 'Abdullah b. Zurayr al-Ghafiql told me that he heard 'All <br/>
b. Abu Talib telling the story of Zamzam. He said that 'Abdu’l-Muttalib <br/>
said: ‘I was sleeping in the hijr when a supernatural visitant came and said, <br/>
“Dig Tiba”. I said “And what is Tiba?” ; then he left me. I went to bed <br/>
again the next day and slept, and he came to me and said “Dig Barra”; <br/>
when I asked what Barra was he left me. The next day he came and said <br/>
“Dig al-Madnuna”; when I asked what that was he went away again. The <br/>
next day he came while I was sleeping and said “Dig Zamzam”. I said, <br/>
“What is Zamzam?”; he said: </p>
<p>’Twill never fail or ever run dry, </p>
<p>’Twill water the pilgrim company. </p>
<p>It lies ’twixt the dung and the flesh bloody, 2 <br/>
By the nest where the white-winged ravens fly, </p>
<p>By the nest where the ants to and fro do ply.’ </p>
<p>When the exact spot had been indicated to him and he knew that it corre¬ <br/>
sponded with the facts, he took a pick-axe and went with his son al-Harith <br/>
—for the had no other son at that time—and began to dig. When the top <br/>
of the well appeared he cried 'Allah akbar!’ Thus Quraysh knew that he <br/>
had obtained his object and they came to him and said, ‘This is the well of <br/>
our father Ishmael, and we have a right to it, so give us a share in it.’ ‘I <br/>
will not,’ he answered, ‘I was specially told of it and not you, and I was the <br/>
one to be given it.’ They said: ‘Do us justice, for we shall not leave you <br/>
until we have got a judicial decision in the matter.’ He said: ‘Appoint <br/>
anyone you like as umpire between us.’ He agreed to accept a woman <br/>
diviner of B. Sa'd Hudhaym, who dwelt in the uplands of Syria, So </p>
<p>1 The frijr is the semicircular spot between the wall called Hatim and the Ka'ba, which <br/>
is said to contain the graves of Hagar and Ishmael, Cf. Az^aqi, 282 f, </p>
<p>1 The language is characteristic of Arabian oracles composed in doggerel known as Saj . <br/>
The words ‘between the dung and the blood’ occur in the Quran, Sura 16, verse 68. ‘We <br/>
give you to drink of what is in their bellies between the faeces and the blood, pure milk easily <br/>
swallowed by the drinkers.* But this throws no light on the meaning of the passage here, <br/>
which plainly has a local significance. Abu Dharr passed it by without comment. Al- <br/>
Suhayli, p. 98, sees that the term must go with the two following terms, and serve to show <br/>
exactly where Zamzam was to be found. He therefore repeats a story to the effect that <br/>
'Abdu’l-Muttalib saw the ants’ nest and the ravens’ nest when he went to dig the well, but <br/>
saw neither dung nor blood. At that moment a cow escaped her would-be butcher and <br/>
entered the fiaram. There she was slaughtered, and where the dung and blood flowed, <br/>
'Abdu’l-Muttalib proceeded to dig. This gallant attempt to explain the ancient oracle <br/>
cannot be accepted for the reason that it gives no point to the precise reference that the <br/>
well was to be found between the dung and the blood, which in this story obviously must <br/>
have occupied pretty much the same space, and indeed would render the following indica¬ <br/>
tions superfluous by giving the exact site. Most probably, therefore, we should assume that <br/>
the sacrificial victims were tethered at a certain spot and there they would void ordure <br/>
before they were led to the foot of the image at which they were slaughtered. A point <br/>
betweed these two spots is more closely defined by the ants’ and the ravens’ nest. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 63 </p>
<p>'Abdu’l-Muttalib, accompanied by some of his relations and a representa¬ <br/>
tive from all the tribes of Quraysh, rode away. They went on through <br/>
desolate country between the Hijaz and Syria until 'Abdu’l-Muttalib’s <br/>
company ran out of water and they feared that they would die of thirst. <br/>
They asked the Quraysh tribes to give them water, but they refused, on <br/>
the ground that if they gave them their water they too would die of thirst. </p>
<p>In his desperation 'Abdu’l-Muttalib consulted his companions as to what <br/>
should be done, but all they could do was to say that they would follow his <br/>
instructions: so he said, ‘I think that every man should dig a hole for him¬ <br/>
self with the strength that he has left so that whenever a man dies his com¬ <br/>
panions can thrust him into the hole and bury him until the last man, for <br/>
it is better that one man should lie unburied than a whole company.’ They <br/>
accepted his advice and every man began to dig a hole for himself. Then <br/>
they sat down until they should die of thirst. After a time 'Abdu’l-Muttalib <br/>
said to his companions, ‘By God, to abandon ourselves to death in this <br/>
way and not to scour the country in search of water is sheer incompetence; <br/>
perhaps God will give us water somewhere. To your saddles!’ So they <br/>
got their beasts ready while the Quraysh watefred them at work. 'Abdu’l- <br/>
Muttalib went to his beast and mounted her and when she got up from her 93 <br/>
knees a flow of fresh water broke out from beneath her feet. 'Abdu’l- <br/>
Muttalib and his companions, crying ‘Allah akbar!’, dismounted and drank <br/>
and filled their water-skins. Then they invited the Quraysh to come to the <br/>
water which God had given them and to drink freely. After they had done <br/>
so and filled their water-skins they said: ‘By God, the judgement has been <br/>
given in your favour 'Abdu’l-Muttalib. We will never dispute your claim <br/>
to Zamzam. He who has given you water in this wilderness is He who has <br/>
given you Zamzam. Return to your office of watering the pilgrims in <br/>
peace.’ So they all went back without going to the diviner. </p>
<p>This is the story which I heard as from All b. Abu Talib about Zamzam <br/>
and I have heard one report on ‘Abdu’l-Muttalib’s authority that when he <br/>
was ordered to dig Zamzam it was said to him: </p>
<p>Then pray for much water as crystal clear <br/>
To water God’s pilgrims at the sites they revere <br/>
As long as it lasts you’ve nothing to fear. </p>
<p>On hearing these words he went to the Quraysh and said, ‘You know that <br/>
I have been ordered to dig Zamzam for you,’ and they asked, ‘But have <br/>
you been told where it is?’ When he replied that he had not, they told him <br/>
to go back to his bed where he had the vision and if it really came from <br/>
God it would be made plain to him; but if it had come from a demon, he <br/>
would not return to him. So 'Abdu’l-Muttalib went back to his bed and <br/>
slept and received the following message: </p>
<p>Dig Zamzam, ’twill not to your hopes give lie, </p>
<p>’Tis yours from your father eternally. </p>
<p>6 4 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>’Twill never fail or ever run dry, </p>
<p>’Twill water the pilgrim company <br/>
Like an ostrich flock a fraternity, </p>
<p>Their voice God hears most graciously. </p>
<p>A pact most sure from days gone by <br/>
Nought like it canst thou descry, </p>
<p>It lies ’twixt the dung and the flesh bloody (109). 1 </p>
<p>94 It is alleged that when this was said to him and he inquired where Zamzam <br/>
was, he was told that it was by the ants’ nest where the raven will peck <br/>
tomorrow, but God knows how true this is. The next day 'Abdu’l Mu^a- <br/>
lib with his son al-Harith, who at that time was his only son, went and <br/>
found the ants’ nest and the raven pecking beside it between the two idols <br/>
Isaf and Na’ila at which Quraysh used to slaughter their sacrifices. He <br/>
brought a pick-axe and began to dig where he had been commanded. <br/>
Quraysh seeing him at work came up and refused to allow him to dig <br/>
between their two idols where they sacrificed. 'Abdu’l-Mut$alib then told <br/>
his son to stand by and protect him while he dug, for he was determined <br/>
to carry out what he had been commanded to do. When they saw that he <br/>
was not going to stop work they left him severely alone. He had not dug <br/>
deeply before the stone top of the well appeared and he gave thanks to <br/>
God knowing that he had been rightly informed. As digging went further, <br/>
he found the two gazelles of gold which Jurhum had buried there when <br/>
they left Mecca. He also found some swords and coats of mail from Qal'a. 2 <br/>
Quraysh claimed that they had a right to share in this find. 'Abdu’l- <br/>
Muftalib denied this, but was willing to submit the matter to the sacred <br/>
lot. He said that he would make two arrows for the Ka’ba, two for them, <br/>
and two for himself. The two arrows which came out from the quiver <br/>
would determine to whom the property belonged. This was agreed, and <br/>
accordingly he made two yellow arrows for the Ka'ba, two black ones for <br/>
himself, and two white ones for Quraysh. They were then given to the <br/>
priest in charge of the divinatory arrows, which were thrown beside Hubal. <br/>
(Hubal was an image in the middle of the Ka'ba, indeed the greatest of <br/>
their images. It is that referred to by Abu Sufyan ibn Harb at the battle of <br/>
Uhud when he cried ‘Arise Hubal’, i.e. Make your religion victorious!) <br/>
'Abdu’l-Muttalib began to pray to God, and when the priest threw the <br/>
arrows the two yellow ones for the gazelles came out in favour of the Ka'ba. <br/>
The two black ones allotted the swords and coats of mail to ‘Abdu’l- <br/>
Muttalib, and the two arrows of Quraysh remained behind. 'Abdu’l- <br/>
Muttalib made the swords into a door for the Ka'ba and overlaid the door <br/>
with the gold of the gazelles. This was the first golden, ornament of the <br/>
Ka'ba, at any rate so they allege. Then 'Abdu’l-Muttalib took charge of <br/>
the supply of Zamzam water to the pilgrims. </p>

Hudhayfa b. Ghanim [mentioned above] said: </p>
<p>(Weep for him) who watered the pilgrims, son of him who broke <br/>
bread 1 </p>
<p>And 'Abdu Manaf that Fihri lord. </p>
<p>He laid bare Zamzam by the Maqam, </p>
<p>His control of the,water w r as a prouder boast than any man s (i 12). </p>
<p>1076 ‘abdu’l-mutt alib&gt;s vow to sacrifice his son </p>
<p>97 </p>
<p>It is alleged, and God only knows the truth, that when ‘Abdu’l-Muttalib <br/>
encountered the opposition of Quraysh when he was digging Zamzam, <br/>
he vowed that if he should have ten sons to grow up and protect him, he <br/>
would sacrifice one of them to God at the Ka*ba. Afterwards when he had <br/>
ten sons who could protect him he gathered them together and told them <br/>
about his vow and called on them to keep faith with God. They agreed to <br/>
obey him and asked what they were to do. He said that each one of them <br/>
must get an arrow, write his name on it, and bring it to him: this they did, <br/>
and he took them before Hubal in the middle of the Ka ba. (The statue of) <br/>
Hubal 2 stood by a well there. It was that well in which gifts made to the <br/>
Ka'ba were stored. </p>
<p>Now beside Hubal there were seven arrows, each of the^n containing <br/>
some words. One was marked ‘bloodwit’. When they disputed about who <br/>
should pay the bloodwit they cast lots with the seven arrows and he on <br/>
whom the lot fell had to pay the money. Another was marked ‘yes’, and <br/>
another ‘no’, and they acted accordingly on the matter on which the oracle <br/>
had been invoked. Another w ? as marked ‘of you ; another mulsaqf another <br/>
‘not of you’; and the last was marked ‘water’. If they wanted to dig for <br/>
water, they cast lots containing this arrow and wherever it came forth they </p>
<p>1 I read khubz with most MSS. .... c r u </p>
<p>1 Cf. p. 103. T adds ‘Hubal being the greatest (or, most revered) of the idols of Quraysh <br/>
in Mecca’. J Not a mem ber of the tribe. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 67 </p>
<p>set to work. If they wanted to circumcise a boy, or make a marriage, or <br/>
bury a body, or doubted someone’s genealogy, they took him to Hubal with <br/>
a hundred dirhams and a slaughter camel and gave them to the man who cast <br/>
the lots; then they brought near the man with whom they were concerned <br/>
saying, ‘O our god this is A the son of B with W'hom we intend to do so and <br/>
so; so show the right course concerning him.’ Then they would say to the <br/>
man who cast the arrows ‘Cast!’ and if there came out ‘of you’ then he was <br/>
a true member of their tribe; and if there came out ‘not of you’ he was an 98 <br/>
ally; and if there came out mulsaq he had no blood relation to them and <br/>
was not an ally. Where ‘yes’ came out in other matters, they acted accord¬ <br/>
ingly; and if the answer was ‘no’ they deferred the matter for a year until <br/>
they could bring it up again. They used to conduct their affairs according <br/>
to the decision of the arrows. </p>
<p>'Abdu’l-Muttalib said to the man with the arrows, ‘Cast the lots for my <br/>
sons with these arrows’, and he told him of the vow which he had made. <br/>
Each man gave him the arrow on which his name was written. Now 'Ab¬ <br/>
dullah was his father’s youngest son, he and al-Zubayr and Abu Talib <br/>
were born to Fatima d. 'Amr b. 'A’idh b. 'Abd b. 'Imran b. Makhzum b. <br/>
Yaqaza b. Murra b. Ka'b b. Lu’ayy b. Ghalib b. Fihr (113). It is alleged that <br/>
'Abdullah was 'Abdu’l-Muttalib’s favourite son, and his father thought that <br/>
if the arrow missed him he would be spared. (He was the father of the <br/>
apostle of God.) When the man took the arrows to cast lots with them, <br/>
'Abdu’l-Muttalib stood by Hubal praying to Allah. Then the man cast lots <br/>
and 'Abdullah’s arrow came out. His father led him by the hand and took <br/>
a large knife; then he brought him up to Isaf and Na’ila (T. two idols of <br/>
Quraysh at which they slaughtered their sacrifices) to sacrifice him; but <br/>
Quraysh came out of their assemblies and asked what he was intending to <br/>
do. When he said that he was going to sacrifice him, they and his sons <br/>
said ‘By God! you shall never sacrifice him until you offer the greatest <br/>
expiatory sacrifice for him. If you do a thing like this there will be no <br/>
stopping men from coming to sacrifice their sons, and w ? hat will become <br/>
of the people then?’ Then said al-Mughira b. 'Abdullah b. 'Amr b. <br/>
Makhzum b. Yaqaza, 'Abdullah’s mother being from his tribe, ‘By God, <br/>
you shall never sacrifice him until you offer the greatest expiatory sacrifice <br/>
for him. Though his ransom be all our property we will redeem him.’ <br/>
Quraysh and his sons said that he must not do it, but take him to the Hijaz 1 <br/>
for there there was a sorceress who had a familiar spirit, and he must con¬ <br/>
sult her. Then he would have liberty of action. If she told him to sacrifice <br/>
him, he would be no worse off; and if she gave him a favourable response, <br/>
he could accept it. So they went off as far as Medina and found that she 99 <br/>
was in Khaybar, so they allege. So they rode on until they got to her, and <br/>
when 'Abdu’l-Muttalib acquainted her with the facts she told them to go <br/>
away until her familiar spirit visited her and she could ask him. When they <br/>
had leftdier 'Abdu’l-Muttalib prayed to Allah, and when they visited her </p>
<p>1 The region of which Medina was the centre. See Lammens, V Arabic Occidental, 300 f. </p>
<p>68 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>the next day she said, ‘Word has come to me. How much is the blood <br/>
money among you ?’ They told her that it was ten camels, as indeed it was. <br/>
She told them to go back to their country and take the young man and ten <br/>
camels. Then cast lots for them and for him; if the lot falls against your <br/>
man, add more camels, until your lord is satisfied. If the lot falls against <br/>
the camels then sacrifice them in his stead, for your lord will be satisfied <br/>
and your client escape death. So they returned to Mecca, and when they <br/>
had agreed to carry out their instructions, 'Abdu’l-Muttalib was praying <br/>
to Allah. Then they brought near 'Abdullah and ten camels while Abdu’l- <br/>
Muttalib stood by Hubal praying to Allah. Then they cast lots and the <br/>
arrow fell against Abdullah. They added ten more camels and the lot fell <br/>
against Abdullah, and so they went on adding ten at a time, until there <br/>
100 were one hundred camels, when finally the lot fell against them. Quraysh <br/>
and those who were present said, ‘At last your lord is satisfied 'Abdu’l- <br/>
Muttalib.’ ‘No, by God,’ he answered (so they say), ‘not until I cast lots <br/>
three times.’ This they did and each time the arrow fell against the camels. <br/>
They were duly slaughtered and left there and no man was kept back or <br/>
hindered (from eating them) (114). </p>
<p>OF THE WOMAN WHO OFFERED HERSELF IN MARRIAGE <br/>
TO 'ABDULLAH B. 'ABDU’L-MUTTALIB </p>
<p>Taking 'Abdullah by the hand Abdu’l-Muttalib went away and they passed <br/>
—so it is alleged—a woman of B. Asad b. 'Abdu’l-'Uzza b. Qusayy b. <br/>
Kilab b. Murra b. Ka'b b. Lu’ayy b. Ghalib b. Fihr who was the sister of <br/>
Waraqa b. Naufal b. Asad b. 'Abdu’l-'Uzza, who was at the Ka'ba. When <br/>
she looked at him she asked, ‘Where are you going Abdullah?’ He replied, <br/>
‘With my father.’ She said, ‘If you will take me you can have as many <br/>
camels as were sacrificed in your stead.’ ‘I am with my father and I cannot <br/>
act against his wishes and leave him’, he replied. </p>
<p>'Abdu’l-Muttalib brought him to Wahb b. ‘Abdu Manaf b. Zuhra b. <br/>
Kilab b. Murra b. Ka'b b. Lu’ayy b. Ghalib b. Fihr who was the leading <br/>
man of B. Zuhra in birth and honour, and he married him to his daughter <br/>
Amina, she being the most excellent woman among the Quraysh in birth <br/>
and position at that time. Her mother was Barra d. 'Abdu’l-'Uzza b. <br/>
'Uthman b. 'Abdu’l-Dar b. Qusayy b. Kilab b. Murra b. Ka'b b. Lu’ayy <br/>
iqi b. Ghalib b. Fihr. Barra’s mother was Umm Habib d. Asad b. 'Abdu’l- <br/>
'Uzza b. Qusayy by Kilab b. Murra b. Ka'b b. Lu’ayy b. Ghalib b. Fihr. <br/>
Umm Habib’s mother was Barra d. 'Auf b. 'Ubayd b. 'Uwayj b. 'Adly b. <br/>
Ka'b b.’ Lu’ayy b. Ghalib b. Fihr. </p>
<p>It is alleged that 'Abdullah consummated his marriage immediately and <br/>
his wife conceived the apostle of God. 1 Then he left her presence and met <br/>
the woman who had proposed to him. He asked her why she did not </p>
<p>1 X- ‘Muhammad.’ </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 69 </p>
<p>make the proposal that she made to him the day before; to which she <br/>
replied that the light that was with him the day before had left him, and <br/>
she no longer had need of him. She had heard from her brother Waraqa <br/>
b. Naufal, who had been a Christian and studied the scriptures, that a <br/>
prophet would arise among this people. </p>
<p>My father Ishaq b. Yasar told me that he was told that 'Abdullah went <br/>
in to a woman that he had beside Amina d. Wahb when he had been work¬ <br/>
ing in clay and the marks of the clay were on him. She put him off when <br/>
he made a suggestion to her because of the dirt that was on him. He then <br/>
left her and washed and bathed himself, and as he made his way to Amina <br/>
he passed her and she invited him to come to her. He refused and went to <br/>
Amina who conceived Muhammad. When he passed the woman again ne <br/>
asked her if she wanted anything and she said ‘No! When you passed me <br/>
there was a white blaze between your eyes and when I invited you you <br/>
refused me and went in to Amina, and she has taken it away.’ </p>
<p>It is alleged that that woman of his used to say that when he passed by <br/>
her between his eyes there was a blaze like the blaze of a horse. She said: </p>
<p>I invited him hoping that that would be in me, but he refused me and <br/>
went to Amina and she conceived the apostle of God.’ So the apostle of <br/>
God was the noblest of his people in birth and the greatest in honour both <br/>
on his father s and his mother’s side. God bless and preserve him! </p>
<p>WHAT WAS SAID TO AMINA WHEN SHE HAD CONCEIVED <br/>
THE APOSTLE </p>
<p>It is alleged in popular stories (and only God knows the truth) that Amina <br/>
d* Wahb, the mother of God s apostle, used to say when she was pregnant <br/>
with God’s apostle that a voice said to her, ‘You are pregnant with the lord <br/>
of this people and when he is born say, “I put him in the care of the One <br/>
from the evil of every envier; then call him Muhammad.’” As she was <br/>
pregnant with him she saw a light come forth from her by which she could <br/>
see the castles of Busra in Syria. Shortly afterwards 'Abdullah the apostle’s <br/>
father died while his mother was still pregnant. </p>
<p>THE BIRTH OF THE APOSTLE AND HIS SUCKLING </p>
<p>The apostle was born on Monday, 12th Rabl'u’I-awwal, in the year of the <br/>
elephant. AI-Muttalib b. 'Abdullah who had it from his grandfather Qays <br/>
b. Makhrama said, ‘I and the apostle were born at the same time in the year <br/>
of the elephant.’ (T. It is said that he was born in the house known as J. <br/>
I. Yusuf’s; and it is said that the apostle gave it to 'Aqil b. Abu Talib who <br/>
kept it until he died. His son sold it to Muhammad b. Yusuf, the brother </p>
<p>70 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>of al-Hajjaj, and he incorporated it in the house he built. Later Khayzuran <br/>
separated it therefrom and made it into a mosque.) 1 </p>
<p>Salih b. Ibrahim b. 'Abdu’l-Rahman b. 'Auf b. Yahya b. 'Abdullah b. <br/>
'Abdu’l-Rahman b. Sa'd b. Zurara al-Ansari said that his tribesmen said <br/>
that Hassan b. Thabit said: ‘I was a well-grown boy of seven or eight, <br/>
understanding all that I heard, when I heard a Jew calling out at the top of <br/>
his voice from the top of a fort in Yathrib “O company of Jews” until they <br/>
all came together and called out “Confound you, what is the matter?” He <br/>
answered: “Tonight has risen a star under which Ahmad is to be born.” ’ <br/>
103 I asked Sa'Id b. 'Abdu’l-Rahman b. Hassan b. Thabit how old Hassan <br/>
was when the apostle came to Medina and he said he was 60 when the <br/>
apostle came, he being 53, So Hassan heard this when he was seven years <br/>
old. </p>
<p>After his birth his mother sent to tell his grandfather 'Abdu’l-Muttalib <br/>
that she had given birth to a boy and asked him to come and look at him. <br/>
When he came she told him what she had seen when she conceived him <br/>
and what was said to her and what she was ordered to call him. It is alleged <br/>
999 that 'Abdu’l-Muttalib took him (T. before Hubal) in the (T. middle of <br/>
the) Ka'ba, where he stood and prayed to Allah thanking him for this gift. <br/>
Then he brought him out and delivered him to his mother, and he tried to <br/>
find foster-mothers for him (115). </p>
<p>Hallma d. Abu Dhu’ayb of B. Sa'd b. Bakr was asked to suckle him. <br/>
Abu Dhu’ayb was 'Abdullah b. al-Harith b. Shijna b. Jabir b. Rizam b. <br/>
Nasira b. Qusayya b. Nasr b. Sa'd b. Bakr b. Hawazin b. Mansur <br/>
b. 'Ikrima b. Khasafa b. Qays b. 'Aylan. </p>
<p>The prophet’s foster-father was al-Harith b. 'Abdu’l-'Uzza b. Rifa'a b. <br/>
Malian b. Nasira b. Qusayya b. Nasr b. Sa'd b. Bakr b. Hawazin (116). </p>
<p>His foster-brother was 'Abdullah b. al-Harith; Unaysa and Hudhafa 2 <br/>
were his foster-sisters. The latter was called al-Shayma’, her people not <br/>
using her proper name. These were the children of Hallma d. 'Abdullah <br/>
b. al-Harith. It is reported that al-Shayma’ used to carry him in her arms <br/>
to help her mother. </p>
<p>Jahm b. Abu Jahm the client of al-Harith b. Hatib al-Jumahl on the <br/>
authority of 'Abdullah b. Ja'far b. Abu Talib or from one who told him it <br/>
as from him, informed me that Hallma the apostle’s foster-mother used to <br/>
say that she went forth from her country with her husband and little son <br/>
whom she was nursing, among the women of her tribe, in search of other <br/>
X04 babies to nurse. This was a year of famine when they were destitute. She <br/>
was riding a dusky she-donkey of hers with an old she-camel which did not <br/>
yield a drop of milk. They could not sleep the whole night because of the <br/>
weeping of her hungry child. She had no milk to give him, nor could their </p>

freedom until after his accession and 1 . 1 . died a few years before in the reign of Man$ur, it <br/>
would seem unlikely that 1.1. should have recorded this tradition. </p>

<p>she-camel provide a morning draught, but we were hoping for rain and <br/>
relief. ‘I rode upon my donkey which had kept back the other riders <br/>
through its weakness and emaciation so that it was a nuisance to them. <br/>
When we reached Mecca, we looked out for foster children, and the apostle <br/>
of God was offered to everyone of us, and each woman refused him when <br/>
she was told he was an orphan, because we hoped to get payment from the <br/>
child’s father. We said, “An orphan! and what will his mother and grand¬ <br/>
father do?”, and so we spurned him because of that. Every woman who <br/>
came with me got a suckling except me, and when we decided to depart I <br/>
said to my husband: “By God, I do not like the idea of returning with my <br/>
friends without a suckling; I will go and take that orphan.” Her eplied, <br/>
“Do as you please; perhaps God will bless us on his account.” So I went <br/>
and took him for the sole reason that I could not find anyone else. I took <br/>
him back to my baggage, and as soon as I put him in my bosom, my breasts <br/>
overflowed with milk which he drank until he was satisfied, as also did his <br/>
foster-brother. Then both of them slept, whereas before this we could not <br/>
sleep with him. My husband got up and went to the old she-camel and lo, <br/>
her udders were full; he milked it and he and I drank of her milk until we <br/>
were completely satisfied, and we passed a happy night. In the morning <br/>
my husband said: “Do you know, Hallma, you have taken a blessed crea¬ <br/>
ture?” I said, “By God, I hope so.” Then we set out and I was riding my <br/>
she-ass and carrying him with me, and she went at such a pace that the <br/>
other donkeys could not keep up so that my companions said to me, “Con¬ <br/>
found you! stop and wait for us. Isn’t this the donkey on which you <br/>
started?” “Certainly it is,” I said. They replied, “By God, something <br/>
extraordinary has happened.” Then we came to our dwellings in the Banu <br/>
Sa'd country and I do not know a country more barren than that. </p>
<p>When we had him with us my flock used to yield milk in abundance. We <br/>
milked them and drank while other people had not a drop, nor could they <br/>
find anything in their animals’ udders, so that our people were saying to <br/>
their shepherds, “Woe to you! send your flock to graze where the daughter <br/>
of Abu Dhuayb’s shepherd goes.” Even so, their flocks came back hungry <br/>
not yielding a drop of milk, w r hile mine had milk in abundance. We ceased <br/>
not to recognize this bounty as coming from God for a period of two years, <br/>
when I weaned him. He was growing up as none of the other children <br/>
grew and by the time he was two he was a well-made child. We brought <br/>
him to his mother, though we were most anxious to keep him with us <br/>
because of the blessing which he brought us. I said to her: 1 “I should like <br/>
you to leave my little boy with me until he becomes a big boy, for I am <br/>
afraid on his account of the pest in Mecca.” We persisted until she sent <br/>
him back with us. </p>
<p>Some months after our return he and his brother were with our lambs <br/>
behind the tents when his brother came running and said to us, “Two men </p>
<p>1 T here inserts Yd Zi’ru 'O nurse!’ implying that Amina was not his mother. A strange <br/>
reading. </p>
<p>72 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>clothed in white have seized that Quraysh! brother of mine and thrown <br/>
him down and opened up his belly, and are stirring it up.” We ran towards <br/>
him and found him standing up with a livid face. We took hold of him and <br/>
asked him what was the matter. He said, ‘‘Two men in white raiment came <br/>
and threw me down and opened up my belly and searched therein for I <br/>
know not what.” 1 So we took him back to our tent. </p>
<p>His father said to me, “I am afraid that this child has had a stroke, so <br/>
take him back to his family before the result appears.” So we picked him <br/>
up and took him to his mother who asked why we had brought him when <br/>
I had been anxious for his welfare and desirous of keeping him with me. <br/>
I said to her, “God has let my son live so far and I have done my duty. I am <br/>
afraid that ill will befall him, so I have brought him back to you as you <br/>
wished.” She asked me what happened and gave me no peace until I told <br/>
her. When she asked if I feared a demon possessed him, I replied that I <br/>
106 did. She answered that no demon had any power over her son who had a <br/>
great future before him, and then she told how when she w'as pregnant with <br/>
him a light went out from her which illumined the castles of Busra in <br/>
Syria, and that she had borne him with the least difficulty imaginable. <br/>
When she bore him he put his hands on the ground lifting his head towards <br/>
the heavens. “Leave him then and go in peace,” she said/ </p>
<p>Thaur b. Yazid from a learned person who I think was Khalid b. <br/>
Ma'dan al Kala'I told me that some of the apostle’s companions asked him <br/>
to tell them about himself. He said: ‘I am what Abraham my father prayed <br/>
for and the good news of (T. my brother) Jesus. When my mother was <br/>
carrying me she saw a light proceeding from her which showed her the <br/>
castles of Syria. I was suckled among the B. Sa'd b. Bakr, and while I was <br/>
with a brother of mine behind our tents shepherding the Iambs, two men <br/>
in white raiment came to me with a gold basin full of snow Then they <br/>
seized me and opened up my belly, extracted my heart and split it; then <br/>
they extracted a black drop from it and threw it away; then they washed my <br/>
heart and my belly with that snow until they had thoroughly cleaned them. <br/>
Then one said to the other, weigh him against ten of his people; they did so <br/>
and I outweighed them. Then they weighed me against a hundred and <br/>
then a thousand, and I outweighed them. He said, “Leave him alone, for <br/>
by God, if you weighed him against all his people he would outweigh <br/>
them.” ’ </p>
<p>The apostle of God used to say, There is no prophet but has shepherded <br/>
a flock. When they said, ‘You, too, apostle of God he said ‘Yes/ </p>
<p>The apostle of God used to say to his companions, ‘I am the most Arab <br/>
of you all. I am of Quraysh, and I was suckled among the B. Sa'd b. Bakr. <br/>
It is alleged by some, but God knows the truth, that when his foster-mother <br/>
brought him to Mecca he escaped her among the crowd while she was <br/>
taking him to his people. She sought him and could not find him, so she <br/>
went to 'Abdu’l-Mutfalib and said: ‘I brought Muhammad tonight and </p>
<p>1 Cf. Sura 94. i. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 73 </p>
<p>when I was in the upper part of Mecca he escaped me and I don’t know <br/>
where he is/ So 'Abdu’l-Muttalib went to the Ka'ba praying to God to <br/>
restore him. They assert that Waraqa b. Naufal b. Asad and another man 107 <br/>
of Quraysh found him and brought him to 'Abdu’l-Mu$talib saying, ‘We <br/>
have found this son of yours in the upper part of Mecca.’ 'Abdu’l-Muttalib <br/>
took him and put him on his shoulder as he went round the Ka'ba confiding <br/>
him to God’s protection and praying for him; then he sent him to his <br/>
mother Amina. </p>
<p>A learned person told me that what urged his foster-mother to return <br/>
him to his mother, apart from what she told his mother, was that a number <br/>
of Abyssinian Christians saw him with her when she brought him back <br/>
after he had been weaned. They looked at him, asked questions about him, <br/>
and studied him carefully, then they said to her, ‘Let us take this boy, and <br/>
bring him to our king and our country; for he will have a great future. </p>
<p>We know all about him.’ The person who told me this alleged that she <br/>
could hardly get him aw 7 ay from them. </p>
<p>Amina dies and the apostle lives with his </p>
<p>GRANDFATHER </p>
<p>The apostle lived with his mother Amina d. Wahb and his grandfather <br/>
'Abdu’l-Muttalib in God’s care and keeping like a fine plant, God wishing <br/>
to honour him. When he w 7 as six years old his mother Amina died. </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr b. Muhammad b. 'Amr b. Hazm told me that the <br/>
apostle’s mother died in Abwa’ between Mecca and Medina on her return <br/>
from a visit with him to his maternal uncles of B. 'Adiy b. al-Najjar when <br/>
he was six years old (117). Thus the apostle was left to his grandfather for <br/>
whom they made a bed in the shade of the Ka'ba. His sons used to sit <br/>
round the bed until he came out to it, but none of them sat upon it out of <br/>
respect for him. The apostle, still a little boy, used to come and sit on it 108 <br/>
and his uncles would drive him away. When 'Abdu’l-Muttalib saw this <br/>
he said: ‘Let my son alone, for by Allah he has a great future.’ Then he <br/>
would make him sit beside him on his bed and would stroke his back with <br/>
his hand. It used to please him to see what he did. </p>
<p>THE DEATH OF 'ABDU’L-MUTTALIB AND THE ELEGIES </p>
<p>THEREON </p>
<p>When the apostle was eight years of age, eight years after the ‘year of the <br/>
elephant’, his grandfather died. This date was given me by al-'Abbas b. <br/>
'Abdullah b. Ma'bad b. al-'Abbas from one of his family. </p>
<p>Muhammad b. Sa'Id b. al-Musayyib told me that when 'Abdu’l-Mu^a- <br/>
lib knew that death was at hand he summoned his six daughters Safiya, <br/>
Barra, 'Atika, Umm Hakim al-Bayda’, Umayma, and Arwa, and said to </p>
<p>74 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>them, ‘Compose elegies over me so that I may hear what you are going to <br/>
say before I die.’ (118) </p>
<p>Safiya d. 'Abdu’l-Muttalib said in mourning her father: </p>
<p>I could not sleep for the voices of the keening women, </p>
<p>Bewailing a man on the crown of life’s road, </p>
<p>It caused the tears to flow </p>
<p>Down my cheeks like falling pearls </p>
<p>For a noble man, no wretched weakling, </p>
<p>Whose virtue was plain to all. </p>
<p>The generous Shayba, full of merits, </p>
<p>Thy good father inheritor of all virtue, </p>
<p>Truthful at home, no weakling, </p>
<p>Standing firm and self-reliant. </p>
<p>Powerful, fear-inspiring, massive, </p>
<p>Praised and obeyed by his people, </p>
<p>Of lofty lineage, smiling, virtuous, </p>
<p>A very rain when camels had no milk. </p>
<p>109 Noble was his grandfather without spot of shame, </p>
<p>Surpassing all men, bond or free, </p>
<p>Exceeding mild, of noble stock, </p>
<p>Who were generous, strong as lions, </p>
<p>Could men be immortal through ancient glory, </p>
<p>(Alas immortality is unobtainable!) </p>
<p>He would make his last night endure for ever <br/>
Through his surpassing glory and long descent. </p>
<p>His daughter Barra said: </p>
<p>Be generous, O eyes, with your pearly tears, </p>
<p>For the generous nature w 7 ho never repelled a beggar. </p>
<p>Of glorious race, successful in undertaking, </p>
<p>Of handsome face, of great nobility. </p>
<p>Shayba, the laudable, the noble, </p>
<p>The glorious, the mighty, the renowned, </p>
<p>The clement, decisive in misfortunes, </p>
<p>Full of generosity, lavish in gifts, </p>
<p>Excelling his people in glory, </p>
<p>A light shining like the moon in its splendour. </p>
<p>Death came to him and spared him not, </p>
<p>Change and fortune and fate overtook him. </p>
<p>His daughter 'Atika said: </p>
<p>Be generous, O eyes, and not niggardly <br/>
With your tears when others sleep, </p>
<p>Weep copiously, O eyes, with your tears, </p>
<p>While you beat your faces in w'eeping. </p>
<p>75 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Weep, O eyes, long and freely <br/>
For one, no dotard weakling, </p>
<p>The strong, generous in time of need, </p>
<p>Noble in purpose, faithful to his word. </p>
<p>Shayba the laudable, successful in undertaking, </p>
<p>The reliable and the steady, </p>
<p>A sharp sword in war <br/>
Destroying his enemies in battle, </p>
<p>Easy natured, open handed, </p>
<p>Loyal, stout, pure, good. </p>
<p>His house proudly rooted in high honour <br/>
Mounted to glory unobtainable by others. </p>
<p>His daughter Umm Hakim al-Bayda’ said: no </p>
<p>Weep, O eye, generously, hide not thy tears, </p>
<p>Weep for the liberal and generous one, </p>
<p>Fie upon thee O eye, help me <br/>
With fast falling tears! </p>
<p>Weep for the best man who ever rode a beast, </p>
<p>Thy good father, a fountain of sweet water. </p>
<p>Shayba the generous, the virtuous, </p>
<p>Liberal in nature, praised for his gifts, </p>
<p>Lavish to his family, handsome, </p>
<p>Welcome as rain in years of drought. </p>
<p>A lion when the spears engage, </p>
<p>His womenfolk look on him proudly. </p>
<p>Chief of Kinana on whom their hopes rest, </p>
<p>When evil days brought calamity, </p>
<p>Their refuge when war broke out, </p>
<p>In trouble and dire distress. </p>
<p>Weep for him, refrain not from grief, </p>
<p>Make women weep for him as long as you live. </p>
<p>His daughter Umayma said: </p>
<p>Alas, has the shepherd of his people, the generous one, perished, </p>
<p>Who gave the pilgrims their water, the defender of our fame, </p>
<p>Who used to gather the wandering guest into his tents, </p>
<p>When the heavens begrudged their rain. </p>
<p>You have the noblest sons a man could have <br/>
And have never ceased to grow in fame, O Shayba! </p>
<p>Abu’l Harith, the bountiful, has left his place, </p>
<p>Go not far for every living thing must go far. </p>
<p>I shall weep for him and suffer as long as I live. </p>
<p>His memory deserves that I suffer. </p>
<p>May the Lord of men water thy grave with rain! </p>
<p>7 6 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>I shall weep for him though he lies in the grave. </p>
<p>He was the pride of all his people, </p>
<p>And was praised wherever praise was due. </p>
<p>His daughter Arwa said: </p>
<p>My eye wept and well it did <br/>
For the generous modest father, <br/>
hi The pleasant natured man of Mecca’s vale, </p>
<p>Noble in mind, lofty in aim, </p>
<p>The bountiful Shayba full of virtues, </p>
<p>Thy good father who has no peer, </p>
<p>Long armed, elegant, tall, </p>
<p>'Twas as though his forehead shone with light, </p>
<p>Lean waisted, handsome, full of virtues, </p>
<p>Glory, rank, and dignity were his, </p>
<p>Resenting wrong, smiling, able, </p>
<p>His ancestral fame could not be hid, </p>
<p>The refuge of Malik, the spring of Fihr, </p>
<p>When judgement was sought he spoke the last word. </p>
<p>He w r as a hero, generous, liberal, </p>
<p>And bold when blood was to be shed, </p>
<p>When armed men w r ere afraid of death <br/>
So that the hearts of most of them w 7 ere as air, 1 <br/>
Forward he went wfith gleaming sword, </p>
<p>The cynosure of all eyes. </p>
<p>Muhammad b. Sa'id b. al-Musayyib told me 2 that 'Abdu’l-Muftalib <br/>
made a sign to the effect that he was satisfied with the elegies, for he could <br/>
not speak (119). </p>
<p>Hudhayfa b. Ghanim, brother of B. ‘Adly b. Ka'b b. Lu’ayy, mentioned <br/>
his superiority and that of Qusayy and his sons over the Quraysh, because <br/>
he had been seized for a debt of 4,000 dirhams in Mecca and Abu Lahab <br/>
Abdu’I-'Uzza b. Abdu’l-Muttalib passed by and redeemed him: </p>
<p>O eyes, let the generous tears flow r down the breast, </p>
<p>Weary not, may you be washed with falling rain, </p>
<p>Be generous with your tears, every morn <br/>
Weeping for a man whom fate did not spare. </p>
<p>Weep floods of tears while life does last, </p>
<p>Over Quraysh’s modest hero who concealed his good deeds, </p>
<p>A powerful zealous defender of his dignity, </p>
<p>Handsome of face, no weakling, and no braggart, </p>
<p>The famous prince, generous and liberal, </p>

<p>So that their poor are as their wealthy. </p>
<p>Munificent when times were bad, </p>

<p>Never has the necklace of a woman drooped over your like 1 <br/>

The bountiful Muttalib, father of his guests. </p>
<p>When 'Abdu’l-Muttalib died his son al-'Abbas took charge of Zamzam <br/>
and the watering of the pilgrims, although he was the youngest of his <br/>
father’s sons. When Islam came it was still in his hands and the apostle' <br/>
confirmed his right to it and so it remains with the family of al-'Abbas to <br/>
this day. </p>
<p>ABU TALIB BECOMES GUARDIAN OF THE APOSTLE <br/>
After the death of 'Abdu’l-Muttalib the apostle lived with his uncle Abu <br/>
Talib, for (so they allege) the former had confided him to his care because <br/>
he and 'Abdullah, the apostle’s father, were brothers by the same mother, <br/>
Fatima d. Amr b. 'A’idh b. 'Abd b. 'Imran b. Makhzum (121). It was <br/>
Abu Talib who used to look after the apostle after the death of his grand¬ <br/>
father and he became one of his family. </p>
<p>Yahya b. 'Abbad b. 'Abdullah b. al-Zubayr told me that his father told <br/>
him that there was a man of Lihb (122) w T ho was a seer. Whenever he came <br/>
to Mecca the Quraysh used to bring their boys to him so that he could look <br/>
at them and tell their fortunes. So Abu Talib brought him along with the 1 <br/>
others while he was still a boy. The seer looked at him and then something <br/>
claimed his attention. That disposed of he cried, ‘Bring me that boy.’ <br/>
When Abu Talib saw his eagerness he hid him and the seer began to say, <br/>
‘Woe to you, bring me that boy I saw just now, for by Allah he has a great <br/>
future.’ But Abu Talib went away. </p>
<p>THE STORY OF BAHlRA </p>
<p>Abu Talib had planned to go in a merchant caravan to Syria, and when all <br/>
preparations had been made for the journey, the apostle of God, so they <br/>
allege, attached himself closely to him so that he took pity on him and said <br/>
that he would take him with him, and that the two of them should never <br/>
part; or words to that effect. When the caravan reached Busra in Syria, <br/>
there was a monk there in his cell by the name of Bahlra, who was well <br/>
versed in the knowledge of Christians. A monk had always occupied that <br/>
cell. There he gained his knowledge from a book that was in the cell, so <br/>
they allege, handed on from generation to generation. They had often </p>
<p>1 i.e. ‘never has your equal been bom’. The figure is that of a woman nursing a baby <br/>
while her necklace falls over the child at her breast. The correct reading would seem to be <br/>
iqd not 'oqd ; dhdt nit&amp;f means ‘possessor of pendant earrings’, i.e. a woman. Dr. Arafat <br/>
suggests that 'aqd ‘girdle’ should be read and the line would then run: ‘Never has the knot <br/>
of a woman’s girdle run over your like’. The general sense would be the same, but the <br/>
particular reference would be to a pregnant woman. </p>
<p>8o </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>passed by him in the past and he never spoke to them or took any notice <br/>
of them until this year, and when they stopped near his cell he made a <br/>
great feast for them. It is alleged that that was because of something he <br/>
saw while in his cell. They allege that while he was in his cell he saw the <br/>
apostle of God in the caravan when they approached, with a cloud over¬ <br/>
shadowing him among the people. Then they came and stopped m the <br/>
shadow of a tree near the monk. He looked at the cloud when it over¬ <br/>
shadowed the tree, and its branches were bending and drooping over the <br/>
apostle of God until he was in the shadow beneath it. When Bahira saw <br/>
that, he came out of his cell and sent word to them,<em> T have prepared food <br/>
for you, O men of Quraysh, ami I should like you all to come both great <br/>
and small, bond and freed One of them said to him, By God, Bahira. <br/>
something extraordinary has happened today, you used not to treat us so, <br/>
and we have often passed by you. What has befallen you today, <br/>
answered, ‘You are right in what you say, but you are guests and I wish to <br/>
n6 honour you and give you food so that you may eat. So t ey gat ere <br/>
together with him, leaving the apostle of God behind with the aggag <br/>
under the tree, on account of his extreme youth. When Bahira looked at <br/>
the people he did not see the mark which he knew and found m his books, ^ <br/>
so he said, ‘Do not let one of you remain behind and not come to my feast. <br/>
They told him that no one who ought to come had remained be in excep <br/>
a boy who was the youngest of them and had stayed with their baggage. <br/>
Thereupon he told them to invite him to come to the meal with them. One <br/>
of the men of Quraysh said, ‘By al-Lat and al-'Uzza, we are to blame for <br/>
leaving behind (he son of 'Abdullah b. 'Abdu’l-Muttalib.’ Then he got up <br/>
and embraced him and made him sit with the people.</em> When a.ira saw <br/>
him he stared at him closely, looking at his body and finding traces of 1 1 <br/>
description (in the Christian books). When the people had finished eating <br/>
and gone away,t Bahira got up and said to him ‘Boy, I ask you by al-L <br/>
and al-'Uzza to answer my question.’ Now Bahira said this only bt <br/>
he had heard his people swearing by these gods. They allege _ a <br/>
apostle of God said to him, ‘Do not ask me by al-Lat and al- Lzza, for y <br/>
Allah nothing is more hateful tp me than these two. Bahira answere, <br/>
‘Then by Allah, tell me what I ask’; he replied, ‘Ask me what you like , s t <br/>
he began to ask him about what happened in his (T. waking and in his <br/>
sleep, and his habits, 2 and his affairs generally, and what the apostle of Go <br/>
told him coincided with what Bahira knew of his description. cn <br/>
looked at his back and saw the seal of propliethood between his shoulders <br/>
tin the very place described in his book (i2 3 ).f When he had limshcd <br/>
went to his uncle Abu Talib and asked him what relation this boy was to <br/>
him, and when he told him he was his son, he said that he was not, for i <br/>
could not be that the father of this boy was alive. ‘He is my nephew, he </p>
<p>• Lit. ‘with him’. 2 toy'*’ P crh , a n P^ , b0dy ’- </p>

</ul>
<p>f . . . t T- om - </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 81 </p>
<p>said, and when he asked what had become of his father he told him that he <br/>
had died before the child was born. ‘You have told the truth,’ said Bahira. <br/>
‘Take your nephew back to his country and guard him carefully against the <br/>
Jews, for by Allah! if they see him and know about him what I know, they <br/>
will do him evil; a great future lies before this nephew of yours, so take him 117 <br/>
home quickly.’ </p>
<p>So his uncle took him off quickly and brought him back to Mecca when <br/>
he had finished his trading in Syria. People allege that Zurayr and Tam- <br/>
mam and Daris, who were people of the scriptures, had noticed in the <br/>
apostle of God what Bahira had seen during that journey which he took <br/>
with his uncle, and they tried to get at him, but Bahira kept them away and <br/>
reminded them of God and the mention of the description of him which <br/>
they would find in the sacred books, and that if they tried to get at him <br/>
they would not succeed. He gave them no peace until they recognized the <br/>
truth of what he said and left him and went away. The apostle of God grew <br/>
up, God protecting him and keeping him from the vileness of heathenism <br/>
because he wished to honour him with apostleship, until he grew up to be <br/>
the finest of his people in manliness, the best in character, most noble in <br/>
lineage, the best neighbour, the most kind, truthful, reliable, the furthest <br/>
removed from filthiness and corrupt morals, through loftiness and nobility, <br/>
so that he was known among his people as ‘The trustworthy’ because of the <br/>
good qualities which God had implanted in him. The apostle, so I was <br/>
told, used to tell how God protected him in his childhood during the <br/>
period of heathenism, saying, ‘I found myself among the boys of Quraysh <br/>
carrying stones such as boys play with; we had all uncovered ourselves, <br/>
each taking his shirt 1 and putting it round his neck as he carried the stones. </p>
<p>I was going to and fro in the same way, when an unseen figure slapped me <br/>
most painfully saying, “Put your shirt on”; so I took it and fastened it on <br/>
me and then began to carry the stones upon my neck wearing my shirt <br/>
alone among my fellows.’ 2 </p>
<p>1 Properly a wrapper which covered the lower part of the body. </p>
<p>2 Suhayli, 120, after pointing out that a somewhat similar story is told of the prophet’s <br/>
modesty and its preservation by supernatural means, at the time that the rebuilding of the <br/>
Ka'ba was undertaken when Muhammad was a grown man, says significantly that if the <br/>
account here is correct divine intervention must have occurred twice. It may well be that <br/>
he was led to make this comment by the fact that X. omits the story altogether and in its <br/>
place (T. 1126. 10) writes: ‘I. hlamld said that Salama told him that I.I. related from <br/>

<p>Abu Talib from his father Muhammad b. 'Ali from his grandfather 'Ali b. Abu '{’alib: I <br/>
heard the apostle say, “I never gave a thought to what the people of the pagan era used to* <br/>
do but twice, because God came between me and my desires. Afterwards J never thought <br/>
of evil when God honoured me with apostleship. Once I said to a young Qurayshi who was <br/>
shepherding with me on the high ground of Mecca, ‘I should like you to look after my <br/>
beasts for me while I go and spend the night in Mecca as young men do.’ He agreed and <br/>
I went off with that intent, and when I came to the first house in Mecca I heard the sound <br/>
of tambourines and flutes and was told that a marriage had just taken place. I sat down to <br/>
look at them when God smote my ear and I fell asleep until I was woken by the sun. I <br/>
came to my friend and in reply to his questions told him what had happened. Exactly the <br/>
same thing occurred on another occasion. Afterwards I never thought of evil until God <br/>
honoured me with his apostleship.”’ </p>

<p>1 *9 THE SACRILEGIOUS WAR ( 124 ) </p>
<p>This war broke out when the apostle was twenty years of age. It was so <br/>
called because these two tribes, Kinana and Qays 'Aylan, fought in the <br/>
sacred month. The chief of Quraysh and Kinana was Harb b. Umayya b. <br/>
'Abdu Shams. At the beginning of the day Qays got the upper hand but <br/>
by midday victory went to Kinana ( 125 ). </p>
<p>THE APOSTLE OF GOD MARRIES KIIADljA ( I 26 ) </p>
<p>Khadlja was a merchant woman of dignity and wealth. She used to hire <br/>
men to carry merchandise outside the country on a profit-sharing basis, for <br/>
Quraysh were a people given to commerce. Now when she heard about <br/>
the prophet’s truthfulness, trustworthiness, and honourable character, she <br/>
sent for him and proposed that he should take her goods to Syria and trade <br/>
with them, while she would pay him more than she paid others. He was to <br/>
take a lad of hers called Maysara. The apostle of God accepted the propo¬ <br/>
sal, and the two set forth until they came to Syria. </p>
<p>The apostle stopped in the shade of a tree near a monk’s cell, when the <br/>
monk came up to Maysara and asked who the man was who was resting <br/>
120 beneath the tree. He told him that he was of Quraysh, the people who held <br/>
the sanctuary; and the monk exclaimed: ‘None but a prophet ever sat <br/>
beneath this tree.’ </p>
<p>Then the prophet sold the goods he had brought and bought what he <br/>
wanted to buy and began the return journey to Mecca. The story goes <br/>
that at the height of noon when the heat was intense as he rode his beast <br/>
Maysara saw two angels shading the apostle from the sun’s rays. When he <br/>
brought Khadija her property she sold it and it amounted to double or <br/>
thereabouts. Maysara for his part told her about the two angels who <br/>
shaded him and of the monk’s -words. Now Khadija was a determined, <br/>
noble, and intelligent woman possessing the properties with which God <br/>
willed to honour her. So when Maysara told her these things she sent to <br/>
the apostle of God and—so the story goes—said: ‘O son of my uncle I like <br/>
you because of our relationship and your high reputation among your <br/>
people, your trustworthiness and good character and truthfulness.’ Then <br/>
she proposed marriage. Now Khadija at that time was the best born <br/>
woman in Quraysh, of the greatest dignity and, too, the richest. All her <br/>
people were eager to get possession of her wealth if it were possible. </p>
<p>Khadija was the daughter of Khuwaylid b. Asad b. 'Abdu’l-'Uzza b. <br/>

<p>THE REBUILDING OF THE KA'BA WHEN THE APOSTLE <br/>
ACTED AS UMPIRE </p>
<p>Quraysh decided to rebuild the Ka'ba when the apostle was thirty-five <br/>
years of age (T. fifteen years after the sacrilegious war). They were plan¬ <br/>
ning to roof it and feared to demolish it, for it was made of loose stones <br/>
above a man’s height, and they wanted to raise it and roof it because men <br/>
had stolen part of the treasure of the Ka ba which used to be in a well in <br/>
the middle of it. The treasure was found with Duwayk a freedman of <br/>
B. Mulayh b. 'Amr of Khuza'a (130). Quraysh cut his hand off; they say <br/>
that the people who stole the treasure deposited it with Duwayk. </p>
<p>T 11 35 (T. Among those suspected were al-Harith b. Amir b. Naufal, and Abu </p>
<p>Ihab b. 'Aziz b. Qays b. Suwayd al-Tamlmi who shared the same mother, <br/>
and Abu Lahab b. 'Abdu’l-Muttalib. Quraysh alleged that it was they <br/>
who took the Ka'ba’s treasure and deposited it with Duwayk, a freedman <br/>
of B. Mulayh, and when Quraysh suspected them they informed against <br/>
Duwayk and so his hand was cut off. It was said that they had left it with <br/>
him, and people say that when Quraysh felt certain that the treasure had <br/>
been with al-Harith they took him to an Arab sorceress and in her rhymed <br/>
utterances she decreed that he should not enter Mecca for ten years be¬ <br/>
cause he had profaned the sanctity of the Ka'ba. They allege that he was <br/>
driven out and lived in the surrounding country for ten years.) </p>
<p>Now' a ship belonging to a Greek merchant had been cast ashore at <br/>
Judda and became a total wreck. They took its timbers and got them ready <br/>
to roof the Ka'ba. It happened that in Mecca there was a Copt who was a <br/>
carpenter, so everything they needed was ready to hand. Now a snake <br/>
used to come out of the well in which the sacred offerings were thrown and <br/>
sun itself every day on the wall of the Ka ba. It was an object of terror <br/>
because whenever anyone came near it it raised its head and made a rustling <br/>
noise and opened its mouth, so that they were terrified of it. While it was <br/>
thus sunning itself one day, God sent a bird which seized it and flew off <br/>
with it. Thereupon Quraysh said, ‘Now we may hope that God is pleased <br/>
123 with what we propose to do. We have a friendly craftsman, we have got <br/>
the wood and God has rid us of the snake.’ When they had decided to pull <br/>
it down and rebuild it Abu Wahb b. 'Amr b. 'A’idh b. 'Abd b. 'Imran b <br/>
Makhzum (131) got up and took a stone from the Ka'ba and it leapt out of <br/>
his hand so that it returned to its place. He said, ‘O Quraysh, do not <br/>
bring into this building ill-gotten gains, the hire of a harlot, nor money <br/>
taken in usury, nor anything resulting from wrong and violence^ People <br/>
ascribe this saying to al-Walld b. al-Mughlra b. Abdullah b. Umar b. <br/>
Makhzum. </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. Abu Najih al-Makki told me that he was told on the <br/>
authority of 'Abdullah b. Safwan b. Umayya b. Khalaf b. Wahb b. Hudhafa <br/>
b. Jumah b. 'Amr b. Husays b. Ka'b b. Lu’ayy that he saw a son of Ja'da <br/>
b. Hubayra b. Abu Wahb b. 'Amr circumambulating the temple, and when </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 85 </p>
<p>he inquired about him he was told who he was. 'Abdullah b. Safwan said, </p>
<p>‘It was the grandfather of this man (meaning Abu Wahb), who took the <br/>
stone from the Ka'ba when Quraysh decided to demolish it and it sprang <br/>
from his hand and returned to its place, and it was he who said the words <br/>
which have just been quoted.’ </p>
<p>Abu Wahb was the maternal uncle of the apostle’s father. He was a <br/>
noble of whom an Arab poet said: </p>
<p>If I made my camel kneel at Abu Wahb’s door, </p>
<p>It would start the morrow’s journey with well filled saddle-bags; </p>
<p>He was the noblest of the two branches of Lu’ayy b. Ghalib, </p>
<p>When noble lineage is reckoned. </p>
<p>Refusing to accept injustice, delighting in giving, </p>
<p>His ancestors were of the noblest stock. </p>
<p>A great pile of ashes lie beneath his cooking-pot, </p>
<p>He fills his dishes with bread topped by luscious meat. 1 </p>
<p>Then Quraysh divided the work among them; the section near the door <br/>
was assigned to B. 'Abdu Manaf and Zuhra. The space between the black 124 <br/>
stone and the southern corner, to B. Makhzum and the Qurayshite tribes <br/>
which were attached to them. The back of the Ka'ba to B. Jumah and <br/>
Sahm, the two sons of 'Amr b. Husays b. Ka'b b. Lu’ayy. The side of the <br/>
hijr to B. 'Abdu’l-Dar b, Qusayy and to B. Asad b. al-'Uzza b. Qusayy, <br/>
and to B. 'Adly b. Ka'b b. Lu’ayy which is the Hatlm. </p>
<p>The people were afraid to demolish the temple, and withdrew in awe <br/>
from it. Al-Walld b. al-Mughlra said, ‘I will begin the demolition.’ So he <br/>
took a pick-axe, went up to it saying the while, ‘O God, do not be afraid 2 <br/>
( 1 3 2 )&gt; O God, we intend only what is best.’ Then he demolished the part <br/>
at the two corners. 3 That night the people watched, saying, ‘We will look <br/>
out; if he is smitten we won’t destroy any more of it and will restore it as it <br/>
was; but if nothing happens to him then God is pleased with what we are <br/>
doing and we will demolish it.’ In the morning al-Walid returned to the <br/>
work of demolition and the people worked with him, until they got down <br/>
to the foundation <em>of Abraham.</em> They came on green stones like camel’s <br/>
humps joined one to another. </p>
<p>A certain traditionist told me that a man of Quraysh inserted a crowbar <br/>
between two stones in order to get one of them out, and when he moved the <br/>
stone the whole of Mecca shuddered so they left the foundation alone. </p>
<p>(T. so they had reached the foundation.) </p>
<p>I was told that Quraysh found in the corner a writing in Syriac. They <br/>
could not understand it until a Jew read it for them. It was as follows: ‘I <br/>
am Allah the Lord of Bakka, I created it on the day that I created heaven </p>
<p>1 Professor Afhfi reminds me that the second half of this verse is reminiscent of Imru’u’l- <br/>
Qays (1. 12) where the fine fat flesh of the camel is compared with white silk finely woven. </p>

<p>and earth and formed the sun and moon, and I surrounded it with seven <br/>
pious angels. It will stand while its two mountains stand, a blessing to its <br/>
people with milk and w r ater,’ and I was told that they found in the maqdm <br/>
a writing, ‘Mecca is God’s holy house, its sustenance comes to it from three <br/>
directions; let its people not be the first to profane it.’ </p>
<p>Layth b. Abu Sulaym alleged that they found a stone in the Ka'ba forty <br/>
years before the prophet’s mission, if w r hat they say is true, containing the </p>
<p>125 inscription ‘He that sow’eth good shall reap joy; he that soweth evil shall <br/>
reap sorrow; can you do evil and be rewarded with good? Nay, as grapes <br/>
cannot be gathered from thorns.’ 1 </p>
<p>The tribes of Quraysh gathered stones for the building, each tribe <br/>
collecting them and building by itself until the building was finished up to <br/>
the black stone, where controversy arose, each tribe wanting to lift it to its <br/>
place, until they went their several ways, formed alliances, and got ready <br/>
for battle. The B. 'Abdu’l-Dar brought a bowl full of blood; then they <br/>
and the B. 'Adiy b. Ka'b b. Lu’ayy pledged themselves unto death and <br/>
thrust their hands into the blood. For this reason they were called the <br/>
blood-lickers. Such was the state of affairs for four or five nights, and then <br/>
Quraysh gathered in the mosque and took counsel and were equally <br/>
divided on the question. </p>
<p>A traditionist alleged that Abu Umayya b. al-Mughlra b. 'Abdullah b. <br/>
'Umar b. Makhzum who was at that time the oldest man of Quraysh, urged <br/>
them to make the first man to enter the gate of the mosque umpire in the <br/>
matter in dispute. They did so and the first to come in was the apostle of <br/>
God. When they saw r him they said, ‘This is the trustworthy one. We are <br/>
satisfied. This is Muhammad.’ When he came to them and they informed <br/>
him of the matter he said, ‘Give me a cloak,’ and when it was brought to <br/>
him he took the black stone and put it inside it and said that each tribe <br/>
should take hold of an end of the cloak and they should lift it together. <br/>
They did this so that when they got it into position he placed it with his <br/>
own hand, and then building went on above it. </p>
<p>Quraysh used to call the apostle of God before revelation came to him, <br/>
‘the trustworthy one’; and w'hen they had finished the building, according <br/>
to their desire, al-Zubayr the son of 'Abdu’l-Muttalib said about the snake <br/>
which made the Quraysh dread rebuilding the Ka'ba: </p>
<p>I w r as amazed that the eagle went straight <br/>
To the snake when it was excited. </p>
<p>It used to rustle ominously <br/>
And sometimes it would dart forth. </p>
<p>126 When we planned to rebuild the Ka'ba <br/>
It terrified us for it w T as fearsome. </p>
<p>When we feared its attack, down came the eagle, </p>
<p>Deadly straight in its swoop, </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 87 </p>
<p>It bore it away, thus leaving us free <br/>
To work without further hindrance. </p>
<p>We attacked the building together, </p>
<p>We had its foundations 1 and the earth. </p>
<p>On the morrow we raised the foundation, </p>
<p>None of our workers wore clothes. </p>
<p>Through it did God honour the sons of Lu’ayy, </p>
<p>Its foundation was ever associated with them, </p>
<p>Banu 'Adiy and Murra had gathered there, </p>
<p>Kilab having preceded them. </p>
<p>For this the King settled us there in power, </p>
<p>For reward is to be sought from God (133). </p>
<p>THE HUMS </p>
<p>I do not know whether it was before or after the year of the elephant that <br/>
Quraysh invented the idea of Hums and put it into practice. They said, </p>
<p>\ e are the sons of Abraham, the people of the holy territory, the guardians <br/>
of the temple and the citizens of Mecca. No other Arabs have rights like <br/>
ours or a position like ours. The Arabs recognize none as they recognize <br/>
us, so do not attach the same importance to the outside country as you do <br/>
to the sanctuary, for if you do the Arabs will despise your taboo and will <br/>
say, “They have given the same importance to the outside land as to the <br/>
sacred territory.’” So they gave up the halt at 'Arafa and the departure <br/>
from it, while they recognized that these were institutions of the pilgrimage <br/>
and the religion of Abraham. They considered that other Arabs should <br/>
halt there and depart from the place; but they said, ‘We are the people of ,27 <br/>
the sanctuary, so it is not fitting that we should go out from the sacred <br/>
territory and honour other places as we, the Hums, honour that; for the <br/>
Hums are the people of the sanctuary.’ They then proceeded to deal in the <br/>
same way with Arabs who w'ere born within and without the sacred terri¬ <br/>
tory. Kinana and Khuza'a joined with them in this (134). </p>
<p>The Hums went on to introduce innovations for which they had no 128 <br/>
warrant. They thought it wrong that they should eat cheese made of sour <br/>
milk or clarify butter while they were in a state of taboo. They would not <br/>
enter tents of camel-hair or seek shelter from the sun except in leather tents <br/>
while they were in this state. They went further and refused to allow <br/>
those outside the haram to bring food in with them when they came on the <br/>
great or little pilgrimage. Nor could they circumambulate the house except <br/>
in the garments of the Hums. If they had no such garments they had to go <br/>
round naked. If any man or woman felt scruples when they had no hums <br/>
garments, then they could go round in their ordinary clothes; but they had </p>
<p>1 A strange place in which to find a quotation from the Gospel; cf. Mt. 7. 16. </p>
<p>Qawaid perhaps = 'uprights’. </p>
<p>88 The Life of.Muhammad </p>
<p>to throw them away afterwards so that neither they nor anyone else could </p>
<p>make use of them. 1 . .. , </p>
<p>The Arabs called these clothes ‘the cast-off . They imposed all these </p>
<p>restrictions on the Arabs, who accepted them and halted at 'Arafat, hastened <br/>
from it and circumambulated the house naked. The men at least went <br/>
naked while the women laid aside all their clothes except a shift wide open <br/>
back or front. An Arab woman who was going round the house thus said: </p>
<p>Today some or all of it can be seen, </p>
<p>But what can be seen I do not make common property! </p>
<p>Those who went round in the clothes in which they came from outside <br/>
threw them away so that neither they nor anyone else could make use ot <br/>
129 them. An Arab mentioning some, clothes which he had discarded an <br/>
could not get again and yet wanted, said: </p>
<p>It’s grief enough that I should return to her </p>
<p>As though she were a tabooed cast-off in front of the pilgrims. </p>
<p>i.e. she could not be touched. </p>
<p>This state of affairs lasted until God sent Muhammad and revealed to <br/>
him when He gave him the laws of His religion and the customs of t e <br/>
pilgrimage: ‘Then hasten onward from the place whence men hasten <br/>
onwards; and ask pardon of God, for God is forgiving merciful. The <br/>
words are addressed to Quraysh and ‘men’ refer to the Arabs So in the <br/>
rule of the hajj he hastened them up to ‘Arafat and ordered them to ha <br/>
there and to hasten thence. </p>
<p>In reference to their prohibition of food and clothes at the temple su <br/>
as had been brought from outside the sacred territory God revealed to him: <br/>
‘O Sons of Adam, wear your clothes at every mosqiie and eat and drink an <br/>
be not prodigal, for He loves not the prodigal. Say, Who has forbidden the <br/>
clothes which God has brought forth for His servants and the good things <br/>
Which He has provided ? Say, They on the day of resurrection will be on y <br/>
-for those who in this life believed. Thus do we explain the signs for people <br/>
who have knowledge.” Thus God set aside the restrictions of the Hums <br/>
and the innovations of Quraysh against men’s interests when He sent His </p>
<p>apostle with Islam. , </p>
<p>‘Abdullah b. Abu Bakr b. Muhammad b. Amr b. Hazm from bthm <br/>
b. Abu Sulayman b. Jubayr b. Mut'im from his uncle Nafi' b. Jubayr from <br/>
his father Jubayr b. Mut'im said: ‘I saw God’s apostle before revelation <br/>
came to him and lo he was halting on his beast in 'Arafat with men in the <br/>
midst of his tribe until he quitted it with them—a special grace from God </p>
<p>to him.’ </p>

<p>When he fell seriously ill she vowed that if he recovered she would make <br/>
him a Hums, and when he recovered she fulfilled her vow. . . . The Hums <br/>
strictly observed the sacred months and never wronged their proteges <br/>
therein nor wronged anyone therein. Tffey went round the Ka'ba wearing <br/>
their clothes. If one of them before and at the beginning of Islam was in a <br/>
state of taboo if he happened to be one of the housedwellers, i.e. living in <br/>
houses or villages, he would dig a hole at the back of his house and go in <br/>
and out by it and not enter by the door. The Hums used to say, ‘Do not <br/>
respect anything profane and do not go outside the sacred area during the <br/>
hajjf so they cut short the rites of the pilgrimage and the halt at 'Arafa, it <br/>
being in the profane area, and would not halt at it or go forth from it. </p>
<p>They made their stopping-place at the extreme end of the sacred territory <br/>
at Namira at the open space of al-Ma’ziman, stopping there the night of <br/>
‘Arafa and sheltering by day in the trees of Namira and starting from it to <br/>
al-Muzdalifa. When the sun turbaned the tops of the mountains they set <br/>
forth. They were called Hums because of their strictness in their religion. </p>
<p>. . . The year of Hudaybiya the prophet entered his house. One of the <br/>
Ansar was with him and he stopped at the door, explaining that he was an <br/>
AhmasI. The apostle said, ‘I am an AhmasI too. My religion and yours <br/>
are the same’, so the Ansar! went into the house by the door as he saw the <br/>
apostle do. </p>

<p>REPORTS OF ARAB SOOTHSAYERS, JEWISH RABBIS, AND <br/>
CHRISTIAN MONKS </p>
<p>130 Jewish rabbis, Christian monks, and Arab soothsayers had spoken about <br/>
the apostle of God before his mission when his time drew near. As to the <br/>
rabbis and monks, it was about his description and the description of his <br/>
time which they found in their scriptures and what their prophets had <br/>
enjoined upon them. As to the Arab soothsayers they had been visited by 7 <br/>
satans from the jinn with reports which they had secretly overheard before <br/>
they were prevented from hearing by being pelted with stars. Male and <br/>
female soothsayers continued to let fall mention of some of these matters <br/>
to which the Arabs paid no attention until God sent him and these things <br/>
which had been mentioned happened and they recognized them. When <br/>
the prophet’s mission came the satans were prevented from listening and <br/>
they could not occupy the seats in which they used to sit and steal the <br/>
heavenly tidings for they were pelted with stars, and the jinn knew that <br/>
that w r as due to an order which God had commanded concerning mankind. <br/>
God said to His prophet Muhammad when He sent him as he was telling <br/>
him about the jinn when they were prevented from listening and knew <br/>
what they knew and did not deny what they 7 saw; ‘Say 7 , It has been revealed <br/>
to me that a number of the jinn listened and said \ e have heard a wonder¬ <br/>
ful Quran which guides to the right path, and we believe in it and we will <br/>
not associate anyone with our Lord and that He (exalted be the glory of <br/>
our Lord) hath not chosen a wife or a son. A foolish one among us used to <br/>
speak lies against God, and we had thought men and jinn would not speak <br/>
a lie against God and that when men took reluge with the jinn, they <br/>
increased them in revolt,” ending with the words: We used to sit on places <br/>
therein to listen; he who listens now finds a flame waiting for him. We do <br/>
not know whether evil is intended against those that are on eaith or whether <br/>
their lord wishes to guide them in the right path . 1 When the jinn heard <br/>
the Quran they knew 7 that they had been prevented from listening before <br/>
that so that revelation should not be mingled with news from heaven so <br/>
that men would be confused with the tidings which came from God about <br/>
it when the proof came and doubt was removed; so they believed and <br/>
acknowledged the truth. Then ‘They returned to their people warning <br/>
them, saying, O our people we have heard a book which was levealed after <br/>
Moses confirming what went before it, guiding to the truth and to the <br/>
upright path.’ 2 </p>
<p>In reference to the saying of the jinn, ‘that men took refuge with them <br/>
and they increased them in revolt’, Arabs of the Quraysh and others when <br/>
they were journeying and stopped at the bottom of a vale to pass a night <br/>
131 therein used to say, ‘I take refuge in the lord of this valley of the jinn to¬ <br/>
night from the evil that is therein’ (135). </p>

<p>1 Sura 46. 28. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 91 </p>
<p>Ya'qub b. 'Utba b. al-Mughlra b. al-Akhnas told me that he was in¬ <br/>
formed that the first Arabs to be afraid of falling stars when they were <br/>
pelted with them were this clan of Thaqlf, and that they came to one of <br/>
their tribesmen called 'Amr b. Umayya, one of B. TIaj who was a most <br/>
astute and shrewd man, and asked him if he had noticed this pelting <br/>
with stars. He said: ‘Yes, but w r ait, for if they are the well-known stars <br/>
which guide travellers by land and sea, by which the seasons of summer <br/>
and winter are known to help men in their daily life, which are being <br/>
thrown, then by God! it means the end of the w'orld and the destruc¬ <br/>
tion of all that is in it. But if they remain constant and other stars are <br/>
being thrown, then it is for some purpose which God intends towards <br/>
mankind.’ </p>
<p>Muhammad b. Muslim b. Shihab al-Zuhrl on the authority of 'All b. <br/>
al-Husayn b. 'All b. Abu T’alib from 'Abdullah b. al-'Abbas from a number <br/>
of the Ansar mentioned that the apostle of God said to them, ‘What were <br/>
you saying about this shooting star?’ They replied, ‘We were saying, a <br/>
king is dead, a king has been appointed, a child is bom, a child has died.’ </p>
<p>He replied, ‘It is not so, but when God has decreed something concerning 132 <br/>
His creation the bearers of the throne hear it and praise Him, and those <br/>
below them praise Him, and those lower still praise Him because they <br/>
have praised, and this goes on until the praise descends to the lowest <br/>
heaven where they praise. Then they ask each other why, and are told <br/>
that it is because those above them have done so and they say, “Why <br/>
don’t you ask those above you the reason?”, and so it goes on until <br/>
they reach the bearers of the throne who say that God has decreed so- <br/>
and-so concerning His creation and the news descends from heaven to <br/>
heaven to the low r est heaven where they discuss it, and the satans steal it <br/>
by listening, mingling it with conjecture and false intelligence. Then they <br/>
convey it to the soothsayers and tell them of it, sometimes being wrong <br/>
and sometimes right, and so the soothsayers are sometimes right and <br/>
sometimes wrong. Then God shut off the satans by these stars w r ith <br/>
which they were pelted, so soothsaying has been cut off today and no <br/>
longer exists.’ </p>
<p>'Amr b. Abu Ja'far from Muhammad b. 'Abdu’l-Rahman b. Abu Lablba <br/>
from 'All b. al-Husayn b. 'All told me the same tradition as that of Ibn <br/>
Shihab. </p>
<p>A learned person told me that a woman of B. Sahm called al-Ghaytala <br/>
who was a soothsayer in the time of ignorance was visited by her familiar <br/>
spirit one night. He chirped beneath her, 1 then he said, </p>
<p>I know what I know, </p>
<p>The day of wounding and slaughter. </p>
<p>1 The reading here varies; the word anqada means the shriek of birds or the creaking <br/>
noise of a door, and can be applied to a man’s voice. If we read inqadda, it means the fall <br/>
or the swoop of a bird. In view of the chirping and muttering of soothsayers all the world <br/>
over, the first reading seems preferable. </p>
<p>9 2 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>When the Quraysh heard of this they asked what he meant. The spirit <br/>
came to her another night and chirped beneath her saying, </p>
<p>Death, what is death? </p>
<p>In it bones are thrown here and there. 1 </p>
<p>When Quraysh heard of this they could not understand it and decided to <br/>
wait until the future should reveal its meaning. When the battle of Badr <br/>
and Uhud took place in a glen, they knew that this was the meaning of the </p>
<p>spirit’s message (136). . </p>
<p>133 'All b. Nafi' al-Jurashl told me that Janb, a tribe from the Yaman, had a <br/>
soothsayer in the time of ignorance, and when the news of the apostle of <br/>
God was blazed abroad among the Arabs, they said to him, ‘Look into the <br/>
matter of this man for us’, and they gathered at the bottom of the mountain <br/>
where he lived. He came down to them when the sun rose and stood lean¬ <br/>
ing on his bow. He raised his head toward heaven for a long time and <br/>
began to leap about and say: </p>
<p>O men, God has honoured and chosen Muhammad, </p>
<p>Purified his heart and bowels. </p>
<p>His stay among you, O men, will be short. </p>
<p>Then he turned and climbed up the mountain whence he had come. </p>
<p>A person beyond suspicion told me on the authority of 'Abdullah b. <br/>
Ka'b a freedman of 'Uthman b. ‘AfTan that he was told that when Umar b. <br/>
al-Khattab was sitting with the people in the apostle s mosque, an Arab <br/>
came in to visit him. When 'Umar saw him he said, ‘This fellow is still a <br/>
polytheist, he has not given up his old religion yet, (or, he said), he was a <br/>
soothsayer in the time of ignorance.’ The man greeted him and sat down <br/>
and 'Umar asked him if he was a Muslim; he said that he was. He said, <br/>
‘But were you a soothsayer in the time of ignorance?’ The man replied, <br/>
‘Good God, commander of the faithful, you have thought ill of me and have <br/>
greeted me in a way that I never heard you speak to anyone of your sub¬ <br/>
jects since you came into power.’ Umar said, I ask God s pardon. In the </p>
<p>1 This ominous oracle can vie with any oracle from Delphi in obscurity. We can render, <br/>
‘Glens what are glens?’, and this, as the sequel shows, is the way Ibn Ishaq understood the <br/>
enigma when the battles of Badr and Uhud took place in glens. But such a translation ig¬ <br/>
nores the fact that the antecedent jihi (not/i 7 i«) must be a singular, and no form shu uo is <br/>
known in the singular. This translation carries with it the necessity of rendering the follow¬ <br/>
ing line thus, ‘Wherein Ka'b is lying prostrate’, and commentators are unanimous that <br/>
'Ka'b' refers to the tribe of Ka'b b. Lu’ayy, who provided most of the slain in the batt es <br/>
of Badr and Uhud and so were found ‘Thrown on their sides’. (I can find no authority or <br/>
translating ka'b by ‘heels’— -Ferseti —-as do Weil and G. Ildlscher, Die Profeten, Leipzig, <br/>
1914, p. 88. ‘Ankle’ in the singular is the meaning, and this can hardly be right.) In view <br/>
of the proof text cited by Lane, 26166, where sha'b (people) and Ka b (the tribe) and kt db <br/>
(bones used as dice like our knuckle bones) are all found in a single couplet, I am inclined to <br/>
think that the oracle is still further complicated and that a possible translation is that given <br/>
above. This, at any rate, has the merit of correct syntax since it requires us to read sha ub. <br/>
The selection of a word susceptible of so many meanings which contains the name of a <br/>
well-known tribe provides an excellent example of oracular prophecy. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 93 </p>
<p>time of ignorance we did worse than this; w r e worshipped idols and images <br/>
until God honoured us <em>with his apostle and</em> with Islam.’ The man <br/>
replied, ‘Yes, by God, I was a soothsayer.’ 'Umar said, ‘Then tell me what <br/>
(T. was the most amazing thing) your familiar spirit communicated to <br/>
you.’ He said, ‘He came to me a month or so before Islam and said: </p>
<p>Have you considered the jinn and their confusion, </p>
<p>Their religion a despair and a delusion, </p>
<p>Clinging to their camels’ saddle cloths in profusion?’ (137). 134 </p>
<p>‘Abdullah b. Ka'b said, Thereupon 'Umar said, ‘I was standing by an <br/>
idol with a number of the Quraysh in the time of ignorance when an Arab <br/>
sacrificed a calf. We were standing by expecting to get a part of it, when I <br/>
heard a voice more penetrating than I have ever heard coming out of the <br/>
belly of the calf (this was a month or so before Islam), saying: </p>
<p>O blood red one, </p>
<p>The deed is done, </p>
<p>A man will cry <br/>
Beside God none.’ (138) </p>
<p>Such is what I have been told about soothsayers among the Arabs. 1 </p>
<p>THE JEWISH WARNING ABOUT THE APOSTLE OF GOD </p>
<p>'Asim b. 'Umar b. Qatada told me that some of his tribesmen said: ‘What <br/>
induced us to accept Islam, apart from God’s mercy and guidance, was <br/>
what we used to hear the Jews say. We were polytheists worshipping <br/>
idols, while they were people of the scriptures with knowledge which we <br/>
did not possess. There was continual enmity between us, and "when we got <br/>
the better of them and excited their hate, they said, “The time of a prophet <br/>
who is to be sent has now come. We w r ill kill you with his aid as 'Ad and <br/>
Iram perished.’’ 2 We often used to hear them say this. When God sent <br/>
His apostle we accepted him when he called us to God and we realized <br/>
what their threat meant and joined him before them. We believed in him <br/>
but they denied him. Concerning us and them, God revealed the verse in <br/>
the chapter of the Cow: “And when a book from God came to them con¬ <br/>
firming what they already had (and they were formerly asking for victory <br/>
over the unbelievers), when what they knew came to them, they disbelieved <br/>
it. The curse of God is on the unbelievers.” ’ (139) 3 </p>
<p>Salih b. Ibrahim b. 'Abdu’l-Rahman b. 'Auf from Mahmud b. Labld, <br/>
brother of B. 'Abdu’l-Ashhal, from Salama b. Salama b. Waqsh (Salama 135 <br/>
was present at Badr) said: ‘We had a Jewish neighbour among B. ‘Abdu’l- <br/>
Ashhal, who came out to us one day from his house. (At that time I was the </p>

<p>youngest person in my house, wearing a small robe and lying m the court¬ <br/>
yard ) He spoke of the resurrection, the reckoning, the scales, paradise, <br/>
and hell. When he spoke of these things to the polytheists who thought <br/>
that there could be no rising after death, they said to him, “Good gracious <br/>
man! Do you think that such things could be that men can be raised from <br/>
the dead to a place where there is a garden and a fire in which they wil e <br/>
recompensed for their deeds?” “Yes,” he said, “and by Him whom men <br/>
swear by, he would wish that he might be in the largest oven in his house <br/>
rather than in that fire: that they would heat it and thrust him into it an ^ <br/>
plaster it over if he could get out from that fire on the following day. <br/>
When they asked for a sign that this would be, he said pointing wi ms <br/>
hand to Mecca and the Yaman, “A prophet will be sent from the direction <br/>
of this land.” When they asked when he would appear, he looked at me <br/>
the youngest person, and said: “This boy, if he lives his natural term, will <br/>
see him,” and by God, a night and a day did not pass before God sent <br/>
Muhammad his apostle and he was living among us. We believed in him <br/>
but he denied him in his wickedness and envy. When we asked, Aren t <br/>
you the man who said these things ?” he said, “Certainly, but this is no </p>

said to me, ‘Do you know how Tha'laba b. Sa'ya and Asld b. ba ya an <br/>
Asad b. 'Ubayd of B. Hadl, brothers of B. Qurayza, became Muslims. <br/>
They were with them during the days of ignorance; then they ecame t leir <br/>
masters in Islam.’ When I said that I did not know he told me that a Jew <br/>
from Syria, Ibnu’l-Hayyaban, came to us some years before Islam and dw e t <br/>
136 among us. ‘I have never seen a better man than he who was not a Muslim. <br/>
When we were living in the time of drought we asked him to come with us <br/>
and pray for rain. He declined to do so unless we paid him something, <br/>
and when we asked how much he wanted, he said, “A bushel of dates or <br/>
two bushels of barley.” When we had duly paid up he went outside our <br/>

that he P had come to this country expecting to see the emergence o <br/>
prophet whose time was at hand. This was the town where he would <br/>
migrate and he was hoping that he would be sent so that he could follow <br/>
him. “His time has come,” he said, "and don't let anyone get to him before <br/>

<p>The Life of Muhammad 95 </p>
<p>asserted that he had been accurately described, so they went and became <br/>
Muslims and saved their lives, their property, and their families. Such is <br/>
what I have been told about the Jewish reports. 1 </p>
<p>HOW SALMAN BECAME A MUSLIM </p>
<p>*Asim b. 'Umar b. Qatada al-Ansari told me on the authority of Mahmud <br/>
b. Labid from 'Abdullah b. 'Abbas as follows: Salman said while I listened <br/>
to his words: ‘I am a Persian from Ispahan from a village called Jayy. My 137 <br/>
father was the principal landowner in his village and I was dearer to him <br/>
than the whole world. His love for me went to such lengths that he shut <br/>
me in his house as though I were a slave girl. I was such a zealous Magian <br/>
that I became keeper of the sacred fire, replenishing it and not letting it go <br/>
out for a moment. Now my father owned a large farm, and one day when <br/>
he could not attend to his farm he told me to go to it and learn about it, <br/>
giving me certain instructions. “Do not let yourself be detained,” he said, <br/>
“because you are more important to me than my farm and worrying about <br/>
you will prevent me going about my business.” So I started out for the <br/>
farm, and when I passed by a Christian church I heard the voices of the <br/>
men praying. I knew nothing about them because my father kept me shut <br/>
up in his house. When I heard their voices I went to see what they were <br/>
doing; their prayers pleased me and I felt drawn to their worship and <br/>
thought that it was better than our religion, and I decided that I would not <br/>
leave them until sunset. So I did not go to the farm. When I asked them <br/>
where their religion originated, they said “Syria”, I returned to my father <br/>
who had sent after me because anxiety on my account had interrupted all <br/>
his work. He asked me where I had been and reproached me for not obey¬ <br/>
ing his instructions. I told him that I had passed by some men who were <br/>
praying in their church and was so pleased with what I saw of their religion <br/>
that I stayed with them until sunset. He said, “My son, there is no good in <br/>
that religion; the religion of your fathers is better than that.” “No,” I said, </p>
<p>“It is better than our religion.” My father was afraid of what I would do, so <br/>
he bound me in fetters and imprisoned me in his house. </p>
<p>‘I sent to the Christians and asked them if they would tell me when a <br/>
caravan of Christian merchants came from Syria. They told me, and I said <br/>
to them: “When they have finished their business and want to go back to <br/>
their own country, ask them if they will take me.” They did so and I cast <br/>
off the fetters from my feet and went with them to Syria. Arrived there I 138 <br/>
asked for the most learned person in their religion and they directed me to <br/>
the bishop. I went to him and told him that I liked his religion and should <br/>
like to be with him and serve him in his church, to learn from him and to <br/>
pray with him. He invited me to come in and I did so. Now he was a <br/>
bad man who used to command people to give alms and induced them to </p>

Jewish rabbis’. </p>
<p>9 6 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>do so and when they brought him money he put it in his own coffers and <br/>
did not give it to the poor, until he had collected seven jars of gold and <br/>
silver I conceived a violent hatred for the man when I saw what he was <br/>
doing. Sometime later when he died and the Christians came together to <br/>
bury him I told them that he was a bad man who exhorted them and per¬ <br/>
suaded them to give alms, and when they brought money put it m his <br/>
coffers and gave nothing to the poor. They asked how I could possi ly <br/>
know this, so I led them to his treasure and when I showed them the p ace <br/>
they brought out seven jars full of gold and silver. As soon as they saw <br/>
them they said, “By God, we will never bury the fellow,’’ so they crucified <br/>
him and stoned him and appointed another in his place. </p>
<p>‘I have never seen any non-Muslim whom I consider more virtuous <br/>
more ascetic, more devoted to the next life, and more consistent night and <br/>
day than he. I loved him as I had never loved anyone before. I stayed <br/>
with him a long time until when he was about to die I told him how I loved <br/>
him and asked him to whom he would confide me and what orders he <br/>
would give me now that he was about to die. He said, My dear son, I do <br/>
not know anyone who is as I am. Men have died and have either altered or <br/>
abandoned most of their true religion, except a man in Mausil; he follows <br/>
my faith, so join yourself to him. So when he died and was buried, 1 <br/>
attached myself to the bishop of Mausil telling him that so-and-so had <br/>
confided me to him when he died and told me that he followed the same <br/>
139 path. I stayed with him and found him just as he had been described, but <br/>
it W as not long before he died and I asked him to do for me what his pre¬ <br/>
decessor had done. He replied that he knew of only one man, in Najibin, <br/>
who followed the same path and he recommended me to go to him. </p>
<p>‘I stayed with this good man in Naslbin for some time and when he died <br/>
he recommended me to go to a colleague in 'Ammuriya. I stayed with him <br/>
for some time and laboured until I possessed some cows and a small hock <br/>
of sheep; then when he was about to die I asked him to recommend me to <br/>
someone else. He told me that he knew of no one who followed his way of <br/>
life but that a prophet was about to arise who. would be sent with the <br/>
religion of Abraham; he would come forth in Arabia and would migrate to <br/>
a country between two lava belts, between which were palms. He has un¬ <br/>
mistakable marks. He will eat what is given to him but not things given <br/>
*s alms. Between his shoulders is the seal of prophecy. “If you are able to <br/>
go to that country, do so.” Then he died and was buried and I stayed m <br/>
140 'Ammuriya as long as God willed. Then a party of Kalbite merchants <br/>
passed by and I asked them to take me to Arabia and I would give them <br/>
those cows and sheep of mine. They accepted the offer and took me with <br/>
them until we reached Wadi’l-Qura, "when they sold me to a Jew as a s ave. </p>

<p>The Life of Muhammad 97 </p>
<p>I saw the palm-trees and I hoped that this would be the town which my <br/>
master had described to me, for I w'as not certain. Then a cousin of his <br/>
from B. Qurayza of Medina came and bought me and carried me away to <br/>
Medina, and, by God, as soon as I saw it I recognized it from my master’s <br/>
description. I dwelt there and the apostle of God w r as sent and lived in <br/>
Mecca; but I did not hear him mentioned because I w r as fully occupied as a <br/>
slave. Then he migrated to Medina and as I was in the top of a palm-tree <br/>
belonging to my master, carrying out my work while my master sat below, <br/>
suddenly a cousin of his came up to him and said: “God smite the B. <br/>
Qayla! They are gathering at this moment in Quba’ round a man who has <br/>
come to them from Mecca today asserting that he is a prophet.” (140) </p>
<p>‘When I heard this I was seized with trembling (141), so that I thought <br/>
I should fall on my master; so I came down from the palm and began to <br/>
say to his cousin, “What did you say? What did you say?” My master <br/>
was angered and gave me a smart blow, saying, “What do you mean by <br/>
this? Get back to your w'ork.” I said, “Never mind, I only wanted to find <br/>
out the truth of his report.” Now I had a little food which I had gathered, 141 <br/>
and I took it that evening to the apostle of God who was in Quba’ and said, </p>
<p>“I have heard that you are an honest man and that your companions are <br/>
strangers in want; here is something for alms, for I think that you have <br/>
more right to it than others.” So I gave it to him. The apostle said to his <br/>
companions, “Eat!” but he did not hold out his own hand and did not eat. </p>
<p>I said to myself, “That is one;” then I left him and collected some food <br/>
and the apostle went to Medina. Then I brought it to him and said, “I see <br/>
that you do not eat food given as alms, here is a present which I freely give <br/>
you.” The apostle ate it and gave his companions some. I said, “That’s <br/>
two;” then I came to the apostle when he was in Baqi'u-’l-Gharqad 1 where <br/>
he had followed the bier of one of his companions. Now I had two cloaks, <br/>
and as he was sitting with his companions, I saluted him and went round <br/>
to look at his back so that I could see whether the seal which my master <br/>
had described to me was there. When the apostle saw me looking at his <br/>
back he knew that I was trying to find out the truth of what had been <br/>
described to me, so he threw off his cloak laying bare his back and I looked <br/>
at the seal and recognized it. Then I bent over him 2 kissing him 2 and w’eep- <br/>
ing. The apostle said, “Come here;” so I came and sat before him and <br/>
told him my story as I have told you, O b. 'Abbas. The apostle w T anted <br/>
his companions to hear my story.’ Then servitude occupied Salman so <br/>
that he could not be at Badr and Uhud w T ith the apostle. </p>
<p>Salman continued: 'Then the apostle said to me, “Write an agreement;” <br/>
so I wrote to my master agreeing to plant three hundred palm-trees for him, <br/>
digging out the base, and to pay forty okes of gold. The apostle called on <br/>
his companions to help me, which they did; one with thirty little palms, <br/>

<p>apostle told me to go and dig the holes for them, saying that when I had <br/>
14a done so he would put them in with his own hand. Helped by my com¬ <br/>
panions I dug the holes and came and told him; so we all went out together, <br/>
and as we brought him the palm shoots he planted them with his own hand; <br/>
and by God, not one of them died. Thus I had delivered the palm-trees, <br/>
but the money was still owing. Now the apostle had been given a piece of <br/>
gold as large as a hen’s egg from one of the mines 1 and he summoned me <br/>
and told me to take it and pay my debt with it. “How far will this relieve <br/>
me of my debt, O Apostle of God?” I said. “Take it,” he replied, “for <br/>
God will pay your debt with it.” So I took it and weighed it out to them, <br/>
and by God, it weighed forty okes, and so I paid my debt with it and Sal¬ <br/>
man was free. I took part with the Apostle in the battle of the Ditch as a <br/>
free man and thereafter I was at every other battle.’ </p>
<p>Yazid b. Abu Habib from a man of 'Abdu’I-Qays from Salman told me <br/>
that the latter said: ‘When I said, “How far will this relieve me of my <br/>
debt?” the apostle took it and turned it over upon his tongue, then he said, <br/>
“Take it and pay them in full”; so I paid them in full, forty okes.’ 2 </p>
<p>'A$im b. 'Umar b. Qatada on the authority of a trustworthy informant <br/>
from 'Umar b. 'Abdu’l-'^Aziz b. Marwan said that he was told that Salman <br/>
the Persian told the apostle that his master in 'Ammuriya told him to go to <br/>
a certain place in Syria where there was a man who lived between two <br/>
thickets. Every year as he used to go from one to the other, the sick used <br/>
to stand in his way and everyone he prayed for was healed. He said, ‘Ask <br/>
him about this religion which you seek, for he can tell you of it.’ So I went <br/>
on until I came to the place I had been told of, and I found that people <br/>
had gathered there with their sick until he came out to them that night <br/>
passing from one thicket to the other. The people came to him with their <br/>
sick and everyone he prayed for was healed. They prevented me from <br/>
getting to him so that I could not approach him until he entered the <br/>
143 thicket he was making for, but I took hold of his shoulder. He asked me <br/>
who I was as he turned to me and I said, ‘God have mercy on you, tell me <br/>
about the Haniflya, the religion of Abraham.’ He replied, ‘You are asking <br/>
about something men do not inquire of today; the tune has come near <br/>
when a prophet will be sent with this religion from the people of the <br/>
haram. Go to him, for he will bring you to it.’ Then he went into the <br/>
thicket. The apostle said to Salman, ‘If you have told me^the truth, you <br/>
met Jesus the son of Mary.’ </p>
<p>FOUR MEN WHO BROKE WITH POLYTHEISM </p>

circumambulate the idol to which they offered sacrifices, this being a feast </p>

<p>The Life of Muhammad 99 </p>
<p>which they held annually, four men drew apart secretly and agreed to keep <br/>
their counsel in the bonds of friendship. They were (i) Waraqa b. Naufal <br/>
b. Asad b. 'Abdu’l-'Uzza b. Qusayy b. Kilab b. Murra b. Ka'b b. Lu’ayy; </p>
<p>(ii) 'Ubaydullah b. Jahsh b. Ri’ab b. Ya'mar b. Sabra b. Murra b. Kablr <br/>
b. Ghanm b. Dudan b. Asad b. Khuzayma, whose mother was Umayma <br/>
d. 'Abdu’l-Muftalib; (iii) 'Uthman b. al-Huwayrith b. Asad b. 'Abdu’l- <br/>
'Uzza b. Qusayy; and (iv) Zayd b. 'Amr b. Nufayl b. 'Abdu’l-'Uzza b. <br/>
'Abdullah b. Qur$ b. Riyah 1 b. Razah b. *Adiyy b. Ka'b b. Lu’ayy. They <br/>
were of the opinion that their people had corrupted the religion of their <br/>
father Abraham, and that the stone they went round was of no account; it <br/>
could neither hear, nor see, nor hurt, nor help. ‘Find for yourselves a <br/>
religion,’ they said; ‘for by God you have none.’ So they went their <br/>
several ways in the lands, seeking the Haniflya, the religion of Abraham. </p>
<p>Waraqa attached himself to Christianity and studied its scriptures until <br/>
he had thoroughly mastered them. 'Ubaydullah went on searching until <br/>
Islam came; then he migrated with the Muslims to Abyssinia taking with 144 <br/>
him his wife who was a Muslim, Umm Habiba, d. Abu Sufyan. When he <br/>
arrived there he adopted Christianity, parted from Islam, and died a <br/>
Christian in Abyssinia. </p>
<p>Muhammad b. Ja'far b. al-Zubayr told me that when he had become a <br/>
Christian 'Ubaydullah as he passed the prophet’s companions who were there <br/>
used to say: ‘We see clearly, but your eyes are only half open,’ i.e. ‘We <br/>
see, but you are only trying to see and cannot see yet.* He used the word <br/>
sa’sa ’ because when a puppy tries to open its eyes to see, it only half sees. </p>
<p>The other word faqqaha means to open the eyes. After his death the <br/>
apostle married his widow Umm Habiba. Muhammad b. 'All b. Husayn <br/>
told me that the apostle sent 'Amr b. Umayya al-Pamrl to the Negus to ask <br/>
forh er and he married him to her. He gave her as a dowry, on the apostle’s <br/>
behalf, four hundred dinars. Muhammad b. 'All said, ‘We think that <br/>
'Abdu’l-Malik b. Marwan fixed the maximum dowry of women at four <br/>
hundred dinars because of this precedent.’ The man who handed her over <br/>
to the prophet was Khalid b. Sa'Id b. al-'As. </p>
<p>'Uthman b. al-Huwayrith went to the Byzantine emperor and became <br/>
a Christian. He was given high office there (142). </p>
<p>Zayd b. 'Amr stayed as he was; he accepted neither Judaism nor Chris¬ <br/>
tianity. He abandoned the religion of his people and abstained from idols, <br/>
animals that had died, blood, and things offered to idols. 2 He forbade the <br/>
killing of infant daughters, saying that he worshipped the God of Abraham, <br/>
and he publicly rebuked his people for their practices. </p>
<p>Hisham b. 'Urwa from his father on the authority of his mother Asma’ <br/>
d. Abu Bakr said that she saw Zayd as a very old man leaning his back on <br/>
the Ka'ba and saying, ‘0 Quraysh, By Him in whose hand is the soul of </p>

<p>I renounce al-Lat and al-'Uzza both of them <br/>
As any strong-minded person would. </p>
<p>I will not worship al-'Uzza and her two daughters, </p>
<p>Nor will I visit the two images of the Banu Amr. </p>
<p>I will not worship HubaU though he was our lord <br/>
In the days when I had little sense.. </p>
<p>I wondered (for in the night much is strange <br/>
Which in daylight is plain to the discerning). </p>
<p>That God had annihilated many men </p>
<p>Whose deeds were thoroughly evil </p>
<p>And spared others through the piety of a peop e </p>

<p>A man may languish for a time and then recover <br/>

<p>That the forgiving Lord may pardon my sin, </p>
<p>So keep to the fear of God your Lord; </p>

<p>Zayd b. 'Amr in reproaching his wife Safiya, d. al-Hadrami (144) <br/>
said: 2 </p>
<p>Now Zayd had determined to leave Mecca to travel about in search of 147 <br/>
the Hanifiya, the religion of Abraham, and whenever Safiya saw that he <br/>
had got ready to travel she told al-Khatfab b. Nufayl, who was his uncle <br/>
and his brother by the same mother . 3 He used to reproach him for <br/>
forsaking the religion of his people. He had instructed Safiya to tell him <br/>
if she saw him getting ready to depart; and then Zayd said: </p>
<p>Don’t keep me back in humiliation, </p>
<p>0 Safiya. It is not my way at all. </p>
<p>1 Or ‘I should add to my sins unless thou forgavest me’. </p>
<ul>
<li>What he said is reserved till the circumstances which gave rise to the poem have been <br/>
described. </li>
</ul>
<p>1 This was because his mother was first married to Nufayl and gave birth to aI-Kha?tab; <br/>
then she married her stepson 'Amr and gave birth to Zayd: thus the double relationship <br/>
came into being. </p>
<p>102 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>When I fear humiliation <br/>
I am a brave man whose steed is submissive. </p>
<p>A man who persistently frequents the gates of kings <br/>
Whose camel crosses the desert; </p>
<p>One who severs ties with others , </p>
<p>Whose difficulties can be overcome without (the aid of) inends. </p>
<p>A donkey only accepts humiliation <br/>
When its coat is worn out. </p>
<p>It says, ‘I will never give in <br/>
Because the load chafes my sides. 2 <br/>
My brother, (my mother’s son and then my uncle), </p>
<p>Uses words which do not please me. </p>
<p>When he reproaches me I say, </p>
<p>‘I have no answer for him.’ </p>
<p>Yet if I wished I could say things <br/>
Of which I hold the keys and door. </p>
<p>I was told by one of the family of Zayd b.'Amr b Nufayl that when <br/>
Zayd faced the Ka'ba inside the mosque he used to say, Labbayka in truth, <br/>
in worship and in service 3 </p>
<p>I take refuge in what Abraham took refuge <br/>
When he stood and faced the qibla’ </p>
<p>Then he said: </p>
<p>A humble prisoner, O God, my face in the dust, </p>
<p>Whatever thy commandment do I must. </p>
<p>148 Pride I seek not, but piety’s boon. </p>
<p>The traveller at midday is not as he who sleeps at noon (145). </p>
<p>And Zayd said: </p>
<p>I submit myself to him to whom </p>
<p>The earth which bears mighty rocks is subject. </p>
<p>He spread it out and when He saw it was settled <br/>
Upon the waters, He fixed the mountains on it. </p>
<p>I submit myself to Him to whom clouds which bear <br/>
Sweet water are subject. </p>
<p>When they are borne along to a land <br/>
They obediently pour copious rain upon it. </p>
<p>Now al-Khattab had ho harassed Zayd that he forced him to withdraw <br/>
to the upper part of Mecca, and he stopped in the mountain of Hira facing <br/>
the town Al-Kha t tab gave instructions to the young irresponsible men of <br/>
Quraysh that they should not let him enter Mecca and he was able to do so </p>
<p>1 So A.Dh. Perhaps mushayya means ‘quick to take leave . <br/>
a So A.Dh., but one would expect fildbuh to mean hts tough ones . </p>
<p>3 i.e. ‘Here I am as a sincere worshipper’. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 103 </p>
<p>in secret only. When they got to know of that they told al-Kha$tab and <br/>
drbve him out and harassed him because of their fear that he would show <br/>
their religion in its true colours and that some would join him in seceding <br/>
from it. He said, making much of its sanctity against those of his people <br/>
who treated it as ordinary: </p>
<p>O God, I am of the holy land, no outsider, </p>
<p>My house is in the centre of the place <br/>
Hard by al-Safa. </p>
<p>It is no home of error. 1 </p>
<p>Then he went forth seeking the religion of Abraham, questioning monks <br/>
and Rabbis until he had traversed al-Mausil and the whole of Mesopo¬ <br/>
tamia ; then he went through the whole of Syria until he came to a monk in <br/>
the high ground of Balqa. 2 This man, it is alleged, was well instructed in <br/>
Christianity. He asked him about the Hanlflya, the religion of Abraham, <br/>
and the monk replied, ‘You are seeking a religion to which no one today <br/>
can guide you, but the time of a prophet who will come forth from your 149 <br/>
own country which you have just left has drawn near. He will be sent with <br/>
the Hanlflya, the religion of Abraham, so stick to it, for he is about to be <br/>
sent now and this is his time.’ Now Zayd had sampled Judaism and Chris¬ <br/>
tianity and was not satisfied with either of them; so at these words he went <br/>
away at once making for Mecca; but when he was well inside the country <br/>
of Lakhm he was attacked and killed. </p>
<p>Waraqa b. Naufal b. Asad composed this elegy over him: </p>
<p>You were altogether on the right path Ibn 'Amr, </p>
<p>You have escaped hell’s burning oven <br/>
By serving the one and only God <br/>
And abandoning vain idols. </p>
<p>And by attaining the religion which you sought <br/>
Not being unmindful of the unity of your Lord <br/>
You have reached a noble dwelling <br/>
Wherein you will rejoice in ygur generous treatment. </p>
<p>You will meet there the friend of God, 3 <br/>
Since you were not a tyrant ripe for hell, </p>
<p>For the mercy of God reaches men, </p>
<p>Though they be seventy valleys deep below the earth (146). </p>
<p>THE WORD APPLIED TO THE APOSTLE OF GOD IN THE </p>
<p>GOSPEL </p>

Mary stated in the Gospel which he received from God for the followers <br/>
of the Gospel, in applying a term to describe the apostle of God, is the </p>

<p>following. It is extracted from what John the Apostle set down for them <br/>
when he wrote the Gospel for them from the Testament of Jesus Son of <br/>
Mary: ‘He that hateth me hath hated the Lord. And if I had not done in <br/>
their presence works which none other before me did, they had not.had sin: </p>
<p>150 but from now they are puffed up with pride and think that they will over¬ <br/>
come me and also the Lord. But the word that is in the law must be ful¬ <br/>
filled, “They hated me without a cause” (i.e. without reason). But when <br/>
the Comforter has come whom God will send to you from the Lord’s <br/>
presence, and the spirit of truth which will have gone forth from the Lord’s <br/>
presence he (shall bear) witness of me and ye also, because ye have been <br/>
with me from the beginning. I have spoken unto you about this that ye <br/>
should not be in doubt.’ 1 </p>
<p>The Munahhemana (God bless and preserve him!) in Syriac is Muham¬ <br/>
mad; in Greek he is the paraclete. </p>
<p>THE PROPHET’S MISSION </p>
<p>When Muhammad the apostle of God reached the age of forty God sent <br/>
him in compassion to mankind, ‘as an evangelist to all men’. 2 Now God <br/>
had made a covenant with every prophet Whom he had sent before him <br/>
that he should believe in him, testify to his truth and help him against his <br/>
adversaries, and he required of them that they should transmit that to <br/>
everyone who believed in them, and they carried out their obligations in <br/>
that respect. God said to Muhammad, ‘When God made a covenant with <br/>
the prophets (He said) this is the scripture and wisdom which I have given <br/>
you, afterwards an apostle will come confirming what you know that you <br/>
may believe in him and help him.’ He said, ‘Do you accept this and take up <br/>
my burden?’ i.e. the burden of my agreement which I have laid upon you. <br/>
They said, ‘We accept it.’ He answered, ‘Then bear witness and I am a <br/>
witness with you.’ 3 Thus God made a covenant with all the prophets that <br/>
they should testify to his truth and help him against his adversaries and </p>
<p>1 The passage quoted js John 15. 23 ff. It is interesting to note that the citation comes <br/>
from the Palestinian Syriac Lectionary and not from the ordinary Bible of the Syriac-speak¬ <br/>
ing Churches. The text is corrupt in one or two places; e.g. the phrase ‘puffed up with <br/>
pride and think that they will overcome me'. Bafiru is an obvious corruption of nayaru, <br/>
which agrees with the Syriac and underlying Greek. Wazannu seems to be another attempt <br/>
to make sense of the passage. The next word I am unable to explain. The most interesting <br/>
word is that rendered ‘Comforter’ which we find in the Palestinian Lectionary, but all other <br/>
Syriac versions render ‘paraclete’, following the Greek. This word was well established in <br/>
the Hebrew- and Aramaic-speaking world. The menahhemana in Syriac means the life- <br/>
giver and especially one who raises from the dead. Obviously such a meaning is out of place <br/>
here and what is meant is one who consoles and comforts people for the loss of one dear to <br/>
them. This is the meaning in the Talmud and Targum. It ought to be pointed out that by <br/>
the omission of the words ‘that is written’ before ‘in the law’ quite another meaning is given <br/>
to the prophecy. The natural rendering would be 'the word that concerns the Namus must <br/>
be fulfilled’. To Muslims the N&amp;mus was the angel Gabriel. Furthermore, the last words <br/>
are translated as the ordinary Arab reader would understand tashukku ; but in Syrian Arabic <br/>
it could bear the meaning of the Gospel text ‘stumble’. See further my article in Al-Anda- <br/>
lus, xv, fasc, 2 (1950), 289-96. 2 Sura 34. 27. 3 Sura 3. 75. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 105 </p>
<p>they transmitted that obligation to those who believed in them among the <br/>
two monotheistic religions. </p>
<p>(T. One whom I do not suspect told me from Sa'id b. Abu 'Aruba from T&gt; 1142 <br/>
Qatada b. Di'ama al-SadusI from Abu’l-Jald: ‘The Furqan came down on <br/>
the 14th night of Ramadan. Others say, No, but on the 17th; and in sup¬ <br/>
port of this they appeal to God’s word: ‘And what we sent down to our <br/>
servant on the day of al-Furqan, the day the two companies met’ 1 which <br/>
was the meeting of the apostle and the polytheists at Badr, and that took <br/>
place on the morning of Ramadan 17th.) </p>
<p>Al-Zuhrl related from 'Urwa b. Zubayr that 'A’isha told him that when 151 <br/>
Allah desired to honour Muhammad and have mercy on His servants by <br/>
means of him, the first sign of prophethood vouchsafed to the apostle was <br/>
true visions, resembling the brightness of daybreak, which were shown to <br/>
him in his sleep. And Allah, she said, made him love solitude so that he <br/>
liked nothing better than to be alone. </p>
<p>'Abdu’l-Malik b. 'Ubaydullah b. Abu Sufyan b. al-'Ala’ b. Jariya the <br/>
Thaqafite who had a retentive memory related to me from a certain scholar <br/>
that the apostle at the time when Allah willed to bestow His grace upon <br/>
him and endow him with prophethood would go forth for his affair and <br/>
journey far afield until he reached the glens of Mecca and the beds of its <br/>
valleys where no house was in sight; and not a stone or tree that he passed <br/>
by but would say, ‘Peace unto thee, O apostle of Allah.’ And the apostle <br/>
would turn to his right and left and look behind him and he would see. <br/>
naught but trees and stones. Thus he stayed seeing and hearing so long as <br/>
it pleased Allah that he should stay. Then Gabriel came to him with the <br/>
gift of God’s grace whilst he was on Hira’ in the month of Ramadan. </p>
<p>Wahb b. Kaisan a client of the family of al-Zubayr told me: I heard <br/>
'Abdullah b. al-Zubayr say to 'Ubayd b. 'Umayr b. Qatada the Laythite, </p>
<p>‘O 'Ubayd tell us how began the prophethood which was first bestowed <br/>
on the apostle when Gabriel came to him.’ And 'Ubayd in my presence <br/>
related to 'Abdullah and those with him as follows: The apostle would pray 152 <br/>
in seclusion on Hira’ every year for a month to practise tahannuth as was <br/>
the custom of Quraysh in heathen days. Tahannuth is religious devotion. </p>
<p>Abu Talib said: </p>
<p>By Thaur and him who made Thabir firm in its place </p>
<p>And by those going up to ascend Hira’ and coming down (147). 2 </p>
<p>Wahb b. Kaisan told me that 'Ubayd said to him: Every year during <br/>
that month the apostle would pray in seclusion and give food to the poor <br/>
that came to him. And when he completed the month and returned from <br/>
his seclusion, first of all before entering his house he would go to the Ka'ba <br/>
and walk round it seven times or as often as it pleased God; then he would <br/>
go back to his house until in the year when God sent him, in the month of </p>
<p>1 Sura 5. 42. </p>
<p>3 Thaur and Thabir are mountains near Mecca. The poem is given on p. 173; cf. Y&amp;q. <br/>
i. 938 . </p>
<p>106 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Ramadan in which God willed concerning him what He willed of His grace, <br/>
the apostle set forth to Hira’ as was his wont, and his family with him. <br/>
When it was the night on which God honoured him with his mission and <br/>
showed mercy on His servants thereby, Gabriel brought him the command <br/>
of God. ‘He came to me,’ said the apostle of God, ‘while I was asleep, with <br/>
a coverlet of brocade whereon was some writing, and said, “Read!” I said, <br/>
“What shall I read ?” He pressed me with it so tightly that I thought it <br/>
was death; then he let me go and said, “Read!” I said, “What shall I <br/>
read?” He pressed me with it again so that I thought it was death; then he <br/>
let me go and said “Read!” I said, “What shall I read?” He pressed me <br/>
with it the third time so that I thought it was death and said “Read!” I <br/>
153 said, “What then shall I read?”—and this I said only to deliver myself <br/>
from him, lest he should do the same to me again. He said: </p>
<p>“Read in the name of thy Lord who created, </p>
<p>Who created man of blood coagulated. </p>
<p>Read! Thy Lord is the most beneficent, </p>
<p>Who taught by the pen, </p>
<p>Taught that which they knew not unto men.” 1 </p>
<p>T. 1150 So I read it, and he departed from me. And I awoke from my sleep, and it <br/>
was as though these words were written on my heart. (T. Now none of <br/>
God’s creatures was more hateful to me than an (ecstatic) poet or a man <br/>
possessed: I could not even look at them. I thought, Woe is me poet or <br/>
possessed—Never shall Quraysh say this of me! I will go to the top of the <br/>
mountain and throw myself down that I may kill myself and gain rest. So <br/>
I went forth to do so and then) when I was midway on the mountain, I <br/>
heard a voice from heaven saying, “O Muhammad! thou art the apostle of <br/>
God and I am Gabriel.” I raised my head towards heaven to see (who was <br/>
speaking), and lo, Gabriel in the form of a man with feet astride the horizon, <br/>
saying, “O Muhammad! thou art the apostle of God and I am Gabriel.” </p>
<p>I stood gazing at him, (T. and that turned me from my purpose) moving <br/>
neither forward nor backward; then I began to turn my face aw r ay from <br/>
him, but towards whatever region of the sky I looked, I saw him as before. <br/>
And I continued standing there, neither advancing nor turning back, until <br/>
Khadija sent her messengers in search of me and they gained the high <br/>
ground above Mecca and returned to her while I.was standing in the same <br/>
place; then he parted from me and I from him, returning to my family. <br/>
And I came to Khadija and sat by her thigh and drew close to her. She <br/>
said, “O Abu’l-Qasim, 2 where hast thou been ? By God, I sent my messen¬ <br/>
gers in search of thee, and they reached the high ground above Mecca and <br/>
returned to me.” (T. I said to her, “Woe is me poet or possessed.” She <br/>
said, “I take refuge in God from that O Abu’l-Qasim. God would not treat <br/>
you thus since he knows your truthfulness, your great trustworthiness, <br/>
your fine character, and your kindness. This cannot be, my dear. Perhaps </p>
<p>1 Sura 96. 1-5. 2 The kunya or ‘name of honour’ of Muhammad. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 107 </p>
<p>you did see something.” “Yes, I did,” I said.) Then I told her of what I <br/>
had seen; and she said, “Rejoice, O son of my uncle, and be of good heart. <br/>
Verily, by Him in whose hand is Khadija’s soul, I have hope that thou wilt <br/>
be the prophet of this people.” * Then she rose and gathered her garments <br/>
about her and set forth to her cousin Waraqa b. Naufal b. Asad b. ‘Abdu’l- <br/>
Uzza b. Qusayy, who had become a Christian and read the scriptures and <br/>
learned from those that follow the Torah and the Gospel. And when she <br/>
related to him what the apostle of God told her he had seen and heard, <br/>
Waraqa cried, ‘Holy! Holy! Verily by Him in whose hand is Waraqa’s <br/>
soul, if thou hast spoken to me the truth, O Khadija, there hath come unto <br/>
him the greatest Namus (T. meaning Gabriel) who came to Moses afore¬ <br/>
time, and lo, he is the prophet of this people. Bid him be of good heart.’ </p>
<p>So Khadija returned to the apostle of God and told him what Waraqa had <br/>
said. (T. and that calmed his fears somewhat.) And when the apostle of <br/>
God had finished his period of seclusion and returned (to Mecca), in the <br/>
first place he performed the circumambulation of the Ka'ba, as was his <br/>
wont. While he was doing it, Waraqa met him and said, ‘O son of my 154 <br/>
brother, tell me what thou hast seen and heard.’ The apostle told him, and <br/>
Waraqa said, Surely, by Him in whose hand is Waraqa’s soul, thou art the <br/>
prophet of this people. There hath come unto thee the greatest Namus, <br/>
who came unto Moses. Thou wilt be called a liar, and they will use thee <br/>
despitefullyand cast thee out and fight against thee. Verily, if I live to see that <br/>
day, I will help God in such wise as He knoweth.’ Then he brought his head <br/>
near to him and kissed his forehead; and the apostle went to his own house. </p>
<p>(T. Waraqa’s words added to his confidence and lightened his anxiety.) </p>
<p>Isma'il b. Abu Hakim, a freedman of the family of al-Zubayr, told me on <br/>
Khadija’s authority that she said to the apostle of God, ‘O son of my <br/>
uncle, are you able to tell me about your visitant, when he comes to you ?’ </p>
<p>He replied that he could, and she asked him to tell her when he came. So <br/>
when Gabriel came to him, as he was wont, the apostle said to Khadija, </p>
<p>‘This is Gabriel who has just come to me.’ ‘Get up, O son of my uncle,’ <br/>
she said, and sit by my left thigh’. The apostle did so, and she said, ‘Can <br/>
you see him? Yes, he said. She said, ‘Then turn round and sit on my <br/>
right thigh.’ He did so, and she said, ‘Can you see him?’ When he said <br/>
that he could she asked him to move and sit in her lap. When he had done <br/>
this she again asked if he could see him, and when he said yes, she dis¬ <br/>
closed her form and cast aside her veil while the apostle was sitting in her <br/>
lap. Then she said, ‘Can you see him?’ And he replied, ‘No.’ She said, </p>
<p>‘O son of my uncle, rejoice and be of good heart, by God he is an angel and <br/>
not a satan.’ </p>
<p>I told Abdullah b. Hasan this story and he said, ‘I heard my mother <br/>
Fatima, daughter of Husayn, talking about this tradition from Khadija, <br/>
but as I heard it she made the apostle of God come inside her shift, and <br/>
thereupon Gabriel departed, and she said to the apostle of God, “This <br/>
verily is an angel and not a satan.”’ </p>
<p>PART II </p>
<p>Muhammad’s call and </p>
<p>PREACHING IN MECCA </p>
<p>THE BEGINNING OF THE SENDING DOWN OF THE 155 </p>
<p>QURAN </p>
<p>The apostle began to receive revelations in the month of Ramadan. In the <br/>
words of God, ‘The month of Ramadan in which the Quran was brought <br/>
down as a guidance to men, and proofs of guidance and a decisive criterion.’ 1 <br/>
And again, ‘Verily we have sent it down on the night of destiny, and what <br/>
has shown you what the night of destiny is ? The night of destiny is better <br/>
than a thousand months. In it the angels and the spirit descend by their <br/>
Lord’s permission with every matter. It is peace until the rise of dawn.’ 2 <br/>
Again, ‘H.M. by the perspicuous book, verily we have sent it down in a <br/>
blessed night. Verily, we were warning. In it every wise matter is decided <br/>
as a command from us. Verily we sent it down.’ 3 And again, ‘Had you <br/>
believed in God and what we sent down to Our servant on the day of <br/>
decision, the day on which the two parties met’, 4 i.e. the meeting of the <br/>
apostle with the polytheists in Badr. Abu Ja'far Muhammad b. ‘All b. <br/>
al-Husayn told me that the apostle of God met the polytheists in Badr on <br/>
the morning of Friday, the 17th of Ramadan. </p>
<p>Then revelation came fully to the apostle while he was believing in Him <br/>
and in the truth of His message. He received it .willingly, and took upon <br/>
himself what it entailed whether of man’s goodwill or anger. Prophecy is <br/>
a troublesome burden—only strong, resolute messengers can bear it by <br/>
God’s help and grace, because of the opposition which they meet from <br/>
men in conveying God’s message. The apostle carried out God’s orders in <br/>
spite of the opposition and ill treatment which he met with. </p>
<p>KHADIJA, DAUGHTER OF KHUWAYLID, ACCEPTS ISLAM </p>
<p>Khadija believed in him and accepted as true what he brought from God, <br/>
and helped him in his work. She was the first to believe in God and His <br/>
apostle, and in the truth of his message. By her God lightened the burden <br/>
of His prophet. He never met with contradiction and charges of falsehood, <br/>
which saddened him, but God comforted him by her when he went home. </p>
<p>She strengthened him, lightened his burden, proclaimed his truth, and <br/>
belittled men’s opposition. May God Almighty have mercy upon her! 156 <br/>
Hisham b. 'Urwa told me on the authority of his father 'Urwa b. al- <br/>
Zubayr from 'Abdullah b. Ja'far b. Abu Talib that the apostle said, ‘I was <br/>
commanded to give Khadija the good news of a house of qa$ab wherein <br/>
would be no clamour and no toil’ (148). </p>
<p>Then revelations stopped for a time so that the apostle of God was dis¬ <br/>
tressed and grieved. Then Gabriel brought him the Sura of the Morning, <br/>
in which his Lord, who had so honoured him, swore that He had not for- </p>
<p>1 Sura 2. 181. 3 Sura 97. </p>
<p>3 Sura 44. 1-4. 4 Sura 8. 42. </p>
<p>112 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>saken him, and did not hate him. God said, ‘By the morning and the night <br/>
when it is still, thy Lord hath not forsaken nor hated thee,’ 1 meaning that <br/>
He has not left you and forsaken you, nor hated you after having loved <br/>
you. ‘And verily, the latter end is better for you than the beginning,’ 2 i.e. <br/>
What I have for you when you return to Me is better than the honour <br/>
which I have given you in the world. ‘And your Lord will give you and <br/>
will satisfy you,’ i.e. of victory in this world and reward in the next. ‘Did <br/>
he not find you an orphan and give you refuge, going astray and guided <br/>
you, found you poof and made you rich ?’ God thus told him of how He <br/>
had begun to honour him in his earthly life, and of His kindness to him as <br/>
an orphan poor and wandering astray, and of His delivering him from all <br/>
that by His compassion (149). </p>
<p>X S 7 ‘Do not oppress the orphan and do not repel the beggar.’ That is, do not <br/>
be a tyrant or proud or harsh or mean towards the weakest of God’s <br/>
creatures. </p>
<p>‘Speak of the kindness of thy Lord,’ i.e. tell about the kindness of God <br/>
in giving you prophecy, mention it and call men to it. </p>
<p>So the apostle began to mention secretly God’s kindness to him and to <br/>
his servants in the matter of prophecy to everyone among his people whom <br/>
he could trust. </p>
<p>THE PRESCRIPTION OF PRAYER </p>
<p>The apostle was ordered to pray and so he prayed. Salih b. Kaisan from <br/>
'Urwa b. al-Zubayr from *A’isha told me that she said, ‘When prayer was <br/>
first laid on the apostle it was with two prostrations for every prayer: then <br/>
God raised it to four prostrations at home while on a journey the former <br/>
ordinance of two prostrations held.’ </p>
<p>158 A learned person told me that when prayer was laid on the apostle <br/>
Gabriel came to him while he was on the heights of Mecca and dug a hole <br/>
for him with his heel in the side of the valley from which a fountain gushed <br/>
forth, and Gabriel performed the ritual ablution as the apostle watched <br/>
him. This was in order to show him how to purify himself before prayer. <br/>
Then the apostle performed the ritual ablution as he had seen Gabriel do <br/>
it. Then Gabriel said a prayer with him while the apostle prayed with his <br/>
prayer. Then Gabriel left him. The apostle came to Khadlja and per¬ <br/>
formed the ritual for her as Gabriel had done for him, and she copied him. <br/>
Then he prayed with her as Gabriel had prayed with him, and she prayed <br/>
his prayer. </p>
<p>*Utba b. Muslim freedman of B. Taym from Nafi' b. Jubayr b, Muj'im <br/>
(who was prolific in relating tradition) from I. 'Abbas told me: ‘When <br/>
prayer was laid upon the apostle Gabriel came to him and prayed the noon <br/>
prayer when the sun declined. Then he prayed the evening prayer when </p>
<p>1 Sura 93. </p>
<p>2 Sura 93. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 1x3 </p>
<p>his shadow equalled his own length. Then he prayed the sunset prayer <br/>
When the sun set. Then he prayed the last night prayer when the twilight <br/>
had disappeared. Then he prayed with him the morning prayer when the <br/>
dawn rose. Then he came to him and prayed the noon prayer on the <br/>
morrow when his shadow equalled his height. Then he prayed the evening <br/>
prayer when his shadow equalled the height of both of them. Then he <br/>
prayed the sunset prayer when the sun set at the time it had the day <br/>
before. Then he prayed with him the last night prayer when the first third <br/>
ot the night had passed. Then he prayed the dawn prayer when it was clear <br/>
but the sun was not shining. Then he said, “O Muhammad, prayer is i n <br/>
what is between your prayer today and your prayer yesterday.”’ 1 (T. T. 1161 <br/>
Yunus b. Bukayr said that Muhammad b. Ishaq told him that Yahya b.' <br/>
,. b “: Ash ath al ' Klndi of the people of Kufa said that Isma'Il b. Iyas b <br/>
Afif from his father from his grandfather said, ‘When I was a merchant <br/>
I came to al- Abbas during the days of pilgrimage; and while we were <br/>
together a man came out to pray and stood facing the Ka'ba; then a <br/>
woman came out and stood praying with him; then a young man came out <br/>
and stood praying with him. I said to 'Abbas, “What is their religion ? It <br/>
is some thing new to me.” He said, “This is Muhammad b. Abdullah who <br/>
alleges that God has sent him with it and that the treasures of Chosrhoes <br/>
and Caesar will be opened to him. The woman is his wife Khadlja who <br/>
believes m him, and this young man is his nephew 'All who believes in him.” <br/>
said&gt; W° uld tbat 1 could have believed that day and been a third!” ’ 2 <br/>

<p>*alI b. abO tAlib the first male TO ACCEPT ISLAM </p>
<p>'All was the first male to believe in the apostle of God, to pray with him </p>
<p>159 and to believe in his divine message, when he was a boy of ten. God <br/>
favoured him in that he was brought up in the care of the apostle before <br/>
Islam began. </p>
<p>‘Abdullah b. Abu Najlh on the authority of Mujahid b. Jabr Abu’l- <br/>
Hajjaj told me that God showed His favour and goodwill towards him <br/>
when a grievous famine overtook Quraysh. Now Abu Talib had a large <br/>
family, and the prophet approached his uncle, A 1 -'Abbas, who was one of <br/>
the richest of B. Hashim, suggesting that in view of his large family and the <br/>
famine which affected everyone, they should go together and offer to relieve <br/>
him of the burden of some of his family. AI-'Abbas agreed, and so they <br/>
went to Abu Talib offering to relieve him from his responsibility of two <br/>
boys until conditions improved. Abu Talib said, Do what you like so <br/>
long as you leave me ‘Aqil’ (15°)* So the a P os tl e took All and kept him <br/>
with him and Al-‘Abbas took Ja'far. ‘All continued to be with the apostle <br/>
until God sent him forth as a prophet. ‘All followed him, believed him, <br/>
and declared his truth, while Ja'far remained with A 1 -'Abbas until he <br/>
became a Mpslim and was independent of him. </p>
<p>A traditionist mentioned that when the time of prayer came the apostle <br/>
used to go out to the glens of Mecca accompanied by 'All, who went un¬ <br/>
beknown to his father, and his uncles and the rest of his people. There <br/>
they used to pray the ritual prayers, and return at nightfall. This went on <br/>
as long as God intended that it should, until one day Abu Talib came upon <br/>
them while they were praying, and said to the apostle, ‘O nephew, what is <br/>
this religion which I see you practising?’ He replied, ‘O uncle, this is the <br/>
religion of God, His angels, His apostles, and the religion of our father </p>
<p>160 Abraham.’ Or, as he said, ‘God has sent me as an apostle to mankind, and <br/>
you, my uncle, most deserve that I should teach you the truth and call you <br/>
to guidance, and you are the most worthy to respond and help me,’ or <br/>
words to that effect. His uncle replied, ‘I cannot give up the religion of <br/>
my fathers which, they followed, but by God you shall never meet with <br/>
anything to distress you so long as I live.’ They mention that he said to <br/>
‘All, *My boy, what is this religion of yours?’ He answered, ‘I believe in <br/>
God and in the apostle of God, and I declare that what he has brought is <br/>
true, and I pray to God with him and follow him.’ They allege that he <br/>
said, ‘He would not call you to anything but what is good so stick to him.’ </p>
<p>Zayd the fftedman of the apostle was the first male to accept Islam after </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 115 </p>
<p>‘All (151). Then Abu Bakr b. Abu Quhafa whose name was ‘Atiq became <br/>
a Muslim, His father’s name was 'Uthman b. 'Amir b, 'Amr b. Ka'b b. <br/>
Sa'd b. Taym b. Murra b. Ka'b b. Lu’ayy b. Ghalib b. Fihr. When he <br/>
became a Muslim, he showed his faith openly and called others to God and <br/>
his apostle. He was a man whose society was desired, well liked and of <br/>
easy manners. He knew more about the genealogy of Quraysh than anyone <br/>
else and of their faults and merits. He was a merchant of high character <br/>
and kindliness. His people used to come to him to discuss many matters <br/>
with him because of his wide knowledge, his experience in commerce, and <br/>
his sociable nature. He began to call to God and to Islam all whom he <br/>
trusted of those who came to him and sat with him (152). </p>
<p>[I.K. iii, 24. The following day 'All b. Abu Talib came as the two of <br/>
them were praying and asked, ‘What is this, Muhammad?’ He replied, ‘It <br/>
is God’s religion which He has chosen for Himself and sent His apostles <br/>
with it. I call you to God, the One without an associate, to worship Him <br/>
and to disavow al-Lat and al-'Uzza.’ 'All said, ‘This is something that I <br/>
have never heard of before today. I cannot decide a matter until I have <br/>
talked about it with Abu Talib.’ Now the apostle did not want his secret <br/>
to be divulged before he applied himself to the publication of his message, <br/>
so he said, ‘If you do not accept Islam, then conceal the matter.’ 'All <br/>
tarried that night until God put Islam into his heart. Early next morning <br/>
he went to the apostle and asked him what his orders w r ere. He said, ‘Bear <br/>
witness that there is no god but Allah alone without associate, and disavow' <br/>
al-Lat and al-'Uzza, and renounce rivals.’ ‘All did so and became a Mus¬ <br/>
lim. He refrained from coming to him out of fear of Abu Talib and con¬ <br/>
cealed his Islam and did not let it be seen. </p>
<p>Zayd b. Haritha became a Muslim and the tw f o of them tarried nearly a <br/>
month. (Then) 'All kept coming to the apostle. It w r as a special favour to <br/>
‘AH from God that he was in the closest association with the apostle before <br/>
Islam.] </p>
<p>THE COMPANIONS WHO ACCEPTED ISLAM AT THE <br/>
INVITATION OF ABU BAKR </p>
<p>Those who accepted Islam at his invitation according to what I heard <br/>

<p>He brought them to the apostle when they had accepted his invitation <br/>
and they accepted Islam and prayed. <em>1 have heard that the apostle of God <br/>

signs of reluctance, suspicion, and hesitation, except Abu Bakr. When I <br/>

<p>THE APOSTLE’S PUBLIC PREACHING AND THE RESPONSE 166 </p>
<p>People began to accept Islam, both men and women, in large numbers <br/>
until the fame of it was spread throughout Mecca, and it began to be talked <br/>
about. Then God commanded His apostle to declare the truth of what he <br/>
had received and to make known His commands to men and to call them <br/>
to Him. Three years elapsed from the time that the apostle concealed his <br/>
state until God commanded him to publish his religion, according to <br/>
information which has reached me. Then God said, 'Proclaim what you <br/>
have been ordered and turn aside from the polytheists.’ 1 And again, ‘Warn <br/>
% family, thy nearest relations, and lower thy wing to the followers who <br/>
follow thee.’ 2 And ‘Sav, I am the one who warns plainly* (164). 3 </p>
<p>(T. Ibn Hamid from Salama from Ibn Ishaq from 'Abdullah b. al- T- 1171 <br/>
Ghaffar b. al-Qasim from al-Minhal b. 'Amr from 'Abdullah b. al-Harith <br/>
b. Naufal b. al-Harith b. 'Abdu’I-Muttalib from 'Abdullah b. 'Abbas from <br/>
'All b. Abu Talib said: When these words ‘Warn thy family, thy nearest <br/>
relations’ came down to the apostle he called me and said, ‘God has <br/>
ordered me to warn my family, my nearest relations and the task is beyond <br/>
my strength. I know that when I made this message known to them I <br/>
should meet with great unpleasantness so I kept silence until Gabriel came <br/>
to me and told me that if I did not do as I was ordered my Lord would punish <br/>
me. So get some food ready with a leg of mutton and fill a cup with milk and <br/>
then get together the sons of 'Abdu’I-Muttalib so that I can address them <br/>
and tell them what I have been ordered to say.’ I did what he ordered and <br/>
summoned them. There were at that time forty men more or less including <br/>
his uncles Abu Talib, Hamza, al- Abbas, and Abu Lahab. When they were <br/>
assembled he told me to bring in the food which I had prepared for them, <br/>
and when I produced it the apostle took a bit of the meat and split it in <br/>
his teeth and threw it into the dish. Then he said, ‘Take it in the name of <br/>
God.’ The men ate till they could eat no more, and all I could see (in the <br/>
dish) was the place where their hands had been. And as sure as I live if <br/>
there had been only one man he could have eaten what I put before the <br/>
lot of them. Then he said, ‘Give the people to drink’, so I brought them </p>

<p>3 Sura 15. 8, 9. </p>
<p>118 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>the'cup and they drank until they were all satisfied, and as sure as I live if <br/>
there had been, only one man he could have drunk that amount. When the <br/>
apostle wanted to address them Abu Lahab got in first and said, ‘Your <br/>
host has bewitched you’; so they dispersed before the apostle could <br/>
address them. On the morrow he said to me, ‘This man spoke before I <br/>
could, and the people dispersed before I could address them, so do exactly <br/>
as you did yesterday.' Everything went as before and then the apostle said, <br/>
‘O Sons of 'Abdu’l-Muttalib, I know of no Arab who has come to his <br/>
people with a nobler message than mine. I have brought you the best of <br/>
this world and the next. God has ordered me to call you to Him. So <br/>
which of you will co-operate with me in this matter, my brother, my <br/>
executor, and my successor being among you?’ The men remained silent <br/>
and I, though the youngest, most rheumy-eyed, fattest in body and thinnest <br/>
in legs, said: ‘0 prophet of God, I will be your helper in this matter.’ He <br/>
laid his hand on the back of my neck and said, ‘This is my brother, my <br/>
executor, and my successor among you. Hearken to him and obey him.’ <br/>
The men got up laughing and saying to Abu Talib, ‘He has ordered you to <br/>
listen to your son and obey him!’) </p>
<p>(T- 1173. Ibn Hamid from Salama from Ibn Ishaq from 'Amrb. 'Ubayd <br/>
from al-Hasan b. Abu’l-Hasan said: When this verse came down to the <br/>
apostle, he stood in the vale and said, ‘O Sons of 'Abdu’l-Muttalib; O Sons <br/>
of 'Abdu Manaf; O Sons of Qusayy.’—Then he named Quraysh tribe by <br/>
tribe until he came to the end of them—‘I call you to God and I w'arn you <br/>
of his punishment.’) </p>
<p>When the apostle’s companions prayed they went to the glens so that <br/>
their people could not see them praying, and while Sa'd b. Abu Waqqas <br/>
was with a number of the prophet’s companions in one of the glens of <br/>
Mecca, a band of polytheists came upon them while they were praying and <br/>
rudely interrupted them. They blamed them for what they were doing <br/>
until they came to blows, and it was on that occasion that Sa'd smote a <br/>
polytheist w'ith the jawbone of a camel and w r oundcd him. This was the <br/>
first blood to be shed in Islam. </p>
<p>When the apostle openly displayed Islam as God ordered him his people <br/>
did not withdraw or turn against him, so far as I have heard, until he spoke <br/>
67 disparagingly of their gods. When he did that they took great offence and <br/>
resolved unanimously to treat him as an enemy, except those whom God <br/>
had protected by Islam from such evil, but they were a despised minority, <br/>
Abu Talib his uncle treated the apostle kindly and protected him, the <br/>
latter continuing to obey God’s commands, nothing turning him back. <br/>
When Quraysh saw that he would not yield to them and withdrew from <br/>
them and insulted their gods and that his uncle treated him kindly and <br/>
stood up in his defence and would not give him up to them, some of their <br/>
leading men went to Abu Talib, namely 'Utba and Shayba, both sons of <br/>
Rabl'a b. 'Abdu Shams . . . and Abu Sufyan (165) b. Harb . . . and Abu’l-- <br/>
Bakhtari whose name was al-'As b. Ilisham b. al-Harith b. Asad . . . and </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 119 </p>
<p>al-Aswad b, al-Muttalib b. Asad . . . and Abu Jahl (whose name was <br/>
'Amr, his title being Abu’i-Hakam) b. Hisham b. al Mughlra . . . and <br/>
al-Walid b. al-Mughlra , . . and Nubayh and Munabbih two sons of <br/>
al-Hajjaj b. 'Amir b. Hudhayfa ... and al-'As b. Wa’il (166). They said, </p>
<p>‘O Abu Talib, your nephew has cursed our gods, insulted our religion, <br/>
mocked our way of life 1 and accused our forefathers of error; either you <br/>
must stop him or you must let us get at him, for you yourself are in the 168 <br/>
same position as we are in opposition to him and we will rid you of him.’ </p>
<p>He gave them a conciliatory reply and a soft answer and they went away. </p>
<p>The apostle continued on his way, publishing God’s religion and calling <br/>
men thereto. In consequence his relations with Quraysh deteriorated and <br/>
men withdrew from him in enmity. They were always talking about him <br/>
and inciting one another against him. Then they went to Abu Talib a <br/>
second time and said, \ou have a high and lofty position among us, and <br/>
we have asked you to put a stop to your nephew’s activities but you have <br/>
not done so. By God, we cannot endure that our fathers should be reviled, <br/>
our customs mocked and our gods insulted. Until you rid us of him we <br/>
will fight the pair of you until one side perishes,’ or w'ords to that effect. </p>
<p>Thus saying, they went off. Abu Talib was deeply distressed at the <br/>
breach with his people and their enmity but he could not desert the apostle <br/>
and give him up to them. </p>
<p>Ya'qub b. 'Utba b. al-Mughira b. al-Akhnas told me that he was told <br/>
that after hearing these words from the Quraysh Abu Talib sent for his <br/>
nephew and told him what his people had said. ‘Spare me and yourself,’ <br/>
he said. ‘Do not put on me a burden greater than I can bear.’ The apostle <br/>
thought that his uncle had the idea of abandoning and betraying him, and <br/>
that he was going to lose his help and support. He answered, ‘O my uncle, <br/>
by God, if they put the sun in my right hand and the moon in my left on <br/>
condition that I abandoned this course, until God has made it victorious, <br/>
or I perish therein, I would not abandon it.’ Then the apostle broke into <br/>
tears, and got up. As he turned away his uncle called him and said, ‘Come <br/>
back, my nephew,’ and when he came back, he said, ‘Go and say what you <br/>
please, for by God I will never give you up on any account.’ </p>
<p>When the Quraysh perceived that Abu Talib had refused to give up the <br/>
apostle, and that he was resolved to part company with them, they went to 169 <br/>
him with Umara b. al-Walid b, al-Mughlra and said, according to my <br/>
information, ‘O Abu Talib, this is 'Umara, the strongest and most hand¬ <br/>
some young man among Quraysh, so take him and you will have the benefit <br/>
of his intelligence and support; adopt him as a son and give up to us this <br/>
nephew' of yours, who has opposed your religion and the religion of your <br/>
fathers, severed the unity of your people, and mocked our w r ay of life, so <br/>
that we may kill him. This will be man for man.’ He answered, ‘By God, <br/>
this is an evil thing that you w r ould put upon me, w r ould you give me your </p>
<p>. 1 a blam means the civilization and virtues of the pre-Islamic Arabs. See the excellent <br/>
discussion of jahl and hilm in Goldziher’s Muhammedanische Studien , i. 220 f. </p>
<p>120 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>son that I should feed him for you, and should I give you my son that you <br/>
should kill him? By God, this shall never be.’ Al-Mut'im b. 'Adiy said, <br/>
‘Your people have treated you fairly and have taken pains to avoid what <br/>
you dislike. I do not think that you are willing to accept anything from <br/>
them.’ Abu Talib replied, ‘They have not treated me fairly, by God, but <br/>
you have agreed to betray me and help the people against me, so do what <br/>
you like,’ or words to that effect. So the situation worsened, the quarrel <br/>
became heated and people were sharply divided, and openly showed their <br/>
animosity to their opponents. Abu Talib wrote the following verses, <br/>
indirectly attacking Mut'im, and including those who had abandoned him <br/>
from the 'Abdu Manaf, and his enemies among the tribes of Quraysh. He <br/>
mentions therein what they had asked of him and his estrangement from <br/>
them. </p>
<p>Say to 'Amr and al-Walld and Mut'im </p>
<p>Rather than your protection give me a young camel, </p>
<p>Weak, grumbling and murmuring, </p>
<p>Sprinkling its flanks with its urine <br/>
Lagging behind the herd, and not keeping up. </p>
<p>When it goes up the desert ridges, you would call it a weasel. </p>
<p>I see our two brothers, sons of our mother and father, </p>
<p>When they are asked for help, say ‘It is not our business.’ </p>
<p>Nay, it is their affair, but they have fallen away, </p>
<p>As a rock falls from the top of Dhu 'Alaq. 1 <br/>
I mean especially 'Abdu Shams and Naufal, </p>
<p>W’ho have flung us aside like a burning coal. </p>
<p>They have slandered their brothers among the people; </p>
<p>Their hands are emptied of them. </p>
<p>They shared their fame with men of low birth, </p>
<p>With men whose fathers were whispered about; </p>
<p>170 And Taym, and Makhzum, and Zuhra, are of them </p>
<p>Who-Ijad been friends of ours when help was sought; </p>
<p>By God, there will always be enmity between us <br/>
As long as one of our descendants lives. </p>
<p>Their minds and thoughts were foolish, </p>
<p>They were entirely without judgement (167). 2 </p>
<p>Then the Quraysh incited people against the companions of the apostle <br/>
who had become Muslims. Every tribe fell upon the Muslims among them, <br/>
beating them and seducing them from their religion. God protected His <br/>
apostle from them through his uncle, who, when he saw what Quraysh <br/>
were doing, called upon B. Hashim and B. al-Muttalib to stand with him in <br/>
protecting the apostle. This they agreed to do, with the exception of Abu <br/>
Lahab, the accursed enemy of God. </p>
<p>1 A mountain in the Banu Asad country. </p>
<p>3 To say that a man’s well is demolished is to accuse him of losing all common sense. </p>
<p>121 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Abu Talib was delighted at the response of his tribe and their kindness, <br/>
and began to praise them and to bring to men’s memory their past. He <br/>
mentioned the superiority of the apostle among them and his position so <br/>
that he might strengthen their resolve and that they might extend their <br/>
kindness to him. He said: </p>
<p>If one day Quraysh gathered together to boast, </p>
<p>'Abdu Manaf would be their heart and soul; </p>
<p>And if the nobles of 'Abdu Manaf were reckoned, </p>
<p>Amongst Hashim would be their noblest and chief; </p>
<p>If they boast one day, then Muhammad <br/>
Would be the chosen noble and honourable one. </p>
<p>Quraysh summoned everyone against us; </p>
<p>They were not successful and they were beside themselves. </p>
<p>Of old we have never tolerated injustice; </p>
<p>When people turned away their faces in pride we made them face us. <br/>
We protected their sanctuary whenever danger threatened <br/>
And drove the assailant from its buildings. </p>
<p>Through us the dry wood becomes green, </p>
<p>Under our protection its roots expand and grow. </p>
<p>AL-WALID B. AL-MUGH IRA 17 * </p>
<p>When the fair 1 was due, a number of the Quraysh came to al-Walid b. al- <br/>
Mughlra, who was a man of some standing, and he addressed them in <br/>
these words: ‘The time of the fair has come round again and representa¬ <br/>
tives of the Arabs will come to you and they will have heard about this <br/>
fellow of yours, so agree upon one opinion without dispute so that none <br/>
will give the lie to the other.’ They replied, ‘You give us your opinion <br/>
about him.’ He said, ‘No, you speak and I will listen.’ They said, ‘He is <br/>
a kdhin .’ He said, ‘By God, he is not that, for he has not the unintelligent <br/>
murmuring and rhymed speech of the kahin .’ ‘Then he is possessed,’ they <br/>
said. ‘No, he is not that,’ he said, ‘we have seen possessed ones, and here <br/>
is no choking, spasmodic movements and whispering.’ ‘Then he is a poet,’ <br/>
they said. ‘No, he is no poet, for we know poetry in all its forms and <br/>
metres.’ ‘Then he is a sorcerer.’ ‘No, we have seen sorcerers and their <br/>
sorcery, and here is no spitting and no knots.’ 1 ‘Then what are we to say, </p>
<p>0 Abu 'Abdu Shams?’ they asked. He replied, ‘By God, his speech is <br/>
sweet, his root is a palm-tree whose branches are fruitful (168), and every¬ <br/>
thing you have said would be known to be false. The nearest thing to the <br/>
truth is your saying that he is a sorcerer, w r ho has brought a message by <br/>
which he separates a man from his father, or from his brother, or from his <br/>
wife, or from his family,’ </p>
<p>1 Cf. Sura 113. 4. Spitting, or perhaps ‘blowing.’ </p>
<p>122 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>At this point they left him, and began to sit on the paths which men take <br/>
when they come to the fair. They warned everyone who passed them <br/>
about Muhammad’s doings. God revealed concerning al-Walld: </p>
<p>Leave to Me him I made, </p>
<p>Giving him wealth and trade, </p>
<p>While sons before him played, </p>
<p>The road for him I laid, </p>
<p>Then he coveted more of My aid, </p>
<p>Ay, Our signs hath he gainsaid (169). 1 </p>
<p>172 ‘I shall impose on him a grievous burden; he thought and planned; may <br/>
he perish how he planned, may he perish how he planned. Then he looked, <br/>
then he frowned, and showed anger’ (170). </p>
<p>‘Then he turned his back in pride and said, “This is nothing but ancient <br/>
sorcery, this is nothing but the speech of a mortal’’.’ </p>
<p>Then God revealed concerning the men who were with him, composing <br/>
a term to describe the apostle and the revelation he brought from God, ‘As <br/>
we sent down upon the dividers who had split the Quran into parts, by thy <br/>
Lord we will ask them all about what they used to do’ (171). 2 </p>
<p>So these men began to spread this report about the apostle with every¬ <br/>
one they met so that the Arabs went away from that fair knowing about <br/>
the apostle, and he was talked about in the whole of Arabia. W T hen Abu <br/>
Talib feared that the multitude would overwhelm him with his family he <br/>
composed the following ode, in which he claimed protection in the sanc¬ <br/>
tuary of Mecca and by his position therein. He showed his affection for <br/>
the nobles of his people while, nevertheless, he told them and others in his <br/>
poetry that he was not going to give up the apostle or surrender him on any <br/>
account whatever, but he would die in his defence. </p>
<p>When I saw the people had no love for us <br/>
And had severed every tie and relationship, </p>
<p>173 And shown us enmity and ill-will, </p>
<p>Obeying the orders of persecuting enemies, </p>
<p>And had allied themselves with treacherous people against us, </p>
<p>Biting their fingers in rage at our backs, </p>
<p>I stood firm against them with my pliant spear, </p>
<p>And my shining sword, heirloom of princes. </p>
<p>Round the temple I gathered my clan and my brothers, </p>
<p>And laid hold of the striped red cloth 3 that covered it, </p>
<p>Standing together, facing its gates, </p>
<p>Where everyone who takes an oath completes his vow, </p>
<p>1 Sura 74. 11-25. It is strange that after al-Walid has made the point that Muhammad </p>
<p>cannot be a kdhin because he does not deliver messages in saj‘ the next quotation from the <br/>
Quran should be an example (to which I fear I have not done justice) of that very form. </p>
<p>3 Sura 15. 90. </p>
<p>1 This is the meaning which A. Dh. gives to veafail. </p>

<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Where the pilgrims make their camels kneel, </p>
<p>Where the blood flows between Isaf and Na’ila, </p>

<p>Tamed ones, between six and nine years old; </p>
<p>You see amulets on them, and alabaster ornaments <br/>
Bound on their necks like date-bearing branches. </p>
<p>I take refuge with the Lord of men from every adversary <br/>
And every lying assailant; </p>
<p>From the hater with his hurtful slander, </p>
<p>And from him who adds to religion what we have not tried. </p>
<p>By Thaur and Him who fixed Thabir in his place. </p>
<p>And by him who goes up and down Hira’ ;* </p>
<p>By the true temple of the valley of Mecca; </p>
<p>By God who is never unmindful; </p>
<p>By the black stone, when they stroke it <br/>
When they go round it morning and evening; </p>
<p>By Abraham’s footprint in the rock still fresh, </p>
<p>With both feet bare, without sandals; </p>
<p>By the running between Marwa and Safa, </p>
<p>And by the statues and images therein; </p>
<p>By every pilgrim riding to the house of God, </p>
<p>And everyone with a vow and everyone on foot; </p>
<p>By Ilal, the furthest sacred spot 2 to which they go <br/>
Where the streamlets open out; </p>
<p>By their halt at even above the mountains <br/>
When they help the camels by their hands to rise ; 3 <br/>
By the night of the meeting, by the stations of Mina, </p>
<p>Are any holy places and stations superior ? </p>
<p>By the crowd, when the home-going horses pass by quickly <br/>
As though escaping from a storm of rain; </p>
<p>By the great stone heap, 4 when they make for it 174 </p>
<p>Aiming at its top with stones; </p>
<p>By Kinda, when they are at al-Hisab at even, </p>
<p>When the pilgrims of Bakr b. Wa’il pass by them <br/>
Two allies who strengthened the tie between them, </p>
<p>And directed to it all means of unity; </p>
<p>1 Hira, Thaur, and Thabir were all mountains round Mecca. </p>
<p>2 Ilal in the Lisan is said to be a strip of sand where the people halt, but the lines in <br/>
Nfibigha 17. 22 and 19. 14 show that it was the name of a sanctuary (and possibly, as Well- <br/>
hausen, p. 83, says, ‘of the God of 'Arafa'). </p>
<p>J The words suggest the way in which men get a reluctant camel to its feet. One man <br/>
pushes up the camel’s chest while the other pulls its head up by the reins. Here perhaps the <br/>
latter action alone is meant as the ‘poet’ is speaking of a halt; even so, ‘they raise the breasts <br/>
of the camels with their hands’ is an unnatural way to speak of pulling on the reins. </p>
<p>4 The largest of the three heaps of stones at Mina, presumably that known as Jamratu <br/>
’ 1 -'Aqaba. Cf. Hassan b. Thabit’s lament where the pilgrims throw seven stones. The rite <br/>
is not mentioned in the Quran, but we shall meet it again in the Sira on pp. 534 and 970 of <br/>
the Arabic text. See further Djamar in E.I. </p>

<p>By their breaking the acacias and shrubs of al-Sifah, 1 <br/>
And its bushes too, as they galloped like flying ostriches. </p>
<p>Is there any better refuge for one who seeks it ? </p>
<p>Is there a righteous god-fearing man who will grant it ? </p>
<p>Our aggressors get their way with us, and wish <br/>
That the gates of Turk and Kabul 2 were blocked with our bodies. <br/>
You lie, by God’s house, we will not leave Mecca, and go forth. <br/>
Until your affairs are in confusion. </p>
<p>You lie, by God’s house, Muhammad shall not be maltreated ; 3 <br/>
Before we shoot and thrust in his defence, </p>
<p>We will not give him up till we lie dead around him, </p>
<p>And be unmindful of our wives and children; </p>
<p>Until a people in arms rise and fight you, </p>
<p>As camels carrying water rise under empty water-skins, 4 <br/>
Until you see the enemy falling face down in his blood <br/>
From the spear thrust weighed down and tottering. </p>
<p>By God, if what I see should become serious <br/>
Our swords will mingle with the best of them <br/>
In the hands of a young warrior, like a flame, </p>
<p>Trustworthy, defender of the truth, hero, </p>
<p>For days, months, a whole year, </p>
<p>And after next year, yet another. </p>
<p>What people, confound you, would abandon a chief, </p>
<p>Who protects his dependants ? No foul-mouthed weakling, </p>
<p>A noble man, for whose sake the clouds drop rain, </p>
<p>The support of orphans, the defence of widows, </p>
<p>Hashim’s family, ready to perish, resort to him, </p>
<p>There they find pity and kindness. </p>
<p>Asid and his firstborn made us hated <br/>
And cut us up for others to devour ; 5 <br/>
Neither 'Uthman nor Qunfudh sympathized with us <br/>
But obeyed the command of those tribes. </p>
<p>1 This line is very difficult, as C.’s notes show. Unfortunately the note of Abu Dharr to <br/>
the effect that <span class="arithmatex">\(ifah is a place-name is omitted. This seems to me to provide the key to the 
meaning of the line. Yaqut says that al-\)</span>ifah lies between Uunayn and the pillars of the <br/>
Uaram on the left of a man entering Mecca from Mushash. As the latter place lies on the <br/>
hills of 'Arafat the rendering given above seems to suit the context. On the site of Uunayn <br/>
see Yaqut sub voce. Weil evades the difficulty, and so, strangely enough, does Suhayli. If </p>
<p>is the plural of $afh, the side of a mountain, I cannot see how the passage can be <br/>
construed. </p>
<p>2 The commentators say that Turk and Kabul are two mountains, but I can find no <br/>
mention of them in Yaqut, who under ‘Kabul’ quotes a line from al-A'sha which clearly <br/>
refers to Turk and Kabul as people. It looks as if the two names point to a later forger. </p>
<p>J I follow the reading of the Lisdn. The text apparently means ‘We will not be forcibly <br/>
deprived of M. </p>
<p>4 Or ‘rattling, swishing water-skins’. If the comparison refers to the speed of their <br/>
attack, the simile which Abu Dharr favours is correct. If not, the simile rests in the noise <br/>
whicl} the armed men make. </p>
<p>5 A figure for ‘malicious slander*. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 125 </p>
<p>They obeyed Ubayy and the son of their 'Abdu Yaguth, </p>
<p>And did not observe what others said of us; </p>
<p>So, too, were we treated by Subay' and Naufal, </p>
<p>And everyone who turned away from us, not treating us kindly. </p>
<p>If they throw down their arms, or God give us the better of them, <br/>
We will pay them measure for measure. </p>
<p>That fellow Abu 'Amr would do naught but hate us, </p>
<p>To send us away among shepherds and camel-drivers; </p>
<p>He talks about us confidentially night and morning. </p>
<p>Talk on, Abu 'Amr, with your guile! </p>
<p>He swears by God he won’t deceive us, </p>
<p>But we see him openly doing nothing else; </p>
<p>He hates us so much that the hill-tops <br/>
Between Mecca’s hills and Syria’s forts <br/>
Are too narrow to hold him. </p>
<p>Ask Abu’l-Walid, what have you done to us with your slander <br/>
Turning away like a deceitful friend. </p>
<p>You were a man by whose opinion men guided their lives, </p>
<p>And you were kind to us, nor are you a fool. </p>
<p>O 'Utba, do not listen to an enemy’s words against us; </p>
<p>Envious, lying, hating and malicious. </p>
<p>Abu Sufyan averted his face from me as he passed, </p>
<p>Sweeping along as though he were one of the great ones of the earth, <br/>
He betook himself to the high ground and its cool waters, </p>
<p>Pretending that he does not forget us. </p>
<p>He tells us that he is sorry for us like a good friend, </p>
<p>But he hides evil designs in his heart. </p>
<p>O, Mut'im! I did not desert you when you called for help, </p>
<p>Nor on the day of battle when mighty deeds were called for, </p>
<p>Nor when they came against you full of enmity, </p>
<p>Opponents whose strength matched yours. </p>
<p>O Mut'im, the people have given you a task to do, </p>
<p>I too when entrusted with a task do not try to evade it. </p>
<p>God requite 'Abdu Shams and Naufal for us <br/>
With evil punishment quick and not delayed, </p>
<p>With an exact balance, not a grain too little, </p>
<p>The balance its own witness that it is exact. </p>
<p>Foolish are the minds of people who exchanged us <br/>
For Banu Khalaf and the Ghayatil. 1 <br/>
We are the pure stock from the summit of Hashim <br/>
And the family of Qusayy in matters of import. </p>
<p>Sahm and Makhzum stirred up against us <br/>
Every scoundrel and low-born churl. </p>
<p>'Abdu Manaf, you are the best of your people, </p>
<p>1 See page 133 of the Arabic text where this line is quoted and explained. </p>
<p>I2 6 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Do not make common cause with every outsider. </p>
<p>You have proved feeble and weak <br/>
And done a thing far from right. </p>
<p>You were till lately the sticks under one pot </p>
<p>But now you are the sticks under many pots and vessels. </p>
<p>Let the Banu 'Abdu Manaf get satisfaction from parting from us, <br/>
Deserting us and leaving us imprisoned in our quarters! </p>
<p>If we are men we shall take revenge 1 for what you have done <br/>
And you will suffer the full effects of war. </p>
<p>The best men among Lu’ayy b. Ghalib, </p>
<p>Every bold chief exiled to us; </p>
<p>The family of Nufayl is the worst that ever trod the earth, </p>
<p>The most contemptible of all the sons of Ma'add. </p>
<p>Tell Qusayy that our cause will be blazed abroad, </p>
<p>And give Qusayy the good news that after us there will be a falling <br/>
apart (among our enemies). </p>
<p>Yet if calamity befell Qusayy one night, </p>
<p>We should have been the first to protect them; </p>
<p>If they fought bravely in defence of their houses, </p>
<p>We should show them how to protect the mothers of children. </p>
<p>Yet every friend and nephew on whom we ought to count </p>
<p>We find useless when put to the test </p>
<p>Except for certain men of Kilab b. Murra </p>
<p>Whom we exempt from the stigma of the deserter; 2 </p>
<p>1 Or ‘bear a grudge’, according to another reading. </p>
<ul>
<li>We came to them by night, they all scattered. </li>
</ul>
<p>Every liar and fool disappeared from our sight. </p>
<p>Ours was the watering-place among them, </p>
<p>We are the rock-like defence of Ghalib. </p>
<p>The young men of the scented ones and Hashim <br/>
Are like sword blades in the hands of the polishers. </p>
<p>They took no revenge, nor shed blood, </p>
<p>Nor do they oppose any but the worst tribes. </p>
<p>In their fighting you see the youths </p>
<p>Like fierce lions quarrelling over lumps of meat; </p>
<p>Sons of a favourite Ethiopian* slave girl, </p>
<p>Sons of Jumab, ‘Ubayd Qays b. 'Aqil; </p>
<p>But we are the noblest stock of lords <br/>
Whose heroic deeds were sung in verse. </p>
<p>These seven verses are not in W.’s text, and as he does not mention them in his critical <br/>
notes it may be assumed that none of his manuscripts contained them. Further, there is <br/>
not a note in Abu Dharr’s commentary, and it is difficult to believe that he would have <br/>
passed over the extraordinary word hindikiya without a note, if the line containing it were <br/>
before him. I.H. at the end of the poem indicates that he has cut out some verses, possibly <br/>
(though I think most improbably) these verses were among them, and even so he says some <br/>
authorities reject the greater part. It will at once be apparent that the seven lines interrupt <br/>
the sequence of thought which deals with the honourable exceptions to the general defec¬ <br/>
tion. In v. 4 I conjecture khdlafu for hdlafu. </p>
<ul>
<li>Hindikiya. Greek and Syrian writers use the term India for South Arabia and Ethiopia <br/>
and a slave girl from one of those countries is almost certainly indicated here. The suffix « <br/>
is the Bahlavi suffix. See A. Jeffery, Foreign Vocabulary of the Quran, Baroda, 1938, pp. 15 f- <br/>

<p>178 name ‘the two-tied-together-ones’ from this, ‘All killed him at the battle <br/>
of Badr. Abu 'Amr is Qurza b. f Abdu 'Amr b. Naufal b. *Abdu Manaf. <br/>
The ‘treacherous people’ are B. Bakr b. 'Abdu Manat b. Kinana. These <br/>
are the Arabs whom Abu Talib enumerated in his verse (174). </p>
<p>When the prophet’s fame began to be blazed abroad throughout the land <br/>
he was mentioned in Medina. There was no tribe among the Arabs who <br/>
knew more about the apostle when and before he was mentioned than this <br/>
tribe of Aus and Khazraj. The reason for this was that they were well <br/>
acquainted with the sayings of Jewish rabbis and they lived side by side <br/>
with them as allies. When the apostle was talked of in Medina and they <br/>
heard of the trouble he had with Quraysh, Abu Qays b. al-Aslat, brother of <br/>
B. Waqif, composed the verses given below (175). </p>
<p>Abu Qays was warmly attached to Quraysh since he was related to them <br/>
through his wife Arnab d. Asad b. ‘Abdu’l-'Uzza b. Qusayy, and he with <br/>
his wife used to stay with them for years at a time. He composed an ode in <br/>
which he magnified the sanctity of the area, forbade Quraysh to fight there, <br/>
urged them to stand by one another, mentioned their merits and virtues, <br/>
urged them to protect the apostle, and reminded them of how God had <br/>
dealt with them and saved them in the War of the Elephant. </p>
<p>O rider, when you meet Lu’ayy ibn Ghalib <br/>
Give him a message from me, </p>
<p>179 The tidings of a man who though far from you </p>
<p>Is distressed at what is between you, sad and worried. </p>
<p>I have become the caravanserai of cares, </p>
<p>Because of them I cannot do what I should. </p>
<p>I learn that you are divided into camps, </p>
<p>One party kindles the fire of war, the other provides the fuel. </p>
<p>I pray God to protect you from your evil act, </p>
<p>Your wicked quarrel and the insidious attack of scorpions, </p>
<p>Defamatory reports and secret plots </p>
<p>Like pricking awls which never fail to pierce. </p>
<p>Remind them of God, first of all things, </p>
<p>And the sin of breaking the taboo on travel-worn gazelles. 1 <br/>
Say to them, (and God will give His judgement) </p>
<p>If you abandon war it will go far from you. </p>
<p>When you stir it up you raise an evil thing; </p>
<p>’Tis a monster devouring everything near and far, </p>
<p>It severs kinship and destroys people; </p>
<p>It cuts the flesh from the hump and the back. </p>
<p>You will give up the finest clothes of Yaman <br/>
For a soldier’s garb and coat of mail, </p>
<p>Musk and camphor for dust-coloured armour <br/>
With buttons like the eyes of a locust. </p>
<p>1 The killing of game within the sacred area was taboo, and the poet means that if the <br/>
blood of animals there is sacrosanct, a fortiori bloodshed and war are forbidden by God. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 129 </p>
<p>Beware of war! Do not let it cling to you; </p>
<p>A stagnant pool has a bitter draught. </p>
<p>War—it first seems fine to men </p>
<p>But afterwards they plainly recognize an old hag. </p>
<p>It scorches unsparingly the weak, </p>
<p>And aims death-dealing blows at the great. </p>
<p>Know you not what happened in the war of Dahis? </p>
<p>Or the war of Hatib? Take a lesson from them! </p>
<p>How many a noble chief it slew, </p>
<p>The generous host whose guest lacked naught, </p>
<p>A huge pile of ashes beneath his pot, </p>
<p>Praised by all, noble in character, his sword <br/>
Drawn only in righteous cause; </p>
<p>’Tis as water poured out at random. </p>
<p>As if winds from all quarters scattered the clouds j 1 <br/>
A truthful, knowledgeable man will tell you of its battles <br/>
(For real knowledge is the result of experience). </p>
<p>So sell your spears to those who love war </p>
<p>And remember the account you must render, for God is the best 180 <br/>
reckoner. </p>
<p>Man’s Lord has chosen a religion, </p>
<p>So let none guard you but the Lord of heaven, </p>
<p>Raise up for us a hanifi religion. </p>
<p>You are our object; one is guided in travel by heights, </p>
<p>You are a light and protection to this people, </p>
<p>You lead the way, not lacking virtues. </p>
<p>If men were valued, you would be a jewel, </p>
<p>The best of the vale is yours in noble pride. </p>
<p>You preserve noble, ancient peoples <br/>
Whose genealogy shows no foreign blood; </p>
<p>You see the needy come to your houses <br/>
Wave after wave of starving wights. </p>
<p>The people know that your leaders </p>
<p>Are ever the best people of the stations of Mina, 2 </p>
<p>Best in counsel, loftiest in custom, </p>
<p>Most truthful amid the assemblies. </p>
<p>1 If the subject of the metaphor is war the reading dalal is right, and indiscriminate <br/>
bloodshed is indicated; if the variant ftxlal ‘porous soil’ is adopted, the poet is continuing <br/>
his description of the generous warrior whose hospitality extends to the most insatiable <br/>
guest. </p>
<ul>
<li>See Al-Suhayli, i8z, who says that 1 . 1 . so explains the word. He is quoting from p. 300 <br/>
of the text, Al-Barql says it was a well at Mina where the blood of the sacrificial victims was <br/>
collected. It was a spot venerated by the Arabs. The word jubjuba apparently means the <br/>
stomach of a ruminant, and naturally a large number of such skins used for carrying water <br/>
would be available there; therefore it is possible that the term ‘people of the stomach skins’ <br/>
simply means Arabs, the people who more than any other used this kind of vessel for carry¬ <br/>
ing food and water, and so the meaning of the poet is that the tribe of Lu’ayy is the finest <br/>
tribe in Arabia. </li>

These are the words of a truthful man (176). </p>
<p>182 Hakim b. Umayya b.Haritha b. al-Auqas al-Sulami, an ally of B. Umayya <br/>
who had become a Muslim, composed the following verses to turn his <br/>
people from their determined enmity to the apostle. He was a man of <br/>
good birth and authority. </p>
<p>Does one who says what is right stick to it, </p>
<p>And is there one listening who would be angry at the truth ? </p>
<p>Does the chief whose tribe hope to profit from him <br/>
Gather friends from near and far ? </p>
<p>I disown all but Him who controls the wind <br/>
And I abandon you for ever. </p>
<p>I submit myself utterly to God <br/>
Though friends threaten me with terror. </p>
<p>183 HOW THE APOSTLE WAS TREATED BY HIS OWN PEOPLE </p>
<p>When the Quraysh became distressed by the trouble caused by the enmity <br/>
between them and the apostle and those of their people who accepted his <br/>
teaching, they stirred up against him foolish men who called him a liar, <br/>
insulted him, and accused him of being a poet, a sorcerer, a diviner, and of <br/>
being possessed. However, the apostle continued to proclaim what God <br/>
had ordered him to proclaim, concealing nothing, and exciting their dislike <br/>
by contemning their religion, forsaking their idols, and leaving them to <br/>
their unbelief. </p>
<p>Yahya b. ‘Urwa b. al-Zubayr on the authority of his father from ‘Abdul¬ <br/>
lah b.' 'Amr b. al-'As told me that the latter was asked what was the worst <br/>
way in which Quraysh showed their enmity to the apostle. He replied: ‘I <br/>
was with them one day when the notables had gathered in the Hijr and the <br/>
apostle was mentioned. They said that they had never known anything <br/>
like the trouble they had endured from this fellow; he had declared their </p>
<ul>
<li>For this and the following lines, except the last, see p. 39 of the Arabic text. </li>
</ul>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 131 </p>
<p>mode of life foolish, insulted their forefathers, reviled their religion, <br/>
divided the community, and cursed their gods. What they had borne was <br/>
past all bearing, or words to that effect.* </p>
<p>While they were thus discussing him the apostle came towards them and <br/>
kissed the black stone, then he passed them as he walked round the temple. </p>
<p>As he passed they said some injurious things about him. This I could see <br/>
from his expression. He went on and as he passed them the second time <br/>
they attacked him similarly. This I could see from his expression. Then <br/>
he passed the third time, and they did the same. He stopped and said, <br/>
‘Will you listen to me O Quraysh? By him who holds my life in His hand <br/>
I bring you slaughter.<em> 1 This word so struck the people that not one of <br/>
them but stood silent and still; even one who had hitherto been most <br/>
violent spoke to him in the kindest way possible, saying, ‘Depart, O Abu’l- <br/>
Qasim, for by God you are not violent. 5 So the apostle went away, and on <br/>
the morrow they assembled in the Hijr, I being there too, and they asked <br/>
one another if they remembered what had taken place between them and <br/>
the apostle so that when he openly said something unpleasant they let him <br/>
alone. While they were talking thus the apostle appeared, and they leaped 184 <br/>
upon him as one man and encircled him, saying, ‘Are you the one who said <br/>
so-and-so against our gods and our religion?</em> The apostle said, ‘Yes, I am <br/>
the one who said that.<em> And I saw one of them seize his robe. Then Abu <br/>
Bakr interposed himself weeping and saying, ‘Would you kill a man for <br/>
saying Allah is my Lord ?</em> Then they left him. That is the worst that I <br/>
ever saw Quraysh do to him. </p>
<p>One of the family of Umm Kulthum, Abu Bakr’s daughter, told me that <br/>
she said, ‘Abu Bakr returned that day with the hair of his head torn. He <br/>
was a very hairy man and they had dragged him along by his beard* (177). </p>
<p>HAMZA ACCEPTS ISLAM </p>
<p>A man of Aslum, who had a good memory, told me that Abu Jahl passed <br/>
by the apostle at al-Safa, insulted him and bel&amp;ved most offensively, speak¬ <br/>
ing spitefully of his religion and trying to bring him into disrepute. The <br/>
apostle did not speak to him. Now a freedwoman, belonging to ‘Abdullah <br/>
b. Jud'an b. ‘Amr b. Ka‘b b. Sa'd b. Taym b. Murra, was in her house <br/>
listening to what went on. When he went away he betook himself to the <br/>
assembly of Quraysh at the Ka'ba and sat there. Within a little while <br/>
Hamza b. ‘Abdu’l-Mujtalib arrived, with his bow hanging from his shoulder, <br/>
returning from the chase, for he was fond of hunting and used to go out <br/>
shooting. When he came back from a hunt he never went home until he <br/>
had circumambulated the Ka'ba, and that done when he passed by an 185 <br/>
assembly of the Quraysh he stopped and saluted and talked with them. He <br/>
was the strongest man of Quraysh, and the most unyielding. The apostle </p>
<p>1 Dhabh. </p>
<p>i; j2 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>had gone back to his house when he passed by this woman, who asked him <br/>
if he had heard of what Abu’l-Hakam b. Hisham had done just recently to <br/>
his nephew, Muhammad; how he had found him sitting quietly there, and <br/>
insulted him, and cursed him, and treated him badly, and that Muhammad <br/>
had answered not a word. Hamza was filled with rage, for God purposed <br/>
to honour him, so he went out at a run and did not stop to greet anyone, <br/>
meaning to punish Abu Jahl when he met him. When he got to the mosque <br/>
he saw him sitting among the people, and went up to him until he stood <br/>
over him, when he lifted up his bow and struck him a violent blow with it, <br/>
saying, ‘Will you insult him when I follow his religion, and say what he <br/>
says ? Hit me back if you can!’ Some of B. Makhzum got up to go to Abu <br/>
Jahl’s help, but he said, ‘Let Abu 'Umara alone for, by God, I insulted <br/>
his nephew deeply.’ Hamzas Islam was complete, and he followed the <br/>
apostle’s commands. When he became a Muslim the Quraysh recognized <br/>
that the apostle had become strong, and had found a protector in Hamza, <br/>
and so they abandoned some of their ways of harassing him. </p>
<p>WHAT *UTBA SAID ABOUT THE PROPHET </p>
<p>Yazid b. Ziyad from Muhammad b. Ka'b al-QurazI told me that he was <br/>
told that 'Utba b. Rabi'a, who was a chief, said one day while he was <br/>
sitting in the Quraysh assembly and the apostle was sitting in the mosque <br/>
by himself, ‘Why should I not go to Muhammad and make some proposals <br/>
to him which if he accepts in part, we will give him whatever he wants, and <br/>
he will leave us in peace?’ This happened when Hamza had accepted Islam <br/>
and they saw that the prophet’s followers were increasing and multiplying. <br/>
They thought it was a good idea, and 'Utba went and sat by the prophet <br/>
186 and said, ‘O my. nephew, you are one of us as you know, of the noblest o <br/>
the tribe and hold a worthy position in ancestry. You have come to your <br/>
people with an important matter, dividing their community thereby and <br/>
ridiculing their customs, and you have insulted their gods and their reli¬ <br/>
gion, and declared that their forefathers were unbelievers, so listen to me <br/>
and I will make some suggestions, and perhaps you will be able to accept <br/>
one of them.’ The apostle agreed, and he went on, ‘If what you want is <br/>
money, we will gather for you of our property so that you may be the richest <br/>
of us; if you want honour, we will make you our chief so that no one can <br/>
decide anything apart from you; if you want sovereignty, we will make you <br/>
king, and if this ghost which comes to you, which you see, is such that you <br/>
cannot get rid of him, we will find a physician for you, and exhaust our <br/>
means in getting you cured, for often a familiar spirit gets possession of a <br/>
man until he can be cured of it,’ or words to that effect. The apostle <br/>
listened patiently, and then said: ‘Now listen to me, “In the name of Go , <br/>
the compassionate and merciful, H.M., a revelation from the compassion¬ <br/>
ate, the merciful, a book whose verses are expounded as an Arabic Quran <br/>
for a -people who understand, as an announcement and warning, thoug </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 133 </p>
<p>most of them turn aside not listening and say, ‘Our hearts are veiled from <br/>
that to which you invite us.”” 1 Then the apostle continued to recite it to <br/>
him. When 'Utba heard it from him, he listened attentively, putting his <br/>
hands behind his back and leaning on them as he listened. Then the <br/>
prophet ended at the prostration 2 and prostrated himself, and said, ‘You <br/>
have heard what you have heard, Abu’l-Walid; the rest remains with you.’ <br/>
When 'Utba returned to his companions they noticed that his expression <br/>
had completely altered, and they asked him what had happened. He said <br/>
that he had heard words such as he had never heard before, which were <br/>
neither poetry, spells, nor witchcraft. ‘Take my advice and do as I do, <br/>
leave this man entirely alone for, by God, the words which I have heard 187 <br/>
will be blazed abroad. If (other) Arabs kill him, others will have rid you <br/>
of him; if he gets the better of the Arabs, his sovereignty will be your <br/>
sovereignty, his power your power, and you will be prosperous through <br/>
him.’ They said, ‘He has bewitched you with his tongue,’ To which he <br/>
answered, ‘You have my opinion, you must do what you think fit.’ </p>
<p>NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE APOSTLE AND THE </p>
<p>LEADERS OF QURAYSH AND AN EXPLANATION OF THE <br/>
SURA OF THE CAVE </p>
<p>Islam began to spread in Mecca among men and women of the tribes of <br/>
Quraysh, though Quraysh were imprisoning and seducing as many of the <br/>
Muslims as they could. A traditionist told me from Sa'id b. Jubayr and <br/>
from Tkrima, freedman of 'Abdullah b. 'Abbas, that the leading men of <br/>
every clan of Quraysh—'Utba b. Rabi'a, and Shayba his brother, and Abu <br/>
Sufyan b. Harb, and al-Nadr b. al-Harith, brother of the Banu Abdu’I-Dar, <br/>
and Abu’l-Bakhtari b. Hisham, and al-Aswad b. al-Muftalib b. Asad and <br/>
Zama'a b. al-Aswad, and al-Walld b. al-Mughlra, and Abu Jahl b. Hisham, <br/>
and 'Abdullah b. Abu Umayya, and al-'As b. Wa’il, and Nubayh and <br/>
Munabbih, the sons of al-Hajjaj, both of Sahm, and Umayya b. Khalaf <br/>
and possibly others—gathered together after sunset outside the Ka'ba. <br/>
They decided to send for Muhammad and to negptiate and argue with him <br/>
so that they could not be held to blame on his account in the future. When <br/>
they sent for him the apostle came quickly because he thought that what <br/>
he had said to them had made an impression, for he was most zealous for <br/>
their welfare, and their wicked way of life pained him. When he came and <br/>
sat down with them, they explained that they had sent for him in order <br/>
that they could talk together. No Arab had ever treated his tribe as <br/>
Muhammad had treated them, and they repeated the charges which have 188 <br/>
been mentioned on several occasions. If it was money he wanted, they <br/>
would make him the richest of them all; if it was honour, he should be <br/>
their prince; if it was sovereignty, they would make him king; if it was a </p>
<p>Sura 41. I. 1 i.e, verse 37 'Prostrate yourselves to God*. </p>
<p>134 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>spirit which had got possession of him (they used to call the familiar spirit <br/>
of the jinn rdiy), then they would exhaust their means in finding medicine <br/>
to cure him. The apostle replied that he had no such intention. He sought <br/>
not money, nor honour, nor sovereignty, but God had sent him as an <br/>
apostle, and revealed a book to him, and commanded him to become an <br/>
announcer and a wamer. He had brought them the messages of his Lord, <br/>
and given them good advice. If they took it then they would have a portion <br/>
in this world and the next; if they rejected it, he could only patiently await <br/>
the issue until God decided between them, or words to that effect. ‘Well, <br/>
Muhammad, 1 they said, ‘if you won’t accept any of our propositions, you <br/>
know that no people are more short of land and water, and live a harder life <br/>
than we, so ask your Lord, who has sent you, to remove for us these <br/>
mountains which shut us in, and to straighten out our country for us, and <br/>
to open up in it rivers like those of Syria and Iraq, and to resurrect for us <br/>
our forefathers, and let there be among those that are resurrected for us <br/>
Qusayy b. Kilab, for he was a true shaikh, so that we may ask them whether <br/>
what you say is true or false. If they say you are speaking the truth, and <br/>
you do what we have asked you, we will believe in you, and we shall know <br/>
what your position with God is, and that He has actually sent you as an <br/>
apostle as you say. 1 He replied that he had not been sent to them with such <br/>
an object. He had conveyed to them God's message, and they could either <br/>
89 accept it with advantage, or reject it and await God’s judgement. They <br/>
said that if he would not do that for them, let him do something for himself. <br/>
Ask God to send an angel with him to confirm what he said and to contra¬ <br/>
dict them; to make him gardens and castles, and treasures of gold and <br/>
silver to satisfy his obvious wants. He stood in the streets as they did, and <br/>
he sought a livelihood as they did. If he could do this, they would recognize <br/>
his merit and position with God, if he were an apostle as he claimed to be. <br/>
He replied that he would not do it, and would not ask for such things, for <br/>
he was not sent to do so, and he repeated what he had said before. They <br/>
said, ‘Then let the heavens be dropped on us in pieces, 1 as you assert that <br/>
your Lord could do if He wished, for we will not believe you unless you <br/>
do so.’ The apostle replied that this was a matter for God; if He wanted to <br/>
do it with them, He would do it. They said, ‘Did not your Lord know that <br/>
we would sit with you, and ask you these questions, so that He might come <br/>
to you and instruct you how to answer us, and tell you what He was going <br/>
to do with us, if we did not receive your message ? Information has reached <br/>
us that you are taught by this fellow in al-Yamama, called al-Rahm&amp;n, and <br/>
by God we will never believe in the Rahman. Our conscience is clear. By <br/>
God, we will not leave you and our treatment of you, until either we <br/>
destroy you or you destroy us.’ Some said, ‘We worship the angels, who <br/>
are the daughters of Allah.’ Others said, ‘We will not believe in you until <br/>
you come to us with God and the angels as a surety.’ 1 </p>
<p>When they said this the apostle got up and left them. ‘Abdullah b. Abu </p>
<p>1 Cf. Sura 17. 94. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 135 </p>
<p>Umayya b. al-Mughira b. 'Abdullah b. 'Umar b. Makhzum (who was the <br/>
son of his aunt ‘Atika d. of 'Abdu’l-Muttalib) got up with him and said to <br/>
him, ‘O Muhammad, your people have made you certain propositions, <br/>
which you have rejected; first they asked you things for themselves that <br/>
they might know that your position with God is what you say it is so that <br/>
they might believe in you and follow you, and you did nothing; then they <br/>
asked you to take something for yourself, by which they might know your <br/>
superiority over them and your standing with God, and you would not do 190 <br/>
it; then they asked you to hasten some of the punishment with which you <br/>
were frightening them, and you did not do it’, or words to that effect, ‘and <br/>
by God, I will never believe in you until you get a ladder to the sky, and <br/>
mount up it until you come to it, while I am looking on, and until four <br/>
angels shall come with you, testifying that you are speaking the truth, and <br/>
by God, even if you did that I do not think I should believe you.’ Then he <br/>
went away, and the apostle went to his family, sad and grieving, because <br/>
his hope that they had called him to accept his preaching was vain, and <br/>
because of their estrangement from him. When the apostle had gone Abu <br/>
Jahl spoke, making the usual charges against him, and saying, ‘I call God <br/>
to witness that I will wait for him tomorrow with a stone which I can <br/>
hardly lift,’ or words to that effect, ‘and when he prostrates himself in <br/>
prayer I will split his skull with it. Betray me or defend me, let the B. <br/>
'Abdu Manaf do what they like after that.’ They said that they would <br/>
never betray him on any account, and he could carry on with his project. <br/>
When morning came Abu Jahl took a stone and sat in wait for the apostle, <br/>
who behaved as usual that morning. While he was in Mecca he faced <br/>
Syria in prayer, and when he prayed, he .prayed between the southern <br/>
comer and the black stone, putting the Ka'ba between himself and Syria. </p>
<p>The apostle rose to pray while Quraysh sat in their meeting, waiting for <br/>
what Abu Jahl was to do. When the apostle prostrated himself, Abu Jahl <br/>
took up the stone and went towards him, until when he got near him, he <br/>
turned back in flight, pale with terror, and his hand had withered upon the <br/>
stone, so that he cast the stone from his hand. The Quraysh asked him <br/>
what had happened, and he replied that when he got near him a camel’s <br/>
stallion got in his way. ‘By God’, he said, ‘I have never seen anything like 191 <br/>
his head, shoulders, and teeth on any stallion before, and he made as <br/>
though he would eat me.’ </p>
<p>I was told that the apostle said, ‘That was Gabriel. If he had come near, <br/>
he would have seized him.’ </p>
<p>When Abu Jahl said that to them, al-Nadr b. al-Harith b. Kalada b. <br/>
'Alqama b. Abdu Man 3 f b. Abdu’l-Dar b. Qusayy (178) got up and said: ‘O <br/>
Quraysh, a situation has arisen which you cannot deal with. Muhammad <br/>
was a young man most liked among you, most truthful in speech, and most <br/>
trustworthy, until, when you saw grey hairs on his temple, and he brought <br/>
you his message, you said he was a sorcerer, but he is not, for we have seen <br/>
such people and their spitting and their knots; you said, a diviner, but we </p>
<p>136 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>have seen such people and their behaviour, and we have heard their <br/>
rhymes; and you said a poet, but he is not a poet, for we have heard all <br/>
kinds of poetry; you said he was possessed, but he is not, for we have seen <br/>
the possessed, and he shows no signs of their gasping and whispering and <br/>
delirium. Ye men of Quraysh, look to your affairs, for by God, a serious <br/>
thing has befallen you.’ Now al-Nadr b. al-Harith was one of the satans of <br/>
Quraysh; he used to insult the apostle and show him enmity. He had been <br/>
to al-IJIra and learnt there the tales of the kings of Persia, the tales of <br/>
Rustum and Isbandiyar. When the apostle had held a meeting in which <br/>
he reminded them of God, and warned his people of what had happened <br/>
to bygone generations as a result of God's vengeance, al-Nadr got up when <br/>
he sat down, and said, ‘I can tell a better story than he, come to me.’ Then <br/>
he began to tell them about the kings of Persia, Rustum and Isbandiyar, <br/>
and then he would say, ‘In what respect is Muhammad a better story-teller <br/>
19a than I?’ (179). </p>
<p>Ibn ‘Abbas, according to my information, used to say eight verses of the <br/>
Quran came down in reference to him, ‘When our verses are read to him, <br/>
he says fairy tales of the ancients’ ;* and all those passages in the Quran in <br/>
which ‘fairy tales’ are mentioned. </p>
<p>When Al-Nadr said that to them, they sent him and 'Uqba b. Abu <br/>
Mu'ayt to the Jewish rabbis in Medina and said to them, ‘Ask them about <br/>
Muhammad; describe him to them and tell them what he says, for they <br/>
are the first people of the scriptures and have knowledge which we do not <br/>
possess about the prophets.’ They carried out their instructions, and said <br/>
to the rabbis, ‘You are the people of the Taurat, 2 and we have come to <br/>
you so that you can tell us how to deal with this tribesman of ours.’ The <br/>
rabbis said, ‘Ask him about three things of which we will instruct you; if <br/>
he gives you the right answer then he is an authentic prophet, but if he <br/>
does not, then the man is a rogue, so form your own opinion about him. <br/>
Ask him what happened to the young men who disappeared in ancient <br/>
days, for they have a marvellous story. Ask him about the mighty traveller <br/>
who reached the confines of both East and West. Ask him what the spirit <br/>
is. If he can give you the answer, then follow him, for he is a prophet. If <br/>
he cannot, then he is a forger and treat him as you will.’ The two men <br/>
returned to Quraysh at Mecca 3 and told them that they had. a decisive way <br/>
of dealing with Muhammad, and they told them about the tnree questions. </p>
<p>They came to the apostle and called upon him to answer these questions. <br/>
193 He said to/ihem, ‘I will give you your answer tomorrow,’ but he did not <br/>
say, ‘if God will.’ So they went away; and the apostle, so they say, waited <br/>
for fifteen days without a revelation from God on the matter, nor did <br/>
Gabriel come to him, so that the people of Mecca began to spread evil </p>
<p>1 Sun 68. 15. </p>
<p>1 Properly the Lew of Moses, but often used by Muslim writers of the Old Testament as <br/>
a whole. </p>
<ul>
<li>Mecca is tome 180 m. from Medina. The ordinary-caravan took 10 or 11 days. The <br/>
fayydra going via al-Khabt did the journey in 5 days. </li>
</ul>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 137 </p>
<p>reports, saying, ‘Muhammad promised us an answer on the morrow, and <br/>
today is the fifteenth day we have remained without an answer.’ This <br/>
delay caused the apostle great sorrow, until Gabriel brought him the <br/>
Chapter of The Cave, in which he reproaches him for his sadness, and <br/>
told him the answers of their questions, the youths, the mighty traveller, <br/>
and the spirit. </p>
<p>I was told that the apostle said to Gabriel when he came, ‘You have shut <br/>
yourself off from me, Gabriel, so that I became apprehensive.’ He <br/>
answered, ‘We descend only by God’s command, whose is what lies <br/>
before us, behind us, and what lies between, and thy Lord does not <br/>
forget.’ 1 </p>
<p>He began the Sura with His own praise, and mentioning (Muhammad’s) <br/>
prophethood and apostolate and their denial thereof, and He said, ‘Glory <br/>
belongs to God, who has revealed the book to His servant,’ 2 meaning <br/>
Muhammad. </p>
<p>‘Verily thou art an apostle from Me,’ i.e. confirming what they ask about <br/>
thy prophethood. ‘He hath not made therein crookedness, it is straight,’ <br/>
i.e. it is level, without any difference. ‘To warn of a severe punishment <br/>
from Him,’ that is, His immediate judgement in this world. ‘And a painful <br/>
judgement in the next,’ that is, from thy Lord, who has sent thee as an <br/>
apostle. ‘To give those who believe, who do good works, the good news <br/>
that they will have a glorious reward, enjoying it everlastingly,’ i.e. the <br/>
eternal abode. ‘They shall not die therein,’ i.e. those who have accepted <br/>
your message as true, though others have denied it, and have done the <br/>
works that you have ordered them to do. ‘And to warn those who say God <br/>
has taken a son.’ He means the Quraysh when they say, ‘We worship the <br/>
angels who are the daughters of Allah.’ ‘They have no knowledge about it, <br/>
nor had their forefathers’, who take hardly your leaving them and shaming <br/>
their religion. ‘Dreadful is the word that proceedeth from their mouth’ <br/>
when they say the angels are God’s daughters. ‘They say nothing but a 194 <br/>
lie, and it may be that thou wilt destroy thyself,’ 0 Muhammad. ‘In grief <br/>
over their course if they believe not this saying,’ i.e. because of his sorrow <br/>
when he was disappointed of his hope of them; i.e. thou shalt not do it <br/>
(180). ‘Verily We have made that which is upon the earth an ornament <br/>
to it to try them which of them will behave the best,’ i.e. which of them <br/>
will follow My commandment and act in obedience to Me. ‘And verily <br/>
we will make that which is upon it a barren mound,’ i.e. the earth and what <br/>
is upon it will perish and pass away, for all must return to Me that I may <br/>
reward them according to their deeds, so do not despair nor let what you <br/>
hear and see therein grieve you (181). </p>
<p>Then comes the story of w T hat they asked him about the young men, and <br/>
God said: ‘Have you considered that the dwellers in the Cave and al- <br/>
Raqim were wonders from our signs ?’ i.e. there were still more wonderful <br/>
signs in the proofs I have given to men (182). Then God said: ‘When the 195 </p>
<p>1 Sura 19. 65. 1 Sura 18. </p>
<p>138 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>young men took refuge in the Cave they said, O Lord, show us kindness <br/>
and give us guidance by Your command, so We sealed up their hearing in <br/>
the Cave for many years. Then We brought them to life again that We <br/>
might know which of the two parties would best calculate the time that <br/>
they had been there.’ Then He said: ‘We will tell you the true account of <br/>
them; they were young men who believed in their Lord, and We gave them <br/>
further guidance, and We strengthened their hearts. Then they stood and <br/>
said, Our Lord is the Lord of heaven and earth. We will pray to no other <br/>
god but Him. If we were to say otherwise we should speak blasphemy,’ <br/>
i.e. they did not associate anyone with Me as you have associated with Me <br/>
what you know nothing about (183). ‘These people of ours have chosen <br/>
gods in addition to Him, though they bring no plain authority for them,’ <br/>
i.e. a clear proof. ‘Who is more wicked than he who invents a lie against <br/>
God ? When you withdraw from them and what they worship instead of <br/>
God, then take refuge in the Cave; your Lord will spread for you by His <br/>
mercy and prepare a pillow for you in your plight. You might see the <br/>
sun when it rises move away from their Cave towards the right, and when <br/>
it sets it would go past them to the left, while they were in a cleft of the </p>
<p>196 Cave’ (184). ‘That was one of the signs of God’, i.e. for a proof against <br/>
those of the people of the scriptures who knew their story and who ordered <br/>
those men to ask you about them concerning the truth of your prophecy in <br/>
giving a true account of them. ‘Whom God guides is rightly guided, and <br/>
for him whom He leads astray you will find no friend to direct. And <br/>
you would think they were awake while they were sleeping, and we would <br/>
turn them over to the right and the left, while their dog was lying with its <br/>
forepaws on the threshold’ (185). ‘If you observed them closely you would <br/>
turn your backs on them fleeing, and be afraid of them’ up to the words <br/>
‘those who gained their point said,’ i.e. the people of power and dominion <br/>
among them. ‘Let us build a mosque above them; they will say,’ i.e. the <br/>
Jewish rabbis who ordered them to ask these questions. ‘Three, their dog <br/>
being the fourth of them, and some say five, their sixth being the dog, <br/>
guessing in the dark,’ i.e. they know nothing about it, ‘and they say seven <br/>
and their dog the eighth. Say: My Lord knows best about their number; <br/>
none knows them save a few, so do not contend with them except with an <br/>
open contention,’ i.e. do not be proud with them. ‘And do not ask anyone <br/>
information about them,’ for they know nothing about it. ‘And do not say <br/>
of anything I will do it tomorrow unless you say, If God will. And men¬ <br/>
tion your Lord if you have forgotten and say, Perhaps my Lord will guide <br/>
me to a nearer way of truth than this,’ i.e. do not say about anything which <br/>
they ask you what you said about this, viz. I will tell you tomorrow, and <br/>
make God’s will the condition, and remember Him when you have for¬ <br/>
gotten to do so and say, Perhaps my Lord will guide me to what is better <br/>
than what they ask of me in guidance, for you do not know what I am </p>
<p>197 doing about it. ‘And they remained in their Cave three hundred years <br/>
and they added nine,* i.e. they will say this. ‘Say: Your Lord knows best </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 139 </p>
<p>how long they stayed there. The secrets of heaven and earth are with Him. <br/>
How wonderfully He sees and hears. They have no friend but Him, and <br/>
He allows none in His dominion as a partner,’ i.e. nothing of what they <br/>
ask you is hidden from Him. </p>
<p>And He said about what they asked him in regard to the mighty traveller, <br/>
‘And they will ask you about Dhu’l-Qamayn; say, I will recite to you a <br/>
remembrance of him. Verily We gave him power in the earth, and We <br/>
gave to him every road and he followed it'; so far as the end of his story. </p>
<p>It is said that he attained what no other mortal attained. Roads were <br/>
stretched out before him until he traversed the whole earth, east and west. </p>
<p>He was given power over every land he trod on until he reached the farthest <br/>
confines of creation. </p>
<p>A man who used to purvey stories of the foreigners, 1 which were handed <br/>
down among them, told me that Dhu’l-Qamayn was an Egyptian, whose <br/>
name was Marzuban b. Mardhaba, the Greek, descended from Yunan b. <br/>
Yafith b. Nuh (186). </p>
<p>Thaur b. Yazld from Khalid b. Ma'dan al-Kala'i, who was a man who <br/>
reached Islamic times, told me that the apostle was asked about Dhu’l- <br/>
Qamayn, and he said, ‘He is an angel who measured the e^rth beneath by <br/>
ropes.’ </p>
<p>Khalid said, “Umar heard a man calling someone Dhu’l-Qamayn, and <br/>
he said, “God pardon you, are you not satisfied to use the names of <br/>
the prophets for your children that you must now name them after the <br/>
angels?”’ God knows the truth of the matter, whether the apostle said <br/>
that or not. If he said it, then what he said was true. </p>
<p>God said concerning what they asked him about the Spirit, ‘They will <br/>
ask you about the Spirit, say, the Spirit is a matter for my Lord, and you <br/>
have only a little knowledge about it.’ 2 </p>
<p>I was told on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbas that he said, When the apostle <br/>
came to Medina, the Jewish rabbis said, ‘When you said, “And you have <br/>
only a little knowledge about it,” did you mean us or your own people?’ </p>
<p>He said, ‘Both of you.’ They said, ‘Yet you will read in what you brought 198 <br/>
that we were given the Taurat in which is an exposition of everything.’ He <br/>
replied that in reference to God’s knowledge that was little, but in it there <br/>
was enough for them if they carried it out. God revealed concerning what <br/>
they asked him about that ‘If all the trees in the world were pens and the <br/>
ocean were ink, though the seven seas reinforced it, the words of God <br/>
would not be exhausted. Verily God is mighty and wise.’ 3 i.e. The Taurat <br/>
compared with God’s knowledge is little. And God revealed to him con¬ <br/>
cerning what his people asked him for themselves, namely, removing the <br/>
mountains, and cutting the earth, and raising their forefathers from the <br/>
dead, ‘If there were a QurSn by which mountains could be moved, or <br/>
the earth split, or the dead spoken to [it would be this one], but to God <br/>
belongs the disposition of all things,’ i.e. I will not do anything of the kind </p>
<p>1 Or 'the Persians’. 1 Sura 17. 87. 3 Sura 31. 26. </p>
<p>140 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>unless I choose. And He revealed to him concerning their saying, ‘Take <br/>
for yourself’, meaning that He should make for him gardens, and castles, <br/>
and treasures, and should send an angel with him to confirm what he said, <br/>
and to defend him. ‘And they said, “What is this apostle doing, eating <br/>
food, and walking in the markets ? Unless an angel were sent to him to be <br/>
a warner with him, or he were given a treasure or a garden from which he <br/>
might eat [we would not believe]”; and the evildoers say, “You follow only <br/>
a man bewitched”. See how’ they have coined proverbs of thee, and have <br/>
gone astray and cannot find the w r ay. Blessed is He, who if He willed, <br/>
could make for thee something better than that,’ i.c. than that you should <br/>
walk in the marketplaces, seeking a livelihood. ‘Gardens beneath which <br/>
run rivers, and make for thee castles.’ 1 </p>
<p>And He revealed to him concerning their saying, ‘When We sent messen¬ <br/>
gers before thee they did eat and walk in the markets, and wc made some <br/>
of you a test for others, whether you would be steadfast, and your Lord is <br/>
looking on,’ 2 i.e. I made some of you a test for others that you might be <br/>
steadfast. Had I wanted to make the world side with my apostles, so that <br/>
they w'ould not oppose them, I would have done so. </p>
<p>And he revealed to him concerning what 'Abdullah b. Umayya said, <br/>
‘And they said, “We will not believe in thee until fountains burst forth for </p>
<p>199 us from the earth, or you have a garden of dates and grapes and make the <br/>
rivers within it burst forth copiously, or make the heavens fall upon us in <br/>
fragments as you assert, or bring God and the angels as a surety, or you get <br/>
a house of gold, or mount up to heaven, we will not believe in thy ascent <br/>
until you bring down to us a book w r hich w r e can read.” Say: exalted be my <br/>
Lord, am I aught but a mortal messenger’ (187), 3 </p>
<p>200 He revealed to him with reference to their saying ‘We have heard that a <br/>
man in al-Yamama called al-Rahman teaches you. We will never believe <br/>
in him’. ‘Thus did We send you to a people before whom other peoples <br/>
had passed aw r ay that you might read to them that which We have revealed <br/>
to thee, w'hile they disbelieved in the Rahman. Say, He is my Lord, there <br/>
is no other God but He. In Him I trust and unto Him is the return.’ 4 </p>
<p>And He revealed to him concerning what Abu Jahl said and intended: <br/>
‘Have you seen him who prohibited a servant when he prayed, have you <br/>
seen if he was rightly guided or gave orders in the fear of God, have you <br/>
seen if he lied and turned his back; does he not know that Allah sees <br/>
everything? If he does not cease we will drag him by the forelock, the <br/>
lying sinful forelock; let him call his gang, we will call the guards of hell. <br/>
Thou shalt certainly not obey him, prostrate thyself and draw near to <br/>
God’ (188). </p>
<p>201 And God revealed concerning wLat they proposed to him in regard to <br/>
their money, ‘Say, I ask no rew r ard of you, it is yours; my reward is God’s <br/>
concern alone and He witnesses everything.’ 5 When the apostle brought </p>
<p>1 Sura 25. 8. </p>
<p>4 Sura 13. 29. </p>
<p>2 Sura 25. 22. </p>
<p>3 Sura 17. 92. <br/>
5 Sura 34. 46, </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 141 </p>
<p>to them w r hat they knew was the truth so that they recognized his truthful¬ <br/>
ness and his position as a prophet in bringing them tidings of the unseen <br/>
when they asked him about it, envy prevented them from admitting his <br/>
truth, and they became insolent against God and openly forsook his com¬ <br/>
mandments and took refuge in their polytheism. One of them said, ‘Do <br/>
not listen to this Quran; treat it as nonsense and probably you will get the <br/>
better of it’, i.e. treat it as nonsense and false; and treat him as a mere <br/>
raver—you will probably get the better of him, whereas if you argue or <br/>
debate with him any time he will get the better of you. </p>
<p>Abu Jahl, when he was mocking the apostle and his message one day, <br/>
said: ‘Muhammad pretends that God’s troops who will punish you in hell <br/>
and imprison you there, are nineteen only, while you have a large popula¬ <br/>
tion. Can it be that every hundred of you is unequal to one man of them ?’ </p>
<p>In reference to that God revealed, ‘We have made the guardians of hell <br/>
angels, and We have made the number of them a trial to those who dis¬ <br/>
believe’, to the end of the passage. 1 Whereupon when the apostle recited <br/>
the Quran loudly as he was praying, they began to disperse and refused to <br/>
listen to him. If anyone of them wanted to hear w r hat he was reciting as he 202 <br/>
prayed, he had to listen stealthily for fear of Quraysh; and if he saw that <br/>
they knew that he w r as listening to it, he went away for fear of punishment <br/>
and listened no more. If the apostle lowered his voice, then the man who <br/>
was listening thought that they would not listen to any part of the reading, <br/>
w'hile he himself heard something which they could not hear, by giving all <br/>
his attention to the words. </p>
<p>Da’ud b. al-Husayn freedman of ‘Amr b. 'Uthman told me that 'Ikrima <br/>
freedman of Ibn ‘Abbas had told them that 'Abdullah b. 'Abbas had told <br/>
them that the verse, ‘Don’t speak loudly in thy prayer and don’t be silent; <br/>
adopt a middle course,’ 2 was revealed because of those people. He said, <br/>
‘Don’t speak loudly in thy prayer’ so that they may go away from you, and <br/>
‘Don’t be silent’ so that he who w'ants to hear, of those who listen stealthily, <br/>
cannot hear; perhaps he wall give heed to some of it and profit thereby. </p>

<p>Yahya b. 'Urwa b. al-Zubayr told me as from his father that the first man <br/>
to speak the Quran loudly in Mecca after the apostle w r as 'Abdullah b. <br/>
Mas'ud. The prophet’s companions came together one day and remarked <br/>
that Quraysh had never heard the Quran distinctly read to them, and w'ho <br/>
w r as there who w r ould make them listen to it? When 'Abdullah said that <br/>
he w'ould, they replied that they were afraid on his behalf and they wanted <br/>
only a man of good family who w'ould protect him from the populace if <br/>
they attacked him. He replied, ‘Let me alone, for God will protect me.’ <br/>
So in the morning he w r ent to the sanctuary while Quraysh were in their </p>
<p>1 Sura 74. 31. </p>
<p>2 Sura 17. I 10 , </p>
<p>142 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>conferences, and when he arrived at the Maqam, he read, ‘In the name of <br/>
God, the compassionate, the merciful,’ 1 raising his voice as he did so, ‘the <br/>
compassionate who taught the Quran.’ Then he turned towards them as <br/>
he read so that they noticed him, and they said, ‘What on earth is this son <br/>
of a slavewoman saying?’ And when they realized that he was reading <br/>
some of what Muhammad prayed, they got up and began to hit him in the <br/>
face; but he continued to read so far as God willed that he should read. <br/>
Then he went to his companions with the marks of their blows on his face. <br/>
203 They said, ‘This is just what we feared would happen to you.’ He said, <br/>
‘God’s enemies were never more contemptible in my sight than they are <br/>
now, and if you like I will go and do the same thing before them tomorrow.’ <br/>
They said, ‘No, you have done enough, you have made them listen to what <br/>
they don’t want to hear.’ </p>
<p>THE QURAYSH LISTEN TO THE PROPHET’S READING </p>
<p>Muhammad b. Muslim b. Shihab al-Zuhri told me that he was told that <br/>
Abu Sufyan b. Harb and Abu Jahl b. Hisham and al-Akhnas b. Shariq b. <br/>
'Amr b. Wahb al-Thaqafi, an ally of B. Zuhra, had gone out by night to <br/>
listen to the apostle as he was praying in his house. Everyone of them <br/>
chose a place to sit where he could listen, and none knew where his fellow <br/>
was sitting. So they passed the night listening to him, until as the dawn <br/>
rose, they dispersed. On the w'ay home they met and reproached one <br/>
another, and one said to the other, ‘Don’t do it again, for if one of the <br/>
light-minded fools sees you, you will arouse suspicion in his mind.’ Then <br/>
they went away, until on the second night everyone of them returned again <br/>
to his place, and they passed the night listening. Then at dawn the same <br/>
thing happened again, and again on the third night, when on the morrow <br/>
they said to one another, ‘We will not go away until we take a solemn <br/>
obligation that we will not return.’ This they did and then dispersed. In <br/>
the morning al-Akhnas took his stick and went to the house of Abu <br/>
Sufyan, and asked him to tell him his opinion ofiwhat he had heard from <br/>
Muhammad. He replied, ‘By God, I heard things that I know, and know <br/>
what was meant by them, and I heard things whose meaning I don’t <br/>
know, nor what was intended by them.’ Al-Akhnas replied, ‘I feel precisely <br/>
the same.’ Then he left him and went to Abu Jahl’s house, and asked him <br/>
the same question. He answered, ‘What did I hear! We and B. ‘Abdu Manaf <br/>
204 have been rivals in honour. They have fed the poor, and so have we; <br/>
they have assumed others’ burdens, and so have we; they have been <br/>
generous, and so have we, until we have progressed side by side, 2 and we <br/>
were like tw'o horses of equal speed. They said,“We have a prophet to <br/>
w'hom revelation comes from heaven”, and w'hen shall we attain anything </p>
<p>1 Sura 55. 1. </p>
<p>2 Lit., 'until we have squatted on our knees face to face’, i.e. as complete equals. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 143 </p>
<p>like that? By God, w r e will never believe in him and treat him as truthful.’ <br/>
Then al-Akhnas got up and left him. </p>
<p>When the apostle recited the Quran to them and called them to God, <br/>
they said in mockery, ‘Our hearts are veiled, w'e do not understand what <br/>
you say. There is a load in our ears so that we cannot hear what you say, <br/>
and a curtain divides us from you, so follow' your own path and we will follow <br/>
ours, we do not understand anything you say.’ Then God revealed, ‘And <br/>
when you read the Quran w'e put between you and those who do not believe <br/>
in the last day a hidden veil,’ 1 as far as the words ‘and W'hen you mention <br/>
your Lord alone in the Quran they turn their backs in aversion’, that is, <br/>
how can they understand thy assertion that thy Lord is one if I have put <br/>
veils over their hearts and heaviness in their ears, and between you and <br/>
them is a curtain as they allege?’ i.e. that I have not done it. ‘We know <br/>
best about w'hat they listen to w'hen they listen to you, and when they take <br/>
secret counsel, the wicked say, “You arc only following a man bewitched”,’ <br/>
i.e. that is the way they order people not to listen to the message I have <br/>
given you. ‘See how they have made parables of you, and gone astray, <br/>
and cannot find the way,’ i.e. they have made false proverbs about you, <br/>
and cannot find the right path, and w'hat they say is not straightforward. <br/>
‘And they say, when we are bones and dried morsels shall w r e be raised a new <br/>
creation?’ i.e. you have come to tell us that we shall be raised after death <br/>
w'hen we are bones and dried fragments, and that is something that cannot <br/>
be. ‘Say, Be ye hard stones or iron, or anything that you think in your <br/>
minds is harder, they will say, “Who will raise us?” Say, He w'ho created <br/>
you in the beginning,’ i.e. He who created you from w'hat you know', for to <br/>
create you from dust is no more difficult than that to him. </p>
<p>‘Abdullah b. Abu Najlh from Mujahid from Ibn 'Abbas told me that the <br/>
latter said, ‘I asked him what was meant by the word of God “or something <br/>
that you think is harder” and he said, “Death.” ’ </p>
<p>THE POLYTHEISTS PERSECUTE THE MUSLIMS OP THE 205 </p>
<p>LOWER CLASSES </p>
<p>Then the Quraysh showed their enmity to all those who followed the <br/>
apostle; every clan which contained Muslims attacked them, imprisoning <br/>
them, and beating them, allowing them no food or drink, and exposing <br/>
them to the burning heat of Mecca, so as to seduce them from their religion. <br/>
Some gave w r ay under pressure of persecution, and others resisted them, <br/>
being protected by God. </p>
<p>Bilal, who was afterwards freed by Abu Bakr but at that time belonged <br/>
to one of B. Jumah, being slave born, w'as a faithful Muslim, pure of heart. </p>
<p>His father’s name was Ribah and his mother was Hamama. Umayya b. <br/>
Khalaf b. Wahb b. Hudbafa b. Jumah used to bring him out at the hottest </p>
<p>1 Sura 17. 47. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>part of the day and throw him on his back in the open valley and have a <br/>
great rock put on his chest; then he would say to him, ‘You will stay here <br/>
till you die or deny Muhammad and worship Al-Lat and ah Uzza. He <br/>
used to say while he was enduring this, One, one! </p>
<p>Hisham b. 'Urwa told me on the authority of his father: Waraqa b. <br/>
Naufal was passing him while he was being thus tortured and saying, <br/>
‘One, one,’ and he said, ‘One, one, by God, Bilal.’ Then he went to <br/>
Umayya and those of B. Jumah who had thus maltreated him, and said, </p>
<p>‘I sw’ear by God that if you kill him in this way I will make his tom. a <br/>
shrine.’ One day Abu Bakr passed by while they were thus ill-treating <br/>
him, for his house w r as among this clan. He said to Umayya, ‘Have you. <br/>
no fear of God that you treat this poor fellow like this? How long is it to <br/>
go on?’ He replied, ‘You are the one who corrupted him, so save him from <br/>
his plight that you see.’ ‘I will do so,’ said Abu Bakr; ‘I have got a black <br/>
slave, tougher and stronger than he, who is a heathen. I will exchange him <br/>
for Bilal.’ The transaction was carried out, and Abu Bakr took him and </p>
<p>Before he migrated to Medina he freed six slaves in Islam, Bilal being the <br/>
seventh, namely: 'Amir b. Fuhayra, who was present at Badr and Uhud <br/>
206 and was killed at the battle of Bi’r Ma'una; and Umm ‘Ubays and Zmnira <br/>
(she lost her sight when he freed her and Quraysh said, Al-Lat and a - <br/>
'Uzza are the ones that have taken away her sight’; but she said, By the <br/>
house of God, you lie. Al-Lat and al-'Uzza can neither harm nor heal, <br/>
so God restored her sight). </p>
<p>And he freed al-Nahdiya and her daughter who belonged to a woman ot <br/>
B. ‘Abdu’l-Dar; he passed by them when their mistress had sent them <br/>
about some flour of hers, and she was saying, ‘By God, I will never free <br/>
you ’ Abu Bakr said, ‘Free yourself from your oath.’ She said, It is tree; <br/>
you corrupted them so you free them.’ They agreed upon the price, and he <br/>
said, ‘I will take them and they are free. Return her flour to her. i ey <br/>
said, ‘Oughtn’t we to finish the grinding and then take it back to her' </p>
<p>He said, ‘Yes, if you like.’ „ 1 </p>
<p>He passed by a slave girl of B. Mu’ammil, a clan of B. Adiy b. Ka b who <br/>
was a Muslim. 'Umar b. a!-Khattab was punishing her to make her give <br/>
up Islam. At that time he was a polytheist. He beat her until he was tired <br/>
and said, ‘I have only stopped beating you because I am tired. bhe s f ,d » <br/>
‘May God treat you in the same way.’ Abu Bakr bought her and freed her. </p>
<p>Muhammad b. 'Abdullah b. Abu ‘Atlq from 'Amir b. 'Abdullah b al- <br/>
Zubayr from one of his family told me: Abu Quhafa said to lus son Abu <br/>
Bakr, ‘My son, I see that you are freeing weak slaves. If you warn to o <br/>
what you are doing, why don’t you free powerful men who could defend <br/>
you and protect you ?’ He said, ‘I am only trying to do what I am attempting <br/>
for God’s sake.’ It is said that these verses came down in reference to him <br/>
and what his father said to him: ‘As to him who gives and fears God and <br/>
believes in goodness,’ up to the divine words, ‘none is rewarded by Go. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 145 </p>
<p>with favour but for seeking his Lord’s most sublime face and in the end he <br/>
will be satisfied .’ 1 </p>
<p>The B. Makhzum used to take out 'Ammar b. Yasir with his father and <br/>
mother, who were Muslims, in the heat of the day and expose them to the <br/>
heat of Mecca, and the Apostle passed by them and said, so I have heard, <br/>
‘Patience, O family of Yasir! Your meeting-place will be paradise.’ They <br/>
killed his mother, for she refused to abandon Islam. </p>
<p>It was that evil man Abu Jahl who stirred up the Meccans against them. <br/>
When he heard that a man had become a Muslim, if he w-as a man of <br/>
social importance and had relations to defend him, he reprimanded him and 207 <br/>
poured scorn on him, saying, ‘You have forsaken the religion of your father <br/>
who was better than you. We will declare you a blockhead and brand you <br/>
as a fool, and destroy your reputation.’ If he was a merchant he said, </p>
<p>‘We will boycott your goods and reduce you to beggary.’ If he w-as a <br/>
person of no social importance, he beat him and incited people against him. </p>
<p>Hakim b. Jubayr from Sa'Id b. Jubayr told me: ‘I said to 'Abdullah b. <br/>
'Abbas, “Were the polytheists treating them so badly that apostasy was <br/>
excusable?” “Yes, by God, they were,” he said, “they used to beat one of <br/>
them, depriving him of food and drink so that he could hardly sit upright <br/>
because of the violence they had used on him, so that in the end he would <br/>
do whatever they said.” If they said to him, “Are al-Lat and al-'Uzza <br/>
your gods and not Allah?” he would say, “Yes” to the point that if a <br/>
beetle passed by them they would say to him, “Is this beetle your God and <br/>
not Allah ?” he would say yes, in order to escape from the suffering he was <br/>
enduring.’ </p>
<p>Al-Zubayr b. 'Ukasha b. 'Abdullah b. Abu Ahmad told me that he was <br/>
told that some men of B. Makhzum went to Hisham b. al-Walld w r hen his <br/>
brother al-Walld b. al-Walld became a Muslim. They had agreed to seize <br/>
some young men w-ho had become Muslims, among whom vvere Salma b. <br/>
Hisham and 'Ayyash b. Abu Rabl'a. They were afraid of his violent <br/>
temper and so they said, ‘We wish to'admonish these men because of this <br/>
religion which they have newly introduced; thus we shall be safe in the <br/>
case of others.’ ‘All right,’ he said, ‘admonish him, but bew r are that you <br/>
do not kill him.’ Then he began to recite: </p>
<p>My brother 'Uyays shall not be killed, </p>
<p>Otherwise there will be war between us for ever. 2 </p>
<p>‘Be careful of his life, for I swear by God that if you kill him, I will kill the <br/>
noblest of you to the last man.’ They said, ‘God damn the man. After <br/>
what he has said who will want to-bring trouble on himself, for, by God, <br/>
if this man w-ere killed while in our hands the best of us would be killed to a <br/>
man.’ So they left him and withdrew-, and that was how God protected <br/>
him from them. </p>
<p>1 Sura 92. 5, </p>

pagan Arabs. </p>

<p>208 the FIRST MIGRATION TO ABYSSINIA </p>
<p>When the apostle saw the affliction of his companions and that though he <br/>
escaped it because of his standing with Allah and his uncle Abu Talib, <br/>
he could not protect them, he said to them: ‘If you were to go to Abyssinia <br/>
(it would be better for you), for the king will not tolerate injustice and it is a <br/>
friendly country, until such time as Allah shall relieve you from your <br/>
distress.’ Thereupon his companions went to Abyssinia, being afraid of <br/>
apostasy and fleeing to God with their religion. This was the first hijra <br/>
in Islam. </p>
<p>The first of the Muslims to go were: B. Umayya: . . .' 'Uthman b. <br/>

<p>THE QURAYSH SEND TO ABYSSINIA TO GET THE <br/>
EMIGRANTS RETURNED </p>
<p>When Quraysh saw that the prophet’s companions were safely ensconced <br/>
in Abyssinia and had found security there, they decided among themselves <br/>
to send two determined men of their number to the Negus to get them sent <br/>
back, so that they could seduce them from their religion and get them out of <br/>
the home in which they were living in peace. So they sent 'Abdullah b. <br/>
Abu Rabl'a and 'Amr b. al-'As b. Wa ll. They got together some presents <br/>
for them to take to the Negus and his generals. When Abu Talib perceived <br/>
their design he composed the following verse for the Negus to move him <br/>
to treat them kindly and protect them: </p>
<p>Would that I knew' how far-away Ja'far and 'Amr fare, </p>
<p>(The bitterest enemies are oft the nearest in blood). </p>
<p>Does the Negus still treat Ja'far and his companions kindly, </p>
<p>Or has the mischief-maker prevented him ? </p>
<p>Thou art noble and generous, mayst thou escape calamity; </p>
<p>No refugees are unhappy with thee. </p>
<p>Know that God has increased thy happiness <br/>
And all prosperity cleaves to thee. </p>
<p>Thou art a river whose banks overflow whth bounty <br/>
Which reaches both friend and foe. </p>
<p>Muhammad b. Muslim al-Zuhrl from Abu Bakr b. Abdu 1 -Rahman <br/>
b. al-Harith b. Hisham al-Makhzumf from Umm Salama d. Abu Umayya <br/>
b. al-Mughira wife of the apostle said, ‘When we reached Abyssinia the <br/>
Negus gave us a kind reception. We safely practised our religion, and we <br/>
worshipped God, and suffered no w'rong in word or deed. When the <br/>
8 Quraysh got to know’ of that, they decided to send two determined men to <br/>
the Negus and to give him presents of the choicest w^ares of Mecca. <br/>
Leatherwork w r as especially prized there, so they collected a great many </p>
<p>1 Again the reading and the meaning are in question. $arh means ‘castle’ or ‘room’ in </p>
<p>Eth. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 151 </p>
<p>skins so that they w’ere able to give some to every one of his generals. They <br/>
sent 'Abdullah and 'Amr with instructions to give each general his present <br/>
before they spoke to the Negus about the refugees. Then they were to <br/>
give their presents to the Negus and ask him to give the men up before he <br/>
spoke to them. They carried out these instructions to the letter, and said <br/>
to each of the generals, ‘Some foolish fellow’s from our people have taken <br/>
refuge in the king’s country. They have forsaken our religion and not <br/>
accepted yours, but have brought in an invented religion which neither <br/>
we nor you know anything about. Our nobles have sent us to the king to <br/>
get him to return them, so w’hen w T e speak to the king about them advise <br/>
him to surrender them to us and not to speak to them, for their own people <br/>
have the keenest insight and know most about their faults.’ This the <br/>
generals agreed to do. They took their gifts to the Negus and when he had <br/>
accepted them, they said to him w r hat they had already said to the generals <br/>
about the refugees. Now there w : as nothing which 'Abdullah and 'Amr <br/>
disliked more than that the Negus should hear what the Muslims had to <br/>
say. The generals about his presence said that the men had spoken truly, <br/>
and their own people best knew the truth about the refugees, and they <br/>
recommended the king to give them up and return them to their own people. </p>
<p>The Negus was enraged and said, ‘No, by God, I will not surrender them. 219 <br/>
No people who have sought my protection, settled in my country, and <br/>
chosen me rather than others shall be betrayed, until I summon them and <br/>
ask them about what these tw r o men allege. If they are as they say, I will <br/>
give them up to them and send them back to their own people; but if what <br/>
they say is false, I will protect them and see that they receive proper <br/>
hospitality while under my protection.’ </p>
<p>Then he summoned the apostle’s companions, and when his messenger <br/>
came they gathered together, saying one to another, ‘What will you say to <br/>
the man when you come to him?’ They said, ‘We shall say w’hat we know <br/>
and W'hat our prophet commanded us, come what may.’ When they came <br/>
into the royal presence they found that the king had summoned his bishops <br/>
with their sacred books exposed around him. He asked them what w'as <br/>
the religion for which they had forsaken their people, without entering into <br/>
his religion or any other. Ja'far b. Abu Talib answered, ‘O King, w r e were <br/>
an uncivilized people, worshipping idols, eating corpses, committing <br/>
abominations, breaking natural ties, treating guests badly, and our strong <br/>
devoured our w r eak. Thus w r e were until God sent us an apostle whose <br/>
lineage, truth, trustworthiness, and clemency w'e know'. He summoned us <br/>
to acknowledge God’s unity and to worship him and to renounce the <br/>
stones and images w'hich w r e and our fathers formerly worshipped. He <br/>
commanded us to speak the truth, be faithful to our engagements, mindful <br/>
of the ties of kinship and kindly hospitality, and to refrain from crimes and <br/>
bloodshed. He forbade us to commit abominations and to speak lies, and to <br/>
devour the property of orphans, to vilify chaste women. He commanded <br/>
us to worship God alone and not to associate anything with Him, and he </p>
<p>152 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>gave us orders about prayer, almsgiving, and fasting (enumerating the <br/>
commands of Islam). We confessed his truth and believed in him, and we <br/>
followed him in what he had brought from God, and we worshipped God <br/>
alone without associating aught with Him. We treated as forbidden what <br/>
he forbade, and as lawful what he declared lawful. Thereupon our people <br/>
attacked us, treated us harshly and seduced us from our faith to try to make </p>
<p>220 us.go back to the worship of idols instead of the worship of God, and to <br/>
regard as lawful the evil deeds we once committed. So when they got the <br/>
better of us, treated us unjustly and circumscribed our lives, and came <br/>
between us and our religion, we came to your country, having chosen <br/>
you above all others. Here we have been happy in your protection, and we <br/>
hope that we shall not be treated unjustly while we are with you, O King.’ </p>
<p>The Negus asked if they had with them anything which had come from <br/>
God. When Ja'far said that he had, the Negus commanded him to read it <br/>
to him, so he read him a passage from (Sura) KHY'S. 1 The Negus wept <br/>
until his beard was wet and the bishops wept until their scrolls were wet, <br/>
when they heard what he read to them. Then the Negus said, ‘Of a truth, <br/>
this and what Jesus 2 brought have come from the same niche. You <br/>
two may go, for by God, I will never give them up to them and they shall <br/>
not be betrayed.’ </p>
<p>When the two had gone, 'Amr said, ‘Tomorrow I will tell him something <br/>
that will uproot them all.’ Abdullah, who was the more godfearing of them <br/>
in his attitude towards us, said, ‘Do not do it, for they are our kindred <br/>
though they have gone against us.’ He said, ‘By God, I will tell him that <br/>
they assert that Jesus, son of Mary, is a creature.’ 3 He went to him in the <br/>
morning and told him that they said a dreadful thing about Jesus, son of <br/>
Mary, and that he should send for them and ask them about it. He did so. <br/>
Nothing of the kind had happened to them before, and the people gathered <br/>
together asking one another what they should say about Jesus when they <br/>
were asked. They decided that they would say what God had said and what <br/>
the prophet had brought, come what may. So when they went into the <br/>
royal presence and the question was put to them, Ja'far answered, ‘We say <br/>
about him that which our prophet brought, saying, he is the slave of God, <br/>
and his apostle, and his spirit, and his word, which he cast into Mary the <br/>
blessed virgin.’ The Negus took a stick from the ground and said, ‘By </p>
<p>221 God, Jesus, son of Mary, does not exceed what you have said by the length <br/>
of this stick.' His generals round about him snorted when he said this, <br/>
and he said, ‘Though you snort, by God! Go, for you are safe in my <br/>
country.’ [Shuyum means al-aminunai ) 4 Then he repeated three times the <br/>
words, ‘He who curses you will be fined. Not for a mountain of gold would </p>

<p>The Life of Muhammad 153 </p>
<p>I allow a man of you to be hurt’ (199). Give them back their presents, for <br/>
I have no use for them. God took no bribe from me when He gave me <br/>
back my kingdom, that I should take a bribe for it, and God did not do <br/>
what men wanted against me, so why should I do what they want against <br/>
Him.’ So they left his presence, crestfallen, taking away their rejected <br/>
gifts, while we lived with him comfortably in the best security. </p>
<p>While we were living thus, a rebel arose to snatch his kingdom from him, <br/>
and I never knew us to be so sad as we were at that, in our anxiety lest this <br/>
fellow would get the better of the Negus, and that a man would arise who <br/>
did not know our case as the Negus did. He went out against him, and the <br/>
Nile lay between the two parties. The apostle’s companions called for a <br/>
man who would go to the battle and bring back news, and al-Zubayr b. <br/>
al-'Awwam volunteered. Now he was the youngest man we had.* We <br/>
inflated a waterskin and he put it under his chest, and swam across until <br/>
he reached that point of the Nile where the armies faced one another. Then <br/>
he went on until he met them. Meanwhile we prayed to God to give the <br/>
Negus victory over his enemy and to establish him in his own country; <br/>
and as we were doing so, waiting for what might happen, up came al-Zubayr <br/>
running, waving his clothes as he said, Hurrah, the Negus has conquered <br/>
and God has destroyed his enemies and established him in his land.’ <br/>
By God, I never knew us to be so happy before. The Negus came back <br/>
God having destroyed his enemy and established him in his country, and <br/>
the chiefs of the Abyssinians rallied to him. Meanwhile we lived in happiest <br/>
conditions until we came to the apostle of God in Mecca. </p>
<p>HOW THE NEGUS BECAME KING OF ABYSSINIA </p>
<p>Al-Zuhr! said: I told 'Urwa b. al-Zubayr the tradition of Abu Bakr b. <br/>
'Abdu’I-Rahman from Umm Salama the prophet’s wife and he said: ‘Do <br/>
you know what he meant when he said that God took no bribe from me when <br/>
He gave me back my kingdom that I should take a bribe for it, and God did <br/>
not do what men wanted against me so why should I do what they want <br/>
against Him ? When I said that I did not know, he said that ‘A’isha told <br/>
him that the father of the Negus was the king, and the Negus was his only <br/>
son. The Negus had an uncle who had twelve sons who were of the <br/>
Abyssinian royal house. The Abyssinians said among themselves, ‘It <br/>
would be a good thing if we were to kill the father of the Negus and make <br/>
his brother king, because he has no Bon but this youngster, while his <br/>
brother has twelve sons, so they can inherit the kingdom after him so that <br/>
the future of Abyssinia may be permanently secured.’ So they attacked <br/>
the Negus s father and killed him, making his brother king, and such was the <br/>
state of affairs for a considerable time. </p>
<p>The Negus grew up with his uncle, an intelligent and resolute young <br/>
man. He attained an ascendancy over his uncle to such a degree that when </p>
<p>154 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>the Abyssinians perceived how great his influence with the king was, they <br/>
began to fear lest he might gain the crown, and would then put them all to <br/>
death because he knew that they were the murderers of his father. Accord¬ <br/>
ingly they went to his uncle and said, ‘Either you must kill this young man <br/>
or you must exile him from among us, for we are in fear of our lives because <br/>
of him.’ He replied, ‘You wretches, but yesterday I slew his father, and am <br/>
I to kill him today? But I will put him out of your country.’ So they took <br/>
him to the market and sold him to a merchant for six hundred dirhams. <br/>
The latter threw him into a boat and went off with him, but on that very <br/>
evening the autumn storm clouds massed, and his uncle went out to pray <br/>
for rain beneath the mass of cloud when he was struck by lightning and <br/>
killed. The Abyssinians hastened in fear to his sons, and lol he was a <br/>
begetter of fools; he had not a son w'ho was any good at all; the situation of <br/>
the Abyssinians became very unsettled, and when they feared the pressure <br/>
223 of events they said to one another, ‘Know, by God, that your king, the <br/>
only one who can put us to rights, is the one you sold this morning, and if <br/>
you care about your country go after him now.* So they went out in search <br/>
of him and the man to whom they had sold him, until they overtook him <br/>
and took the Negus from him. They then brought him home, put the <br/>
crow r n on his head, made him sit upon the throne, and proclaimed him <br/>
king. </p>
<p>The merchant to whom they had sold him came and said, ‘Either you <br/>
give me my money or I shall tell him about this.’ They said, ‘We will not <br/>
give you a penny.’ He said, 'In that case, by God, I will.speak to him.’ <br/>
They said, ‘Well, there he is’; so he came and stood before him and said, <br/>
‘O King, I bought a young slave from people in the market for six hundred <br/>
dirhams. They gave me my slave and they took my money, yet when I had <br/>
gone off with my slave they overtook me and seized my slave and kept my <br/>
money.’ The Negus said, 4 You must either give him his money back or let <br/>
the young man place his hand in his, and let him take him where he wishes.’ <br/>
They replied, ‘No, but we wall give him his money.’ For this reason he <br/>
said the words in question. This was the first thing that was reported <br/>
about his firmness in his religion and his justice in judgement. </p>
<p>Yazld b. Ruman told me from 'Urwa b. al-Zubayr from 'A’isha that she <br/>
said: ‘When the Negus died it used to be said that a light was constantly <br/>
seen over his grave.’ </p>
<p>THE ABYSSINIANS REVOLT AGAINST THE NEGUS </p>
<p>Ja'far b. Muhammad told me on the authority of his father that the <br/>
Abyssinians assembled and said to the Negus, ‘You have left our religion’ <br/>
and they revolted against him. So he sent to Ja'far and his companions <br/>
and prepared ships for them, saying, ‘Embark in these and be ready. If <br/>
I am defeated, go where you please; if I am victorious, then stay where you </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad x - ^ </p>
<p>a /^-’ Then he took P a P er and wrote, ( H e testifies that there is no God but <br/>
Allah and that Muhammad is His slave and apostle; and he testifies that <br/>
Jesus Son of Mary, is His slave, His apostle, His spirit and His word <br/>
w ich He cast into Mary.’ Then he put it in his gown near the right <br/>
shoulder and went out to the Abyssinians, who were drawn up in array to <br/>
meet him., He said, ‘O people, have I not the best claim among you?’ 224 <br/>
Certainly,, they said. ‘And what do you think of my life among you?’ <br/>
Excellent.’ ‘Then what is your trouble?’ ‘You have forsaken our religion <br/>
and assert that Jesus is a slave.’ ‘Then what do you say about Jesus?’ ‘We <br/>
say that he is the Son of God.’ The Negus put his hand upon his breast <br/>
over his gown, (signifying), ‘He testifies that Jesus, the Son of Mary, was <br/>
no more than “this”.’ By this he meant what he had written, but they were <br/>
content and went away. News of this reached the prophet, and when the <br/>
Negus died he prayed over him and begged that his sins might be forgiven. </p>
<p>'UMAR ACCEPTS ISLAM </p>
<p>When'Amr and 'Abdullah came to the Quraysh, not having been able to <br/>
bring back the prophet’s companions and having received a sharp rebuff <br/>
from the Negus, and when 'Umar became a Muslim, he being a strong, <br/>
stubborn man whose proteges none dare attack, the prophet’s companions <br/>
were so fortified by him and Hamza that they got the upper hand of <br/>
Quraysh. 'Abdullah b. Mas ud used to say, ‘We could not pray at the <br/>
Ka ba until 'Umar became a Muslim, and then he fought the Quraysh <br/>
until he could pray there and we prayed with him.’ 'Umar became a <br/>
Muslim after the prophet’s companions had migrated to Abyssinia <br/>
Al-Bakka’i said: 1 </p>
<p>Mis'ar b. Kidam from Sa'd b. Ibrahim said that 'Abdullah b. Mas'ud <br/>
said: “Umar’s (conversion to) Islam was a victory; his migration to <br/>
Medina was a help ; and his government was a divine mercy. We could not <br/>
pray at the Ka ba until he became a Muslim, and when he did so he fought <br/>
the Quraysh until he could pray there and we joined him.’ </p>
<p>'Abdu’l-Rahman b. al-Harith b. 'Abdullah b. 'Ayyash b. Abu Rabi'a </p>
<p>b - 'Abdullah b. 'Amir b. Rabi'a from his mother Umm 225 <br/>
Abdullah d. Abu Hathma who said: ‘We were on the point of setting out <br/>
or Abyssinia, and Amir had gone out for something we needed, when <br/>
Umar came and stopped beside me, he being a polytheist at the time and <br/>
we were receiving harsh treatment and affliction from him. He said’“So <br/>
youareoff, O mother of 'Abdullah.” “Yes,”Isaid, “we arc going to God’s <br/>
country. You have violently ill-treated us until God has given us a way <br/>
out. He said, “God be with you,” and I saw in him a compassion which <br/>
I had never seen before^ Then he went away, and I could see plainly that <br/>
our departure pained him; and when 'Amir came back with the thing </p>
<p>said’™ 5 indiCatCS thC recension of U- which I.H. used. Other MSS. read ‘Ibn Hisham </p>
<p>j 56 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>he needed I said to him, “0 father of 'Abdullah, I wish you had seen Umar <br/>
just now and the compassion and sorrow he showed on our account. <br/>
When he asked me if I had hopes of his becoming a Muslim, I replied <br/>
that I had, to which he answered, “The man you saw will not become a <br/>
Muslim until al-Khattab’s donkey does.” This he said in despair of him <br/>
because of his harshness and severity against Islam. </p>
<p>The Islam of 'Umar, so I have heard, was on this wise. His sister was <br/>
Fatima d. al-Khattab, and was married to Sa'Id b. Zayd b. 'Amr b. Nufayl, <br/>
both of whom had become Muslims and concealed the fact from 'Umar. <br/>
Now Nu'aym b. 'Abdullah al-Nahham, a man of his tribe from B. 'Adly <br/>
b. Ka'b, had become a Muslim and he also concealed the fact out of fear <br/>
of his people. Khabbab b. al-Aratt used often to come to Fatima to read <br/>
the Quran to her. One day 'Umar came out, girt with his sword, making for <br/>
the apostle, and a number of his companions, who he had been informed <br/>
had gathered in a house at al-Safa, in all about forty, including women. <br/>
With the apostle was his uncle Hamza, and AbQ Bakr, and All, from among <br/>
the Muslims who stayed with the apostle and had not gone out with those <br/>
who went to Abyssinia. Nu'aym met him and asked him where he was <br/>
going. 'I am making for Muhammad, the apostate, who has split up the <br/>
Quraysh, made mockery of their traditions, insulted their faith and their <br/>
226 gods, to kill him.’ ‘You deceive yourself, 'Umar, 1 he answered, ‘do you <br/>
suppose that B. 'Abdu Manaf will allow you to continue walking upon the <br/>
earth when you have killed Muhammad? Had not you better go back to <br/>
your own family and set their affairs in order ? W hat is the matter with my <br/>
family?’ he said. ‘Your brother-in-law, your nephew Sa'Id, and your sister <br/>
Fatima, have both become Muslims and followed Muhammad in his <br/>
religion, so you had better go and deal with them.’ Thereupon 'Umar <br/>
returned to his sister and brother-in-law at the time when Khabbab <br/>
was with them with the manuscript of Ta Ha, which he was reading to <br/>
them. When they heard 'Umar’s voice Khabbab hid in a small room, or in <br/>
a part of the house, and Fatima took the page and put it under her thigh. <br/>
Now 'Umar had heard the reading of Khabbab as he came near the house, <br/>
so when he came in he said, ‘What is this balderdash I heard? You have <br/>
not heard anything,’ they answered. ‘By God, I have,’ he said, ‘and I have <br/>
been told that you have followed Muhammad in his religion; and he <br/>
seized his brother-in-law Sa'Id, and his sister Fatima rose in defence of her <br/>
husband, and he hit her and wounded her. When he did that they said to <br/>
him, ‘Yes, we are Muslims, and we believe in God and His apostle, and <br/>
you can do what you like.’ When 'Umar saw the blood on his sister he <br/>
was sorry for what he had done and turned back and said to his sister, <br/>
‘Give me this sheet which I heard you reading just now so that I may see <br/>
just what it is which Muhammad has brought,’ for 'Umar could write. <br/>
When he said that, his sister replied that she was afraid to trust him with it. <br/>
‘Do not be afraid,* he said, and he swore by his gods that he would return <br/>
it when he had read it. When he said that, she had hopes that he would </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 157 </p>
<p>become a Muslim, and said to him, ‘My brother, you are unclean in your <br/>
polytheism and only the clean may touch it.’ So 'Umar rose and washed <br/>
himself and she gave him the page in which was Ta Ha, and when he had <br/>
read the beginning he said, ‘How fine and noble is this speech.’ When <br/>
he heard that, Khabbab emerged and said, ‘O 'Umar, by God, I hope that <br/>
God has singled you out by His prophet’s call, for but last night I heard <br/>
him saying, “O God, strengthen Islam by Abu’l-Hakam b. Hisham or by <br/>
'Umar b. al-Khattab.’’ Come to God, come to God, O 'Umar.’ At that 227 <br/>
'Umar said, ‘Lead me to Muhammad so that I may accept Islam.<em> Khab¬ <br/>
bab replied that he was in a house at al-Safa with a number of his com¬ <br/>
panions. So 'Umar took his sword and girt it on, and made for the apostle <br/>
and his companions, and knocked on the door. When they heard his <br/>
voice one of the companions got up and looked through a chink in the door, <br/>
and when he saw' him girt with his sword, he went back to the apostle in <br/>
fear, and said, ‘It is 'Umar with his sw'ord on.’ Hamza said, ‘Let him in; if <br/>
he has come wfith peaceful intent, we w T ill treat him well; if he has come with <br/>
ill intent, W'e will kill him w'ith his own sw'ord.’ The apostle gave the word <br/>
and he was let in. The apostle rose and met him in the room, seized him <br/>
round the girdle or by the middle of bis cloak, and dragged him along <br/>
violently, saying, ‘What has brought you, son of Khattab, for by God, I do <br/>
not think you will cease (your persecution) until God brings calamity <br/>
upon you.</em> 'Limar replied, ‘O Apostle of God, I have come to you to <br/>
believe in God and His apostle and what he has brought from God.’ The <br/>
apostle gave thanks to God so loudly that the w'hole household knew that <br/>
'Umar had become a Muslim. </p>
<p>The companions dispersed, having become confident when both 'Umar <br/>
and Hamza had accepted Islam because they knew that they W'ould protect <br/>
the apostle, and that they would get justice from their enemies through <br/>
them. This is the story of the narrators among the people of Medina about <br/>
'Umar’s Islam. </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. Abu Najlh, the Meccan, from his companions 'Ata* and <br/>
Mujahid, or other narrators, said that 'Umar’s conversion, according to <br/>
what he used to say himself, happened thus: ‘I was far from Islam. I was a <br/>
winebibber in the heathen period, used to love it and rejoice in it. We <br/>
used to have a meeting-place in al-Hazwara at which Quraysh used to <br/>
gather 1 near the houses of the family of 'Umar b. 'Abd b. 'Imran al- 228 <br/>
Makhzuml. I went out one night, making for my boon companions in <br/>
that gathering, but when I got there, there w'as no one present, so I <br/>
thought it would be a good thing if I went to so-and-so, the wineseller, who <br/>
was selling wine in Mecca at the time, in the hope that I might get some¬ <br/>
thing to drink from him, but I could not find him either, so I thought it <br/>
would be a good thing if I went round the Ka'ba seven or seventy times. </p>
<p>So I came to the mosque meaning to go round the Ka'ba and there was the <br/>
apostle standing praying. As he prayed he faced Syria, putting the Ka'ba </p>
<p>1 It was the market of Mecca. </p>
<p>158 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>between himself and Syria. His stance was between the black stone and <br/>
the southern corner. When I saw him I thought it would be a good <br/>
thing if I could listen to Muhammad so as to hear what he said. If I came <br/>
near to listen to him I should scare him, so I came from the direction of the <br/>
hijr and got underneath its coverings and began to walk gently. Meanwhile <br/>
the prophet was standing in prayer reciting the Quran until I stood in his <br/>
qihla facing him, there being nothing between us but the covering of the <br/>
Ka'ba. When I heard the Quran my heart was softened and I wept, and <br/>
Islam entered into me; but I ceased not to stand in my place until the <br/>
apostle had finished his prayer. Then he went away. When he went <br/>
away he used to go past the house of the son of Abu Husayn, which was <br/>
on his way, so that he crossed the path where the pilgrims run. Then he <br/>
went between the house of 'Abbas and Ibn Azhar b. 'Abdu 'Auf al-Ztihri; <br/>
then by the house of Al-Akhnas b. Shariq until he entered his own house. <br/>
His dwelling was in al-Dar al-Raqta’, which was in the hands of Mu'awiya <br/>
b. Abu Sufyan. I continued to follow him, until when he got between the <br/>
house of 'Abbas and Ibn Azhar I overtook him, and when he heard my <br/>
voice he recognized me and supposed that I had followed him only to <br/>
ill-treat him, so he repelled me, saying, “What has brought you at this <br/>
hour?” I replied that I had come to believe in God and His apostle and <br/>
what he had brought from God. He gave thanks to God and said, “God <br/>
229 has guided you.” Then he rubbed my breast and prayed that I might be <br/>
steadfast. Afterwards I left him. He went into his house.’ But God knows <br/>
what the truth was. </p>
<p>Nafi' freedman of 'Abdullah b. 'Umar on the authority of Ibn 'Umar <br/>
said: When my father 'Umar became a Muslim he said, ‘Which of the <br/>
Quraysh is best at spreading reports?’ and was told that it was Jamil b. <br/>
Ma'mar al-Jumahl. So he went to him, and I foliowed after to see w T hat he <br/>
was doing, for although I was very young at the time I understood every¬ <br/>
thing I saw. He went to Jamil and asked him if he knew that he had become <br/>
a Muslim and entered into Muhammad’s religion; and, by God, hardly <br/>
had he spoken to him when he got up dragging his cloak on the ground as <br/>
'Umar followed him and I followed my father, until he stood by the door <br/>
of the mosque and cried at the top of his voice while the Quraysh were in <br/>
their meeting-places roupd the Ka'ba, “Umar has apostatized,’ while <br/>
'Umar behind him shouted, ‘He is a liar; but I have become a Muslim <br/>
and I testify that there is no God but Allah and Muhammad is His servant <br/>
and apostle.’ They got up to attack him and fighting went on between <br/>
them until the sun stood over their heads, and he became w r eary and sat <br/>
dowm while they stood over him, as he said, ‘Do as you will, for I swear by <br/>
God that if we were three hundred men we would have fought it out on <br/>
equal terms.’ At this point a shaykh of the Quraysh, in a Yamanl robe and <br/>
an embroidered shirt, came up and stopped and inquired what was the <br/>
matter. When he was told that 'Umar had apostatized he said, ‘Why should <br/>
not a man choose a religion for himself, and what are you trying to do ? Do </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>you think that B. 'Adiy will surrender their companion to you thus? Let the <br/>
man alone.’ By God, it was as though they were a garment stripped off him 1 <br/>
After my father had migrated to Medina I asked him who the man was who <br/>
drove away the people on the day he became a Muslim while they were <br/>
fighting him, and he said, ‘That, my son, was al-'As b. Wa’il al-Sahml (200) ’ <br/>
Abdu 1 -Rahman b. al-Harith from one of 'Umar’s clan or one of his z 3 o <br/>
amily said that Umar said, ‘When I became a Muslim that night I thought <br/>
o the man who was the most violent in enmity against the apostle so that <br/>
I might come and tell him that I had became a Muslim, and Abu Jahl <br/>
came to my mind.’ Now 'Umar’s mother was Hantama d. Hisham b al- <br/>
M S a - m tbe corning I knocked on his door, and he came out and </p>
<p>m r l a beSt of welcomes &gt; n ephew, what has brought you?’ I answered <br/>
that I had come to tell him that I believed in God and His apostle Muham¬ <br/>
mad and regarded as true what he had brought. He slammed the door in <br/>
my face and said, ‘God damn you, and damn what you have brought.’ </p>
<p>tpie document proclaiming a boycott </p>
<p>When Quraysh perceived that the apostle’s companions had settled in a <br/>
and in peace and safety, and that the Negus had protected those who <br/>
sought refuge with him, and that 'Umar had become a Muslim and that <br/>
I:Ia / n ^ a u were on the Slde of apostle and his companions, </p>
<p>, , d ? , Is ! am had b f gun to s P read am ong the tribes, they came together <br/>
and decided among themselves to write a document in which they should <br/>
put a boycott on B. Hashim and B. Muttalib that they should not marry </p>
<p>n VK W r e r n ° r f Ve W ° men t0 them t0 marr ^ and that they should <br/>
neither buy from them nor sell to them, and when they agreed on that they </p>
<p>wrote it m a deed Then they solemnly agreed on the points and hung the </p>
<p>deed up in the middle of the Ka'ba to remind them of their obligatLs. </p>
<p>, AhH W M er K h ^A d u? 7 ^ Man ? Qr b- 'Ikrima b. 'Amir b. Hashim b. </p>
<p>u Manaf b. Abdu 1 -Dar b. Qusayy (201) and the apostle invoked <br/>
God against him and some of his fingers withered. </p>

Ahr i A^Ja 1 -. ^ emered Wlth him int0 his alle y and i° ined him. </p>
<p>Abu Lahab Abdu I- Uzza went out from B. Hashim and helped Quraysh. 23 &lt; <br/>
Husayn b. Abdullah told me that Abu Lahab met Hind d 'Utba when <br/>
T C , a P eo P le ^d joined Quraysh against them, and he said, ‘Haven’t </p>
<p>elped al-Lat and al-'Uzza and haven’t I abandoned those who have <br/>
a andoned them and assisted their opponents?’ She said, ‘Yes, and may <br/>
God reward you well, O Abu 'Utba.’ And I was told that among the <br/>
ings that he said were, ‘Muhammad promises me things which 1 do not </p>
<p>mv h H T u ‘ v % WiH happCn aftCr m &gt;' death &gt; wh at has he put in <br/>
my hands after that?’ Then he blew on his hands and said, ‘May you </p>
<p>p ish. I can see nothing in you of the things which Muhammad says.’ </p>
<p>1 i.e. ‘a fear removed’. </p>
<p>160 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>So God revealed concerning him the words, ‘Abu Lahab and his hands <br/>
God blast (202).’ 1 </p>
<p>When Quraysh had agreed on this and had done what has just been <br/>
described, Abu Talib said: </p>
<p>Tell Lu’ayy, especially Lu’ayy of the Banu Ka'b, </p>
<p>News of our condition. </p>
<p>Did you not know that we have found Muhammad, </p>
<p>A prophet like Moses described in the oldest books, </p>
<p>And that love is bestowed on him (alone) of mankind </p>
<p>And that none is better than he whom God has singled out in love, </p>
<p>And that the writing you have fixed </p>
<p>Will be a calamity like the cry of the hamstrung camel ? 2 </p>
<p>Awake, awake before the grave is dug </p>
<p>And the blameless and the guilty are as one. </p>
<p>Follow not the slanderers, nor sever <br/>
The bonds of love and kinship between us. </p>
<p>Do not provoke a long-drawn-out war, </p>
<p>Often he who brings on war tastes its bitterness. </p>
<p>By the Lord of the temple we will not give up Ahmad, </p>
<p>To harsh misfortunes and times’ troubles, </p>
<p>232 Before hands and necks, yours and ours, </p>
<p>Are cut by the gleaming blades of Qusas 3 </p>
<p>In a close-hemmed battlefield where you see broken spears </p>
<p>And black-headed vultures circling round like a thirsty crowd. </p>
<p>The galloping of the horses about the scene <br/>
And the shout of warriors are like a raging battle. </p>
<p>Did not our father Hashim gird up his loins <br/>
And teach his sons the sword and spear ? </p>
<p>We do not tire of war until it tires of us; </p>
<p>We do not complain of misfortune when it comes. </p>
<p>We keep our heads and our valour <br/>
When the bravest lose heart in terror. </p>
<p>They remained thus for two or three years until they were exhausted, <br/>
nothing reaching them except what came froth their friends unknown to <br/>
Quraysh. </p>
<p>Abu Jahl, so they say, met Hakim b. Hizam b. Khuwaylid b. Asad with <br/>
whom was a slave carrying flour intended for his aunt Khadlja, the pro¬ <br/>
phet’s wife, who was with him in the alley. He hung on to him and said, <br/>
‘Are you taking food to the B. Hashim? By God, before you and your food <br/>
move from here I will denounce you in Mecca.’ Abu’l-Bakhtarl came to <br/>
him and said, ‘What is going on between you two?’ When he said that <br/>
Hakim was taking food to the B. Hashim, he said: ‘It is food he has which </p>
<p>1 Sura hi. 2 An allusion to the camel of Sjalth in Sura 26. 142. </p>
<p>3 Qusas is said to be a mountain of B. Asad containing iron mines. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad j 5 x </p>
<p>belongs to his aunt and she has sent to him about it. Are you trying to <br/>
prevent him taking her own food to her? Let the man go his way!’ Abu <br/>
Jahl refused until they came to blows, and AbQ’l-Bakhtari took a'camel’s <br/>
jaw and knocked him down, wounded him, and trod on him violently <br/>
while Hamza was looking on near by. They did not wish the apostle and <br/>
his companions to hear this news 'and rejoice over their discomfiture. <br/>
Meanwhile the apostle was exhorting his people night and day, secretly and <br/>
publicly, openly proclaiming God’s command without fear of anyone. </p>
<p>THE ILL-TREATMENT THE APOSTLE RECEIVED FROM <br/>
HIS PEOPLE </p>
<p>His uncle and the rest of B. Hashim gathered round him and protected <br/>
him from the attacks of the Quraysh, who, when they saw that they could 233 <br/>
not get at him, mocked and laughed at him and disputed with him. The <br/>
Quran began to come down concerning the wickedness of Quraysh and <br/>
those who showed enmity to him, some by name and some only referred <br/>
to in general. Of those named are his uncle Abu Lahab and his wife Umm <br/>
Jamil, the bearer of the wood’. God called her this because she, so I am <br/>
told, earned thorns and cast them in the apostle’s way where he would be <br/>
passing, bo God sent down concerning the pair of them; </p>
<p>Abu Lahab and his hands, God blast, </p>
<p>His wealth and gains useless at the last, </p>
<p>He shall roast in flames, held fast, </p>
<p>W ith his wife, the bearer of the wood, aghast, </p>
<p>On her neck a rope of palm-fibre cast. (20^) ! </p>
<p>I was told that Umm Jamil, the bearer of the wood, when she heard what <br/>
had come down about her and about her husband in the Quran, came to <br/>
the aposde of God, when he was sitting in the mosque by the Ka’ba with <br/>
Abu Bakr, with a stone pestle in her hand, and when she stood by the <br/>
pair of them God made her unable to see the apostle so that she saw only </p>
<p>., , U ^ akr ant - aSked him where hls com P an ion was, ‘for I have been told <br/>
that he is1 satirizing me, 2 and by God, if I had found him I would have <br/>
smashed his mouth with this stone. By God, I am a poet.’ Then she said; </p>
<p>We reject the reprobate, </p>
<p>His words we repudiate, </p>
<p>His religion we loathe and hate. 3 </p>

<p>r 6 2 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>234 Then she went off and Abu Bakr asked the apostle if he thought she had <br/>
seen him. He replied that she had not because God had taken her sight <br/>
away from him (204). </p>
<p>The Quraysh had called the apostle Mudhammam to revile him. He <br/>
used to say, ‘Aren’t you surprised at the injuries of the Quraysh which God <br/>
turns away from me ? They curse me and satirize Mudhammam [reprobate] <br/>
whereas I am Muhammad [the laudable].’ </p>
<p>[Another referred to in the Quran] is Umayya b. Khalaf b. Wahb b. <br/>
Hudhafa b. Jumah. Whenever he saw the apostle he slandered and <br/>
reviled him, so God sent down concerning him, ‘Woe to every slandering <br/>
backbiter, who has gathered wealth and increased it, and thinks that his <br/>
wealth will make him immortal. No, he will be thrown to the devouring <br/>
fire. What will make you realize what that is ? It is God’s fire kindled which <br/>
mounts over the hearts. It is shut in on them in wide columns (205).’ 1 </p>
<p>Khabbab b. al-Aratt, the prophet’s companion, was a smith in Mecca <br/>
who used to make swords. He sold some to al-'As b. Wa’il so that he owed <br/>
him some money and he came to him to demand payment. He answered, <br/>
‘Does not Muhammad, your companion whose religion you follow, allege <br/>
that in Paradise there is all the gold and silver and clothes and servants that </p>
<p>235 his people can desire?’ ‘Certainly,’said Khabbab. ‘Then give me till the <br/>
day of resurrection until I return to that house and pay your debt there; for <br/>
by God, you and your companion will be no more influential with God <br/>
than I, and have no greater share in it.’ So God revealed concerning him, <br/>
‘Have*you considered him who disbelieves Our signs and says, I shall be <br/>
given wealth and children. Hath he studied the unseen ?’ so far as the <br/>
words, ‘and we shall inherit from him what he speaks of and he will come </p>
<p>to us alone.’ 2 „ . </p>
<p>Abu Jahl met the apostle, so I have heard, and said to him, fly t^oU, <br/>
Muhammad, you will either stop cursing our gods or we will curse the <br/>
God you serve.’ So God revealed concerning that, ‘Curse not those to <br/>
whom they pray other than God lest they curse God wrongfully through <br/>
lack of knowledge.’ 3 I have been told that the apostle refrained from cursing <br/>
their gods, and began to call them to Allah. </p>
<p>Al-Nadr b. al-Harith b. 'Alqama b. Kalada b. 'Abdu Manaf whenever <br/>
the apostle sat in an assembly and invited people to God, and recited the <br/>
Quran, and warned the Quraysh of what had happened to former peoples, <br/>
followed him when he got up and spoke to them about Rustum the Hero <br/>
and Isfandivar and the kings of Persia, saying, ‘By God, Muhammad <br/>
cannot tell a better story than I and his talk is only of old fables which he <br/>
has copied 4 as I have.’ So God revealed concerning him, ‘And they say, <br/>
Stories of the ancients which he has copied down, and they are read to </p>
<p>■ Sura ,04. 2 SOra I9 ' 8o - </p>
<p>4 SCra 25. f.'iktataba means to write down oneself, or to get something written down by <br/>
another. The former seems to be demanded by the context. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 163 </p>
<p>him morning and night. Say, He who knows the secrets of heaven and <br/>
earth has sent it down. Verily, He is merciful, forgiving.’ 1 </p>
<p>And there came down concerning him, ‘When Our verses are read to <br/>
him he says, fables of the ancients’. 1 </p>
<p>And again, ‘Woe to every sinful liar who hears God’s verses read before <br/>
him. Then he continues in pride as though he had not heard them, as <br/>
though in his ears was deafness. Tell him about a painful punishment’ <br/>
(206). 2 </p>
<p>The apostle sat one day, so I have heard, with al-Walld b. al-Mughlra 236 <br/>
in the mosque, and al-Nadr b. al-Harith came and sat with them in the <br/>
assembly where some of Quraysh were. When the apostle spoke al-Nadr <br/>
interrupted him, and the apostle spoke to him until he silenced him. Then <br/>
he read to him and to the others: ‘Verily ye and what ye serve other than <br/>
God is the fuel of hell. You will come to it. If these had been gods they <br/>
would not have come to it, but all will be in it everlastingly. There is <br/>
wailing and there they will not hear’ (207). 3 </p>
<p>Then the apostle rose and ‘Abdullah b. al-Ziba'ra al-Sahml came and <br/>
sat down. Al-Walid said to him: ‘By God al-Nadr could not stand up to <br/>
the (grand)son of 'Abdu’l-Muttalib just now and Muhammad alleged <br/>
that we and our gods are fuel for hell.’ 'Abdullah said: 'If I had found <br/>
him I would have refuted him. Ask Muhammad, “Is everything which is <br/>
worshipped besides God in Gehenna with those who worship it ?” We <br/>
worship the angels; the Jew's worship 'Uzayr; and the Christians worship <br/>
Jesus Son of Mary.* Al-Walid and those with him in the assembly mar¬ <br/>
velled at 'Abdullah’s words and thought that he had argued convincingly. <br/>
When the apostle w r as told of this he said: ‘Everyone who wishes to be 2 37 <br/>
worshipped to the exclusion of God will be with those who worship him. <br/>
They worship only satans and those they have ordered to be worshipped.’ </p>
<p>So God revealed concerning that ‘Those who have received kindness from <br/>
us in the past will be removed far from it and will not hear its sound <br/>
and they abide eternally in their heart’s desire’, 4 i.e. Jesus Son of Mary and <br/>
‘Uzayr and those rabbis and monks who have lived in obedience to God, <br/>
whom the erring people w'orship as lords beside God. And He revealed <br/>
concerning their assertion that they worship angels and that they are the <br/>
daughters of God, ‘And they say the Merciful has chosen a son, (exalted <br/>
be He above this); nay, they are but honoured slaves, they do not speak <br/>
before He speaks, and they carry out His commands’, as far as the words, </p>
<p>‘and he of them who says, I am God as well as He, that one we shall repay <br/>
with Gehenna. Thus do they repay the sinful ones.’ 5 </p>
<p>And He revealed concerning what he mentioned about Jesus, Son of <br/>
Mary, that he was worshipped beside God, and the astonishment of al- <br/>
Walid and those who were present, at his argument and disputation, ‘And </p>
<p>1 Sura 83. 13. </p>
<p>3 Sura 2i. 98. </p>
<p>5 Sura 21. 26-30. </p>
<p>2 Sura 45. 7. </p>
<p>4 Sura ?,i. 101. </p>
<p>164 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>when Jesus, Son of Mary, was cited as an example thy people laughed <br/>
thereat’ / i.e. they rejected your attitude to what they say . 2 </p>
<p>Then He mentions Jesus, Son of Mary, and says, ‘He was nothing but a <br/>
slave to whom We showed favour and made him an example to the children <br/>
of Israel. If We had wished We could have made from you angels to act <br/>
as vice-regents in the earth. Verily, there is knowledge of the [last] hour, <br/>
so doubt not about it but follow Me. This is an upright path,’ i.e. the <br/>
signs which I gave him in raising the dead and healing the sick, therein is <br/>
sufficient proof of the knowledge of the hour. He says: ‘Doubt not about <br/>
it, but follow Me. This is an upright path.’ </p>
<p>Al-Akhnas b. Sharlq b. 'Amr b. Wahb al-Thaqafi, ally of B. Zuhra, was <br/>
one of the leaders of his people who was listened to with respect, and he <br/>
used to give the apostle much trouble and contradict him, so God sent <br/>
238 down about him: ‘Do not obey every feeble oath-taker, slanderer, walking <br/>
about with evil tales/ as far as the word 'zanim ? </p>
<p>He did not say zantm in the sense of ‘ignoble* to insult his ancestry, <br/>
because God does not insult anyone’s ancestry, but he confirmed thereby <br/>
the epithet given to him so that he might be known. Zantm means an <br/>
adopted member of the tribe. AI-Khatlm al-Tamimi said in pagan days: </p>
<p>An outsider whom men invite as a supernumerary <br/>
As the legs are useless additions to the width of a pelt. </p>
<p>Al-Walid said: ‘Does God send down revelations to Muhammad and <br/>
ignore me, the greatest chief of Quraysh, to say nothing of Abu Mas'ud <br/>
‘Amr b. ‘Umayr al-Thaqafi, the chief of Thaqlf, we being the great ones of <br/>
Ta’if and Mecca?’ So God sent down concerning him, so I am told, <br/>
‘They said, if this Quran had been revealed to a great man of the two towns,’ <br/>
as far as the words, ‘than what they amass ’. 4 </p>
<p>Ubayy b. Khalaf b. Wahb b. Hudhafa and <em>Uqba b. Abu Mu'ayJ were <br/>
very close friends. Now ‘Uqba had sat and listened to the apostle and when <br/>
Ubayy knew of that he came to him and said, ‘Do I hear that you have sat <br/>
with Muhammad and listened to him? I swear I will never see you or <br/>
speak to you again (and he swore a great oath) if you do the same again, <br/>
or if you do not go and spit in his face.</em> *Uqba, the enemy of God, actually <br/>
did this, God curse him. So God sent down concerning the pair of them, </p>
<p>1 Sura 43. 57. </p>
<p>1 A difficult phrase. $adda with the preposition min means ‘to laugh immoderately or to <br/>
make a loud noise’. With 'an it means ‘to turn away from’. But these t 4 vo prepositions are <br/>
often interchangeable. Ibn Ishaq’s explanation of the passage is that the fact that Christians <br/>
pray to Jesus is no justification for the polytheism of the Meccans, as the latter argued, for <br/>
Christians perverted the message Jesus brought. When Jesus is adduced as an example (of <br/>
one who called an evil people to God) the Meccans rejected Muhammad’s attitude towards <br/>
him in what they said; but this exegesis is not sound. The Sura is perfectly consistent in <br/>
showing how prophets were sent to erring peoples and were laughed at. Cf. v. 47: The <br/>
Meccans laugh when Jesus is mentioned because his worship would seem to justify their <br/>
worshipping several gods. The citation which follows shows where in Muhammad’s opinion <br/>
they were wrong. 1 . 1 . has adopted the reading yajudduna (so Nafi‘, I. ‘Amir, and al-KisS’i) <br/>
instead of the comnioner yafidduna. </p>
<p>3 Sura 68. 10-13. 4 Sura 43. 30. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad ^ </p>
<p>‘On the day that the sinner bites his hands, saying, would that I had chosen <br/>
a path with the apostle,’ as far as the words ‘a deserter of men’ 1 </p>
<p>Ubayy took to the apostle an old bone, crumbling to pieces," and said, <br/>
Muhammad, do you allege that God can revivify this after it has decayed ?’ <br/>
Then he crumbled it in his hand and blew the pieces in the apostle’s face. 210 <br/>
The apostle answered: ‘Yes, I do say that. God will raise it and you, after <br/>
you have become like this. Then God wall send you to Hell.’ So God <br/>
revealed concerning him, ‘He gave us a parable, and he forgot that he was <br/>
created, saying, who will revivify bones which are rotten ? Say, He who <br/>
gave them life m the first instance will revivify them. He who knows about <br/>
all creation, who has made for you fire from the green wood, and lo you <br/>
kindle flame from it.’ 2 3 </p>

reputation among their people. They said: ‘Muhammad, come let us <br/>
worship what you worship, and you worship what w’e worship You and <br/>
we will combine in the matter. If what you worship is better than what <br/>
we worship we will take a share of it, and if what we worship is better than <br/>
what you worship, you can take a share of that.’ So God revealed con¬ <br/>
cerning them, Say, O disbelievers, I do not worship what you worship <br/>
and you do not worship what I worship, and I do not worship what you <br/>
worship, and you do not worship what I worship; you have your religion <br/>
and I have mine,’ 4 i.e. If you will only worship God on condition that I <br/>
worship what you worship, I have no need of you at all. You can have your <br/>
rehgion, all of it, and I have mine. </p>
<p>(T. Now the apostle was anxious for the welfare of his people, wishing T. i <br/>
to attract them as far as he could. It has been mentioned that he longed for <br/>
a way to attract them, and the method he adopted is what Ibn Hamid told <br/>
me that Salama said M. b. Ishaq told him from Yazld b. Ziyad of Medina <br/>
from M b. Ka'b al-Qurazi: When the apostle saw that his people turned <br/>
their backs on him and he was pained by their estrangement from what he <br/>
brought them from God he longed that there should come to him from <br/>
God a message that would reconcile his people to him. Because of his <br/>
love for his people and his anxiety over them it would delight him if <br/>
the obstacle that made his task so difficult could be removed; so that <br/>
he meditated on the project and longed for it and it was dear to him. Then <br/>
God sent down ‘By the star when it sets your comrade errs not and is not <br/>
deceived, he speaks not from his own desire,’ and when he reached His <br/>
words Have you thought of al-Lat and al-'Uzza and Manat the third, the <br/>

Gharanlq 1 whose intercession is approved / 2 When Quraysh heard that, <br/>
they were delighted and greatly pleased at the way in which he spoke of <br/>
their gods and they listened to him; while the believers were holding that <br/>
what their prophet brought them from their Lord was true, not suspecting <br/>
a mistake or a vain desire or a slip, and when he reached the prostration 3 <br/>
and the end of the Sura in which he prostrated himself the Muslims <br/>
prostrated themselves when their prophet prostrated confirming what he <br/>
brought and obeying his command, and the polytheists of Quraysh and <br/>
others who were in the mosque prostrated when they heard the mention of <br/>
their gods, so that everyone in the mosque believer and unbeliever pro¬ <br/>
strated, except al-Walid b. al-Mughlra who was an old man who could not <br/>
do so, so he took a handful of dirt from the valley and bent over it. Then <br/>
the people dispersed and Quraysh went out, delighted at what had been <br/>
said about their gods, saying, ‘Muhammad has spoken of our gods in <br/>
splendid fashion. He alleged in what he read that they are the exalted <br/>
Gharinlq whose intercession is approved.’ </p>
<p>The news reached the prophet’s companions who were in Abyssinia, it <br/>
being reported that Quraysh had accepted Islam, so some men started to <br/>
return while others remained behind. Then Gabriel came to the apostle <br/>
and said, ‘What have you done, Muhammad? You have read to these <br/>
people something I did not bring you from God and you have said what <br/>
He did not say to you. The apostle was bitterly grieved and was greatly <br/>
in fear of God. So God sent down (a revelation), for He was merciful to <br/>
him, comforting him and making light of the affair and telling him. that <br/>
every prophet and apostle before him desired as he desired and wanted <br/>
what he wanted and Satan interjected something into his desires as he had <br/>
on his tongue. So God annulled what Satan had suggested and God <br/>
established His verses i.e. you are just like the prophets and apostles. Then <br/>
God sent down: ‘We have not sent a prophet or apostle before you but <br/>
when he longed Satan cast suggestions into his longing. But God will annul <br/>
what Satan has suggested. Then God will establish his verses, God being <br/>
knowing and Wise .’ 4 Thus God relieved his prophet’s grief, and made him <br/>
feel safe from his fears and annulled what Satan had suggested in the words <br/>
used above about their gods by his revelation ‘Are yours the males and His <br/>
the females? That were indeed an unfair division’ (i.e. most unjust); <br/>
‘they are nothing but names which your fathers gave them! as far as the <br/>
words ‘to whom he pleases and accepts ', 5 i.e. how can the intercession of <br/>
their gods avail with Him ? </p>
<p>When the annulment of what Satan had put uppn the prophet’s tongue </p>
<p>1 The word is said to mean ‘Numidian cranes’ which fly at a great height, </p>
<ul>
<li>Another reading is turtajd ‘to be hoped for’. </li>
</ul>
<p>3 Mentioned in the last verse of the Sura. </p>
<p>4 Sura 22. 51. The following verse is not without relevance in this context: ‘that He may <br/>
make what Satan suggested a temptation to those whose hearts are diseased and hardened’. </p>
<ul>
<li>Sura 53. 19-27. </li>
</ul>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 167 </p>
<p>came from God, Quraysh said: ‘Muhammad has repented of what he said <br/>
about the position of your gods with Allah, altered it and brought some¬ <br/>
thing else.’ Now those two words which Satan had put upon the apostle’s <br/>
tongue were in the mouth of every polytheist and they became more <br/>
violently hostile to the Muslims and the apostle’s followers. Meanwhile <br/>
those of his companions who had left Abyssinia when they heard that the <br/>
people of Mecca had accepted Islam when they prostrated themselves with <br/>
the apostle, heard when they approached Mecca that the report was false <br/>
and none came into the town without the promise of protection or secretly. </p>
<p>Of those who did come into Mecca and stayed there until he migrated to <br/>
Medina and were present at Badr with him was ‘Uthman b. 'Affan ... with <br/>
his wife Ruqayya d. of the apostle and Abu Hudhayfa b. 'Utba with his <br/>
wife Sahla d. of Suhayl, and a number of others, in all thirty-three men. 1 </p>
<p>Abu Jahl b. Hisham, when God mentioned the tree of al-Zaqqum to <br/>
strike terror into them, said: ‘O Quraysh, do you know what the tree of <br/>
al-Zaqqum with which Muhammad would scare you is?’ When they said <br/>
that they did not he said: ‘It is Yathrib dates buttered. By Allah, if we <br/>
get hold of them we will gulp them down in one!’ So God sent down con¬ <br/>
cerning him, ‘Verily the tree of al-Zaqqum is the food of the sinner like <br/>
molten brass seething in their bellies like boiling water,’ 2 i.e. it is not as he 240 <br/>
said (208). God revealed concerning it, ‘And the tree which is cursed in <br/>
the Quran; and We will frighten them, but it increases them in naught <br/>
save great wickedness.’ 3 </p>
<p>Al-Walid was having a long conversation with the apostle who greatly <br/>
desired to convert him to Islam when I, Umm Maktum, a blind man, <br/>
passed by and began to ask the apostle to recite the Quran. The prophet <br/>
found this hard to bear and it annoyed him, because he was diverting him <br/>
from al-Walid and spoiling the chance of his conversion; and when the <br/>
man became importunate he went off frowning and left him. So God <br/>
revealed concerning him, ‘He frowned and turned his back when the <br/>
blind man came to him’ as far as the words ‘in books honoured, exalted, <br/>
and purified’, 4 i.e. I sent you only to be an evangelist and a reprover; I did <br/>
not specify one person to the exclusion of another, so withhold not (the <br/>
message) from him who seeks it, and do not waste time over one w'ho does <br/>
not want it (209). </p>
<p>THE RETURN OF THOSE WHO HAD FLED TO ABYSSINIA 241 </p>
<p>The apostle’s companions who had gone to Abyssinia heard that the <br/>
Meccans had accepted Islam and they set out for the homeland. But wdien <br/>
they got near Mecca they learned that the report w r as false, so that they </p>

those who returned to him stayed in Mecca until they migrated to Medina <br/>

b. Abu Sarh b. Rabl'a b. Hilal. </p>
<p>The total number of his companions who came to Mecca from Abyssinia <br/>
was thirty-three men. The names given to us of those who entered under <br/>
promise of protection are ‘Uthman b. Maz'un protected by al-Walid b. <br/>
al-Mughlra; Abu Salama under the protection of Abu Talib who was his <br/>
uncle, Abu Salama’s mother being Barra d. 'Abdu’l-Muftalib. </p>
<p>'uthmAn b. maz'un renounces al-walId’s protection </p>
<p>Salih b. Ibrahim b. 'Abdu’I-Rahman b. ‘Auf told me from one who had <br/>
got it from 'Uthman saying: When 'Uthman b. Maz'un,saw the misery <br/>
in which the apostle’s companions were living while he lived night and <br/>
day under al-Walld’s protection he said, ‘It is more than I can bear that <br/>
I should be perfectly safe under the protection of a polytheist while my <br/>
friends and co-religionists are afflicted and distressed for God’s sake.’ </p>
<p>So he went to al-Walid and renounced his protection. ‘Why, nephew,’ <br/>
he asked, ‘Can it be that one of my people has injured you?’ ‘No,’ he <br/>
answered, ‘but I want to be under God’s protection: I don’t want to ask <br/>
for anyone else’s.’ Al-Walid asked him to come to the mosque and re¬ <br/>
nounce his protection publicly as he had given it publicly. When they got <br/>
there al-Walid said: “Uthman here has come to renounce my protection.’ <br/>
‘True,’ said the latter, ‘I have found him loyal and honourable in his <br/>
protection, but I don’t want to ask anyone but God for protection; so <br/>
I give him back his promise!’ So saying he went away. </p>
<p>[On another occasion when] Labld b. Rabl'a b. Malik b. Ja'far b. <br/>
Kilab was in an assembly of the Quraysh when 'Uthman was present he <br/>
recited a verse: </p>
<p>Everything but God is vain, </p>
<p>True! interjected 'Uthman; but when he went on: 244 </p>
<p>And everything lovely must inevitably cease, </p>
<p>'Uthman cried, ‘You lie! The joy of Paradise will never cease.’ Labld <br/>
said: ‘O men of Quraysh your friends never used to be annoyed thus. <br/>
Since when has this sort of thing happened among you.?’ One of the audience <br/>
answered: ‘This is one of those louts with Muhammad. They have aban¬ <br/>
doned our religion. Take no notice of what he says.’ 'Uthman objected <br/>
so energetically that the matter became serious. Whereupon that man rose <br/>
to his feet and hit him in the eye so that it became black. Now al-Walid </p>
<p>17° The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>was hard by watching what happened to 'Uthman and he said: ‘O nephew^ <br/>
your eye need not have suffered this had you remained in sure protection.’ <br/>
‘Uthman answered: ‘Nay by God my good eye needs what happened to <br/>
its fellow for God’s sake, and I am under the protection of One who is <br/>
stronger and more powerful than you, O Abu 'Abdu Shams.’ Al-WalTd <br/>
only said, ‘Come, nephew, my protection is always open to you,’ but he <br/>
declined it. </p>
<p>HOW ABO SALAMA FARED WITH HIS PROTECTOR </p>
<p>My father Ish§q b. Yasar on the authority of Salama b. 'Abdullah b. <br/>
'Umar b. Abu Salama told me that he told him that when Abu Salama had <br/>
asked Abu Talib’s protection some of the B. Makhzum went to him and <br/>
said: ‘You have protected your nephew Muhammad from us, but why are <br/>
you protecting our tribesman?’ He answered: ‘He asked my protection and <br/>
he is my sister’s son. If I did not protect my sister’s son I could not <br/>
protect my brother’s son.’ Thereupon Abu Lahab rose and said: ‘O <br/>
Quraysh, you have continually attacked this shaykh for giving his protec- <br/>
245 tion among his own people. By God, you must either stop this or we will <br/>
stand in with him until he gains his object.’ They said that they would <br/>
not do anything to annoy him, for he had aided and abetted them against <br/>
the apostle, and they wanted to keep his support. </p>
<p>Hearing him speak thus Abu TaBb hoped that he would support him <br/>
in protecting the apostle, and composed the following lines urging Abu <br/>
Lahab to help them both: </p>
<p>A man whose uncle is Abu 'Utayba </p>
<p>Is in a garden where he is free from violence. </p>
<p>I say to him (and how does such a man need my advice ?) </p>
<p>O Abu Mu'tib stand firm upright. </p>
<p>Never in your life adopt a course </p>
<p>For which you will be blamed when men meet together. </p>
<p>Leave the path of weakness to others, </p>
<p>For you were not bom to remain weak. </p>
<p>Fight! For war is fair; </p>
<p>You will never see a warrior humiliated till he surrenders. </p>
<p>How should you when they have done you no great injury <br/>
Nor abandoned you in the hour of victory or defeat? </p>
<p>God requite for us 'Abdu Shams and Naufal and Taym <br/>
And Makhzum for their desertion and wrong <br/>
In parting from us after affection and amity <br/>
So that they might get unlawful gains. </p>
<p>By God’s House you lie! Never will we abandon Muhammad <br/>
Before you see a dust-raising day in the shVb (210). 1 </p>
<p>1 This is the reading of Abd Dharr which seems to me superior to that of W. and C. <br/>
Qdtim means ‘a thick cloud of dust’ and implies men on the march. No satisfactory meaning </p>

<p>ABC BAKR ACCEPTS IBN AL-DUGHUNNA’S PROTECTION AND <br/>
THEN ABANDONS IT </p>
<p>Muhammad b. Muslim b. Shihab al-Zuhrl from 'Urwa frqpi 'A’isha <br/>
told me that when the situation in Mecca became serious and the apostle <br/>
and his companions suffered ill treatment from the Quraysh, Abu Bakr <br/>
asked the apostle’s permission to emigrate, and he agreed. So Abu Bakr <br/>
set forth and when he had gone a day or two’s journey from Mecca he fell <br/>
in with Ibn al-Dughunna, the brother of the B. Harith b. 'Abdu Man&amp;t <br/>
b. Kinana, who was at that time head of the Ahabish. (They were the B. <br/>
al-U 5 rith; and al-Hun b. Khuzayma b. Mudrika; and the B. al-Musfaliq <br/>
of Khuza'a.) (211.) </p>
<p>Replying to Ibn al-Dughunna’s inquiries Abu Bakr told him that his 246 <br/>
people had driven him out and ill-treated him. ‘But why,* he exclaimed, <br/>
‘when you are an ornament of the tribe, a standby in misfortune, always <br/>
kindly in supplying the wants of others? Come back with me under my <br/>
protection.’ So he went back with him and Ibn al-Dughunna publicly <br/>
proclaimed that he had taken him under his protection and none must <br/>
treat him other than well. </p>
<p>He continued: Abu Bakr had a mosque by the door of his house among <br/>
the B. Jumah where he used to pray. He was a tender-hearted man and <br/>
when he read the Quran 1 he was moved to tears. Youths, slaves, and women <br/>
used to stand by him astonished at his demeanour. Some men of Quraysh <br/>
went to Ibn al-Dughunna saying, ‘Have you given this fellow protection <br/>
so that he can injure us? Lo, he prays and reads what Muhammad has <br/>
produced and his heart becomes soft and he weeps. And he has a striking <br/>
appearance so that we fear he may seduce our youths and women and weak <br/>
ones. Go to him and tell him to go to his own house and do what he likes <br/>
there.’ So Ibn al-Dughunna went to him and said: ‘I did not give you <br/>
protection so that you might injure your people. They dislike the place <br/>
you have chosen and suffer hurt therefrom, so go into your house and do <br/>
what you like there.’ Abu Bakr asked him if he wanted him to renounce <br/>
his protection and when he said that he did he gave him back his guarantee. </p>
<p>Ibn al-Dughunna got up and told the Quraysh that Abu Bakr was no <br/>
longer under his protection and that they could do what they liked with him. </p>
<p>'Abdu’l-Rahm 5 n b. al-Qasim told me from his father al-Qasim b. <br/>
Muhammad that as Abu Bakr was going to the Ka'ba one of the loutish <br/>
fellows of Quraysh met him and threw dust on his head. Al-Walld b. <br/>
al-Mughlra, or it may have been al-'As b. W 5 ’il, passed him and he said, </p>
<p>can be given to qaim. Presumably ‘the shi'b of Abu 'J'alib, a defile of the mountains where <br/>
the projecting rocks of AbO Qubays pressed upon the eastern outskirts of the city. It was <br/>
entered from the town by a narrow alley closed by a low gateway through which a camel <br/>
could JJ^ss with difficulty. On all other sides it was detached by cliffs and buildings.* Muir, </p>
<p>The Lift of Muhammad, 93 f. </p>
<p>1 This statement implies that some at least of the Quran was written down before the <br/>
hijra. However, qara'a may not mean more than ‘recite*. </p>
<p>172 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>247 ‘Do you see what this lout has done to me?’ He replied, ‘You have done it <br/>
to yourself!’ Meanwhile he was saying three times ‘O Lord how long- <br/>
suffering Thou art!’ </p>
<p>THE ANNULLING OF THE BOYCOTT </p>
<p>The B. Hashim and the B. al-Muttalib were in the quarters which Quraysh <br/>
had agreed upon in the document they wrote, when a number of Quraysh <br/>
took steps to annul the boycott against them. None took more trouble in <br/>
this than Hisham b. 'Amr . . . for the reason that he was the son of a <br/>
brother to Nadia b. Hashim b. Abdu Manaf by his mother and was <br/>
closely attached to the B. Hashim. He was highly esteemed by his people. <br/>
I have heard that when these two clans were in their quarter he used to <br/>
bring a camel laden with food by night and then when he had got it to the <br/>
mouth of the alley he took off its halter, gave it a whack on the side, and <br/>
sent it into the alley to them. He would do the same thing another time, <br/>
bringing clothes for them. </p>
<p>He went to Zuhayr b. Abu Umayya b. al-Mughira whose mother was <br/>
'Atika d. 'Abdu’I-Muttalib and said: ‘Are you content to cat food and wear <br/>
clothes and marry women while you know of the condition of your maternal <br/>
uncles? They cannot buy or sell, marry, nor give in marriage. By God I <br/>
swear that if they were the uncles of Abu’l-Hakam b. Hisham and you <br/>
asked him to do what he has asked you to do he would never agree to it.’ <br/>
He said, ‘Confound you, Hisham, what can I do? I’m only one man. By </p>
<p>248 God if I had another man to back me I wuuld soon annul it.’ He said, <br/>
‘I have found a man. Myself.’ ‘Find another,’ said he. So Hisham went <br/>
to al-Mut'im b. 'Adiy and said, ‘Are you content that two clans of the B. <br/>
'Abdu Manaf should perish while you look on consenting to follow Quraysh ? <br/>
You will find that they will soon do the same with you.’ He made the same <br/>
reply as Zuhayr and demanded a fourth man, so Hisham went to Abu’l- <br/>
Bakhtari b. Hisham who asked for a fifth man, and then to Zama'a b. <br/>
al-Aswad b. al-Muttalib b. Asad and reminded him of their kinship <br/>
and duties. He asked whether others w r ere willing to co-operate in this <br/>
task and he gave him the names of the others. They all arranged to meet at <br/>
night on the nearest point of al-Hajun above Mecca, and there they bound <br/>
themselves to take up the question of the document until they had secured <br/>
its annulment. Zuhayr claimed the right to act and speak first. So on the <br/>
morrow when the people met together Zuhayr clad in a long robe went <br/>
round the Ka'ba seven times; then he came forward and said: ‘O people of <br/>
Mecca, are we to eat and clothe ourselves while the B. Hashim perish, <br/>
unable to buy or sell ? By God I will not sit down until this evil boycotting <br/>
document is torn up!’ Abu Jahl, who w r as at the side of the mosque, <br/>
exclaimed, ‘You lie by Allah. It shall not be torn up.’ Zama'a said, ‘You <br/>
are a greater liar; we w r ere not satisfied with the document when it was <br/>
written’. AbuTBakhtari said, 'Zama'a is right. We are not satisfied with </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 173 </p>
<p>what is written and we don’t hold with it.’ Al-Mut'im said, ‘You are both <br/>
right and anyone who says otherwise is a liar. We take Allah to witness that <br/>
we dissociate ourselves from the whole idea and what isw'ritten in the docu¬ <br/>
ment.’ Hisham spoke in the same sense. Abu Jahl said: ‘This is a matter 249 <br/>
which has been decided overnight. It has been discussed somewhere <br/>
else.’ Now Abu Talib was sitting at the side of the mosque. When al- <br/>
Mut'im went up to the document to tear it in pieces he found that worms <br/>
had already eaten it except the words ‘In Thy name O Allah’. (T. This T- 1198 <br/>
was the customary formula with which Quraysh began their writing.) </p>
<p>The writer of the deed was Mansur b. 'Ikrima. It is alleged that his hand <br/>
shrivelled (212). </p>
<p>When the deed was torn up and made of none effect Abu Talib com¬ <br/>
posed the following verses in praise of those who had taken part in the <br/>
annulment: </p>
<p>Has not our Lord’s doing come to the ears of those <br/>
Far distant across the sea 1 (for Allah is very kind to men), </p>
<p>Telling them that the deed was torn up </p>
<p>And all that was against God’s wish had been destroyed ? </p>
<p>Lies and sorcery were combined in it, </p>
<p>But sorcery never gets the upper hand. </p>
<p>Those not involved in it assembled together for it in a remote place 2 <br/>
While its bird of ill omen hovered within its head. 3 <br/>
It was such a heinous offence that it would be fitting <br/>
That because of it hands and necks should be severed <br/>
And that the people of Mecca should go forth and flee, </p>
<p>Their hearts quaking for fear of evil </p>
<p>And the ploughman be left in doubt what to do—■ </p>
<p>Whether to go down to the lowland or up to the hills— 250 </p>
<p>And an army come up between Mecca’s hills <br/>
Equipped with bows, arrows, and spears. </p>
<p>He of Mecca’s citizens whose power rises </p>
<p>(Let him know) that our glory in Mecca’s vale is older. </p>
<p>We grew up there when men were few </p>
<p>And have ever waxed great in honour and reputation. </p>
<p>We feed our guests till they leave a dish untasted </p>
<p>When the hands of the maysir players would begin to tremble. </p>
<p>God reward the people in al-Hajun who swore allegiance 4 </p>
<p>1 So the commentators, but an unnatural extension of the usual meaning of bahri is <br/>
 nvolved. </p>
<p>2 Commentators suggest as an alternative rendering ‘those who took it seriously’. Qarqar <br/>
means ‘flat soft ground’. </p>
<p>3 This seems to be an adaptation of Sura 17. 14: ‘We have fastened every man’s bird of <br/>
ill omen to his neck,’ Dr. Arafat suggests that the tair here means ‘ghost’, the bird which <br/>
emerges from the head of a murdered man, and the meaning would then be that the ghost <br/>
is fluttering within it before it finally emerges. </p>

found and there was no indication of his murderer. The relatives addressed the mountain <br/>
in the words just quoted which became a proverb. </p>

syntactically, though not metrically, a mistake for rabbahumd (instead of I.I.’s kilayhimd). is <br/>
right - ‘weep for the lord and master of the two sanctuaries’. Cf. Agh. xiii. 6, 1. 5 (cited by <br/>
Lammens, L'Arable occidental, Beirut, 1926, p. 146): ‘the hurrying between the two <br/>

<p>They keep their word and their protege lives securely. </p>
<p>AL-TUFAYL B. 'AMR AL-DAUSl ACCEPTS ISI-AM 252 </p>
<p>In spite of his people’s behaviour the apostle was continually giving them <br/>
good counsel and preaching salvation from their evil state. When God <br/>
protected him from them they began to warn all new-comers against him. </p>
<p>Al-Tufayl used to say that he came to Mecca when the apostle was there <br/>
and some of the Quraysh immediately camfe up to him. (He was a poet <br/>
of standing and an intelligent man.) They told him that this fellow had <br/>
done them much harm; had divided their community and broken up its <br/>
unity; ‘in fact he talks like a sorcerer separating a man from his father, his <br/>
brother, or his wife. We are afraid that he will have the same effect on you <br/>
and your people, so don’t speak to him or listen to a word from him.’ </p>
<p>They were so insistent that I decided not to listen to a word or to speak <br/>
to him and I went so far as to stuff cotton in my ears w r hen I went to the <br/>
mosque fearing that I might overhear a word or two against my will. <br/>
When I got to the mosque there was the apostle of God standing at prayer <br/>
by the Ka'ba, so I stood near him. God had decreed that I should hear <br/>
something of his speech and I heard a beautiful saying. So I said to myself, </p>
<p>‘God bless my soul! Here am I, an intelligent man, a poet, knowing per¬ <br/>
fectly well the difference between good and evil, so what is to prevent me <br/>
from listening to what this man is saying? If it is good I shall accept it; <br/>
if it is bad I shall reject it.’ </p>
<p>I stayed until the apostle went to his house and I followed him and </p>
<p>176 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>entered his house with him. I told him what his people had said and that <br/>
253 they had so scared me that I had stuffed cotton in my ears lest I should <br/>
hear what he was saying. But God had not allowed me to remain deaf <br/>
and I heard a beautiful saying. ‘So explain the matter to me/ I said. The <br/>
apostle explained Islam to me and recited the Quran to me. By God I <br/>
never heard anything finer nor anything more just. So I became a Muslim <br/>
and bore true witness. I said, ‘O prophet of God, I am a man of authority <br/>
among my people and when I go back and call them to Islam, pray to <br/>
God to give me a sign which will help me when I preach to them.’ He <br/>
said, ‘O God give him a sign.’ </p>
<p>So I went back to my people and when I came to the pass which would <br/>
bring me down to the settlement a light like a lamp played between my <br/>
eyes and I said, ‘O God, not in my face! for I fear that they will think <br/>
that a dire punishment has befallen my face because I have left their <br/>
religion.’ So the light moved and lighted on the top of my whip. The <br/>
people began to look at that light attached to my whip like a candle while <br/>
I was coming down from the pass to them. </p>
<p>When I got down my father came to me (he was a very old man) and <br/>
I said, ‘Be off with you, father, for I have nothing to do with you or you <br/>
with me!’ ‘But why, my son?’ said he. I said, ‘I have become a Muslim <br/>
and follow the religion of Muhammad.’ He said, ‘All right, my son, then <br/>
my religion is your religion.’ So I said, ‘Then go and wash yourself and <br/>
clean your clothes; then come and I will teach you what I have been taught.’ <br/>
He did so; I explained Islam to him and he became a Muslim. </p>
<p>Then my wife came to me and I said: ‘Be off with you, for I have nothing <br/>
to do with you or you with me’. ‘Why?’ she said, ‘my father and mother <br/>
be your ransom!’ I said, ‘Islam has divided us and I follow the religion <br/>
of Muhammad.’ She said, ‘Then my religion is your religion.’ I said, <br/>
‘Then go to the hind 1 (207) (temenos ?) of Dhu’l-Shara 2 and cleanse your¬ <br/>
self from it.’ Now Dhu’l-Shara was an image belonging to Daus and the <br/>
himd was the temenos which they had made sacred to him; in it there was a <br/>
trickle of water from a rivulet from the mountain. She asked me urgently, <br/>
‘Have you any fear from Dhu’l-Shara on my account?’ 3 ‘No,’ I said, ‘I <br/>
will go surety for that.’ So she went and washed and when she returned <br/>
254 I explained Islam to her and she became a Muslim. </p>
<p>Then I preached Islam to Daus but they held back, and I went to the <br/>
apostle in Mecca and said, ‘O prophet of God, frivolous preoccupation 4 <br/>
has been too much for me with Daus, so invoke a curse on them.’ But </p>
<p>1 No satisfactory explanation of this word is forthcoming, so probably we should adopt <br/>
Ibn Hisham's reading. </p>
<p>2 On Dhu’l-Shara (Dusares) see E.I. It is a title, not a name, of a god long associated <br/>
with the Nabataeans. In all probability the title is geographical, denoting ownership. More <br/>
cannot be safely said at present. </p>
<p>3 Or ‘on the children’s account’. </p>
<p>4 I have followed the commentators in taking a milder meaning than the ordinary' sense <br/>
which is ‘fornication’; if Dhu’l-Shara was an Arab Dionysos, the normal meaning would <br/>
not be out of place. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 177 </p>
<p>he said, ‘O God, guide Daus! Go back to your people and preach to them <br/>
gently.’ I continued in the Daus country calling them to Islam until the <br/>
apostle migrated to Medina and Badr, Uhud, and the Trench were passed. <br/>
Then I went to the apostle with my converts while he was in Khaybar. I <br/>
arrived at Medina with seventy or eighty households of Daus, and then we <br/>
joined the apostle in Khaybar and he gave us an equal share of the booty <br/>
with the Muslims. </p>
<p>I remained with the apostle until God opened Mecca to him and then <br/>
I asked him to send me to burn Dhu’l-Kaffayn, 1 the image of 'Amr b. <br/>
Humama. As he lit the fire he said: </p>
<p>Not of your servants am I, Dhu’l-Kaffayn, </p>
<p>Our birth is far more ancient than thine. </p>
<p>To stuff this fire in your heart I pine. </p>
<p>He- returned to Medina to the apostle and remained with him until <br/>
God took him. When the Arabs revolted he sided with the Muslims and <br/>
fought with them until they disposed of Tulayha and the whole of Najd. <br/>
Then he went with the Muslims to the Yamama with his son 'Amr, and <br/>
while on the way he saw a vision of which he told his companions asking <br/>
for an interpretation. ‘I saw my head had been shaved and a bird was <br/>
coming out of my mouth and a woman met me and took me into her womb, <br/>
and I saw my son seeking me anxiously; then I saw him withheld from me.’ <br/>
They said that they hoped it would prove a good omen, but he went on to <br/>
say that he himself would provide the interpretation of it. The shaving of <br/>
his head meant that he would lay it down; the bird which fiew r from his <br/>
mouth was his spirit; and the woman who received him into her womb <br/>
was the earth which would be opened for him and he would be hidden <br/>
therein; his son’s vain search for him meant that he would try to attain 255 <br/>
what he had attained. He was slain as a martyr in al-Yamama while his <br/>
son was severely wounded and recovered later. He was actually killed <br/>
in the year of the Yarmuk in the time of 'Umar, dying as a martyr (216). </p>
<p>THE AFFAIR OF THE I RASH IT E WHO SOLD HIS CAMELS 257 <br/>
TO ABU JAHL </p>
<p>Despite Abu Jahl’s hostility, hatred, and violence towards the apostle <br/>
God humiliated him before him whenever he saw him. </p>
<p>I was told by 'Abdu’l-Malik b. 'Abdullah b. Abu Sufyan al-Thaqafi <br/>
who had a good memory: A man from Irash (209) brought some camels of <br/>
his to Mecca and Abu Jahl bought them from him. He kept back the <br/>
money/so the man came to the assembly of Quraysh when the apostle <br/>
was sitting at the side of the mosque and said: ‘Who among you w r ill <br/>
help me to get what is due to me from Abu’l-Hakam b. Hisham? I am a </p>
<p>1 According to Ibnu’I-Kalbi, al-Afnam , Cairo, 1924, p. 37, it belonged to a sub-section <br/>
of Daus, called the B. Munhib. </p>
<p>B 4080 </p>
<p>N </p>
<p>178 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>stranger, a wayfarer, and he will not pay his debt.’ They said: ‘Do you see <br/>
that man sitting there?’ pointing to the apostle. (In fact they were making <br/>
game of him for they knew quite w r ell of the enmity between him and Abu <br/>
Jahh) ‘Go to him. He’ll help you to your right.’ </p>
<p>So the man went and stood over the apostle and said, ‘O Servant of <br/>
God, Abu’l-Hakam b. Hisham has withheld the money he owes me. I am <br/>
a stranger, a wayfarer, and I asked these men to tell me of someone who <br/>
would help me to my right and they pointed to you, so get my money <br/>
from him, God bless you.’ He said, Go to him,’ and the apostle got up <br/>
and went with him. When they saw this, the men said to one of their <br/>
number, ‘Follow him.’ The apostle went to his house and knocked on the <br/>
door, and when he asked who was there he said, ‘Muhammad! Come out to <br/>
me.’ He came out to him pale with agitation, and the apostle said, ‘Pay <br/>
this man his due.’ ‘One moment until I give him his money,’ he said, <br/>
and went indoors and came out again with the amount he owed and paid it <br/>
to the man. The apostle went away saying, ‘Go about your business.’ <br/>
The Irashite went back to the gathering and said, ‘May God reward him, <br/>
for he has got me my due.’ </p>
<p>Then the man they had sent after them came back and reported what <br/>
258 he had seen. ‘It was extraordinary,’ he said ; ‘he had hardly knocked on the <br/>
door when out he came breathless with agitation,’ and he related what had <br/>
been said. Hardly had he done so when Abu Jahl himself came up and <br/>
they said: ‘Whatever has happened, man? We’ve never seen anything like <br/>
w r hat you’ve done.’ ‘Confound you,’ he said; ‘By God as soon as he <br/>
knocked on my door and I heard his voice I was filled with terror. And <br/>
when I went out to him there was a camel stallion tow'ering above his head. <br/>
I’ve never seen such a head and shoulders and such teeth on a stallion <br/>
before. By God, if I’d refused to pay up he would have eaten me.’ 1 </p>
<p>RUKANA AL-MUTTALIBl WRESTLES WITH THE APOSTLE </p>
<p>My father Ishaq b. Yasar told me saying: Rukana b. 'Abdu Yazid b. <br/>
Hashim b. 'Abdu’l-Muttalib b. 'Abdu Manaf was the strongest man among <br/>
Quraysh, and one day he met the apostle in one of the passes of Mecca <br/>
alone: 'Rukana,’ said he, ‘why w r on*t you fear God and accept my preach¬ <br/>
ing?’ ‘If I knew that what you say is true I would follow you,’ he said. <br/>
The apostle then asked him if he would recognize that he spoke the truth <br/>
if he threw him, and when he said Yes they began to wrestle, and when the <br/>
apostle got a firm grip of him he threw him to the ground, he being unable <br/>
to offer any effective resistance. ‘Do it again, Muhammad,’ he said, and he <br/>
did it again. ‘This is extraordinary,’ he said, ‘can you really throw me?’ <br/>
‘I can show you something more wonderful than that if you wish. I will <br/>
call this tree that you see and it will come to me.’ ‘Call it,’ he said. He </p>
<p>1 I have endeavoured to reproduce the simple somewhat rough style of the original. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>called it and it advanced until it stood before the apostle. Then he said, <br/>
‘Retire to your place,’ and it did so. </p>
<p>Then Rukana went to his people the B. 'Abdu Manaf and told them that <br/>
their tribesman could compete with any sorcerer in the world, for he had <br/>
never seen such sorcery in his life, and he went on to tell them of what he <br/>
had seen and what Muhammad had done. </p>
<p>A DEPUTATION OF CHRISTIANS ACCEPT ISLAM </p>
<p>While the apostle was in Mecca some twenty Christians came to him from <br/>
Abyssinia when they heard news of him. They found him in the mosque <br/>
and sat and talked with him, asking him questions, while some Quraysh- <br/>
ltes were in their meeting round the Ka'ba. When they had asked all <br/>
the questions they wished the apostle invited them to come to God and <br/>
read the Quran to them. When they heard the Quran their eyes flowed <br/>
with tears, and they accepted God’s 1 call, believed in him, and declared <br/>
his truth. They recognized in him the things which had been said of him <br/>
in their scriptures. When they got up to go away Abu Jahl with a number <br/>
of Quraysh intercepted them, saying, ‘God, what a wretched band you <br/>
are! ’iour people at home sent you to bring them information about the <br/>
fellow, and as soon as you sat with him you renounced your religion and <br/>
believed what he said. We don’t know a more asinine band than you,’ or <br/>
wwds to that effect. They answered: ‘Peace be upon you. We willnot <br/>
engage in foolish controversy with you. We have 011/religion and you <br/>
have yours. We have not been remiss in seeking what is best.’ </p>
<p>It is said that these Christians came from Najran, but God knows <br/>
whether that was so. It is also said, and again God knows best, that it was <br/>
in reference to them that the verses ‘Those to whom we brought the book <br/>
aforetime, they believe in it. And when it is read to them they say We <br/>
believe in it. Verily it is the truth from our Lord. Verily aforetime we <br/>
were Muslims, as far as the words, ‘We have our works and you have your <br/>
works. Peace be upon you; we desire not the ignorant.’ 2 </p>
<p>I asked Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri about those to whom these verses had <br/>
reference and he told me that he had always heard from the learned that <br/>
they were sent down concerning the Negus and his companions and also <br/>
the verses from the sura of The Table from the words ‘That is because <br/>
there are of them presbyters and monks and because they are not proud’ <br/>
up to the words ‘So inscribe us with those who bear witness’. 3 </p>
<p>When the apostle used to sit in the mosque with his more insignificant 260 <br/>
companions such as Khabbab, 'Ammar, Abu Fukayha, Yasar, freedman of <br/>
Safwan b. Umayya b. Muharrith, Suhayb, and their like, Quraysh used <br/>
to jeer at them and say to one another, ‘These are his companions, as you <br/>
see. Is it such creatures that God has chosen from among us to give </p>
<p>1 Or, ‘his call’. </p>
<p>Sura 28. 53-55. </p>
<p>3 Sura 5. 85, </p>
<p>180 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>guidance and truth? If what Muhammad has brought were a good thing <br/>
these fellows would not have been the first to get it, and God would not <br/>
have put them before us.’ God revealed concerning them: ‘Drive not <br/>
away those who call upon their Lord night and morning seeking His face. <br/>
You are in no way responsible for them, and they are in no way responsible <br/>
for you, so that you should drive them away and become an evildoer. Thus <br/>
We tempt some by others that they may say, Are these they whom God <br/>
has favoured among us? Does not God know best about the grateful? <br/>
And when those who believe in Our signs come to thee say Peace be upon <br/>
you. Your Lord hath prescribed for Himself mercy that he who doeth <br/>
evil in ignorance and repenteth afterwards and doeth right (to him) He <br/>
is forgiving, merciful.’ 1 </p>
<p>According to my information the apostle used often to sit at al-Marwa <br/>
at the booth of a young Christian called Jabr, 2 a slave of the B. al-Hadraml, <br/>
and they used to say ‘The one who teaches Muhammad most of what he <br/>
brings is Jabr the Christian, slave of the B. al-Hadraml.’ Then God revealed <br/>
in reference to their words ‘We well know that they say, “Only a mortal <br/>
teaches him’’.’ The tongue of him at whom they hint is foreign, and this is <br/>
a clear Arabic tongue (218). 3 </p>
<p>261 THE COMING DOWN OF THE SURA AL-KAUTHAR </p>
<p>I have been told that when the apostle was mentioned Al-'As b. Wa’il <br/>
al-Sahml used to say, ‘Let him alone for he is only a childless man with <br/>
no offspring. If he were to die, his memory would perish and you would <br/>
have rest from him.’ God sent down in reference to that: ‘We have given <br/>
you al-Kauthar,’ 4 something which is better for you than the world and all <br/>
that it holds. Kauthar means ‘great’. Labid b. Rabl'a al-Kilabl said: </p>
<p>We were distressed at the death of the owner of Malhub 5 </p>
<p>And at al-Rida' 6 is the house of another great man ( kauthar ) (219). </p>
<p>Ja'far b. ‘Amr (220) told me on the authority of 'Abdullah b. Muslim <br/>
the brother of Muhammad b. Muslim b. Shihab aLZuhrf from Anas b. ■ <br/>
Malik that the latter said: ‘When the apostle was asked what Kauthar was <br/>
263 which God had given to him I heard him say It is a river as broad as from <br/>
San'S’ to Ayla. Its water pots are in number as the stars of heaven. Birds <br/>
go down to it with necks like camels. 'Umar b. al-Khattab said, “O <br/>
apostle of God the birds must be happy!” He answered “He who eats <br/>
them will be happier still!” ’ </p>
<p>1 Sur« 6. 52 f. </p>
<p>1 N6ldeke, Der Islam , v (1914), 163, was of the opinion that this man was an Abyssinian <br/>
slave, the name Gabru (Gabre) meaning ‘slave of’ in Eth </p>
<p>3 Sura 16. 105. * Sura to8. </p>
<p>5 MalJjub is said to be either the name of water belonging to the B. Asad b. Khuzayma, <br/>
or a village of the B, 'Abdullah b. al-Duwal b. Hanifa in al-Yamima; or a horse. Cf. Diwan, <br/>
ed. Yusuf al-Ch 81 idI, Wien, 1880, p. 78. </p>
<p>6 Ridi' is the name of a watering place of the B. al-A'raj b. Ka'b. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 181 </p>
<p>In this connexion (or perhaps some other) I heard that he said: ‘He <br/>
that drinketh thereof shall never thirst.’ 1 </p>
<p>THE COMING DOWN OF ‘WHY HAS NOT AN ANGEL BEEN <br/>
SENT DOWN TO HIM?’ </p>
<p>The apostle called his people to Islam and preached to them, and Zama'a <br/>
b. al-Aswad, and al-Nadr b. al-Harith, and al-Aswad b. 'Abdu Yaghuth, <br/>
and Ubayy b. Khalaf, and al- As b. Wa’il said: ‘0 Muhammad, if an angel <br/>
had been sent with thee to speak to men about thee and to be seen with <br/>
thee! I hen God sent down concerning these words of theirs: ‘They say <br/>
Why hath not an angel been sent down to him ? If We sent an angel down <br/>
the matter would be settled; they would be given no more time. Had We <br/>
appointed him an angel We would have appointed him as a man and We <br/>
should have obscured for them what they obscure.’ 2 </p>
<p>THE COMING DOWN OF ‘APOSTLES HAVE BEEN MOCKED <br/>
BEFORE THEE’ </p>
<p>I have heard that the apostle passed by al-W’alld b. al-Mughlra and <br/>
Umayya b. Khalaf and Abu Ja 1 1 1 b. Hisham and they reviled and mocked <br/>
him, and this caused him distress. So God sent down, to him concerning <br/>
this: ‘Apostles have been mocked before thee, but that which they mocked <br/>
at hemmed them in.’ 3 </p>
<p>inn rsiuni JUUK1NEY AND THE ASCENT TO HEAVEN </p>
<p>Ziyad b. 'Abdullah al-Bakka’i from Muhammad b. Ishaq told me the <br/>
following: Then the apostle was carried by night from the mosque at <br/>
Mecca to the Masjfd al-Aqsa, which is the temple of Aelia, when Islam <br/>
had spread in Mecca among the Quraysh and all the tribes. </p>
<p>The following account reached me from 'Abdullah b. Mas'ud and Abu <br/>
Sa id al-Kfrlidrl, and 'A’isha the prophet’s wife, and Mu'awiya b. Abu <br/>
Sufyan, and al-Hasan b. Abu’l-Hasan al-Basrl, and Ibn Shihab al-Zuhrl <br/>
and Qatada and other traditionists, and Umm Hani’d. of Abu Talib. It <br/>
is pieced together in the story that follows, each one contributing something <br/>
of what he w'as told about what happened when lie was taken on the night <br/>
journey. The matter of the place 4 of the journey and what is said about it <br/>
is a searching test and a matter of God’s power and authority wherein is a <br/>
lesson for the intelligent; and guidance and mercy and strengthening to <br/>
those who believe. It was certainly an act of God by which He took him </p>
<p>1 Cf. John 4. 14. <br/>
3 Bura 6. 10. </p>
<p>2 Sura 6. 8. </p>
<p>4 Or {masra). </p>
<p>182 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>by night in what way He pleased 1 to show him His signs which He willed <br/>
him to see so that he witnessed His mighty sovereignty and power by <br/>
which He does what He walls to do. </p>
<p>According to what I have heard 'Abdullah b. Mas'iid used to say: <br/>
Buraq, the animal whose every stride carried it as far as its eye could reach <br/>
On which the prophets before him used to ride was brought to the apostle <br/>
and he w r as mounted on it. His companion (Gabriel) went with him to see <br/>
the wonders between heaven and earth, until he came to Jerusalem’s temple. <br/>
There he found Abraham the friend of God, Moses, and Jesus assembled <br/>
with a company of the prophets, and he prayed with them. Then he w r as <br/>
brought three vessels containing milk, wine, and water respectively. The <br/>
apostle said: ‘I heard a voice saying when these were offered to me: If <br/>
he takes the water he will be drowned and his people also; if he takes the <br/>
wine he will go astray and his people also; and if he takes the milk he will <br/>
264 be rightly guided and his people also. So I took the vessel containing <br/>
milk and drank it. Gabriel said to me, You have been rightly guided <br/>
and so will your people be, Muhammad.’ </p>
<p>I was told that al-Hasan said that the apostle said: ‘While I was sleeping <br/>
in the Hljr Gabriel came and stirred me with his foot. I sat up but saw <br/>
nothing and lay down again. He came a second time and stirred me with <br/>
his foot. I sat up but saw- nothing and lay down again. He came to me the <br/>
third time and stirred me with his foot. I sat up and he took hold of my <br/>
arm and I stood beside him and he brought me out to the door of the <br/>
mosque and there was a white animal, half mule, half donkey, with wings <br/>
on its sides with which it propelled its feet, putting down each forefoot <br/>
at the limit of its sight and he mounted me on it. Then he went out with <br/>
me keeping close to me. </p>
<p>I was told that Qatada said that he was told that the apostle said: ‘When <br/>
I came up to mount him he shied. Gabriel placed his hand on its mane and <br/>
said, Are you not ashamed, O Buraq, to behave in this w r ay? By God, none <br/>
more honourable before God than Muhammad has ever ridden you before. <br/>
The animal was so ashamed that he broke out into a sweat and stood still <br/>
so that I could mount him.’ </p>
<p>In his story al-Hasan said: ‘The apostle and Gabriel went their way <br/>
until they arrived at the temple at Jerusalem. There he found Abraham, <br/>
Moses, and Jesus among a company of the prophets. The apostle acted <br/>
as their imam in prayer. Then he was brought two vessels, one containing <br/>
wine and the other milk. The apostle took the milk and drank it, leaving <br/>
the wine. Gabriel said: “You have been rightly guided to the way of nature 2 <br/>
and so W'ill your people be, Muhammad. Wine is forbidden you.” Then <br/>
the apostle returned to Mecca and in the morning he told Quraysh what <br/>
had happened. Most of them said, “By God, this is a plain absurdity! A </p>
<p>1 I think that by Kayfa shd a the author means to leave open the question whether it was <br/>
an actual physical journey or a nocturnal vision. See below. </p>
<p>2 Fitra is an elusive word. The meaning here may be ‘the true primeval religion’ </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 183 </p>
<p>caravan takes a month to go to Syria and a month to return and can Muham¬ <br/>
mad do the return journey in one night?” Many Muslims gave up their <br/>
faith; some went to Abu Bakr and said, “What do you think of your friend 265 <br/>
now, Abu Bakr ? He alleges that he went to Jerusalem last night and prayed <br/>
there and came back to Mecca.” He replied that they were lying about <br/>
the apostle; but they said that he was in the mosque at that very moment <br/>
telling the people about it. Abu Bakr said, “If he says so then it is true. </p>
<p>And what is so surprising in that ? He tells me that communications from <br/>
God from heaven to earth come to him in an hour of a day or night and I <br/>
believe him, and that is more extraordinary than that at which you boggle!” </p>
<p>He then went to the apostle and asked him if these reports were true, and <br/>
when he said they were, he asked him to describe Jerusalem to him.’ Al- <br/>
Hasan said that he was lifted up so that he could see the apostle speaking as <br/>
he told Abu Bakr what Jerusalem was like. Whenever he described a part <br/>
of it he said, ‘That’s true. I testify that you are the apostle of God’ until <br/>
he had completed the description, and then the apostle said, ‘And you, </p>
<p>Abu Bakr, are the Stddiq .’ 1 This was the occasion on which he got this <br/>
honorific. </p>
<p>Al-Hasan continued: God sent down concerning those who left Islam <br/>
for this reason: ‘We made the vision which we showed thee only for a test <br/>
to men and the accursed tree in the Quran. We put them in fear, but it <br/>
only adds to their heinous error.’ 2 Such is al-Hasan’s story with additions <br/>
from Qatada. </p>
<p>One of Abu Bakr’s family told me that 'A’isha the prophet’s wife used <br/>
to say: ‘The apostle’s body remained w r here it was but God removed his <br/>
spirit by night.’ </p>
<p>Ya'qub b. 'Utba b. al-Mughlra b. al-Akhnas told me that Mu'awiya <br/>
b. Abu Sufyan when he was asked about the apostle’s night journey said, </p>
<p>‘It was a true vision from God.’ What these two latter said does not <br/>
contradict what al-Hasan said, seeing that God Himself said, ‘We made <br/>
the vision which we showed thee only for a test to men;’ nor does it con¬ <br/>
tradict what God said in the story of Abraham when he said to his son, </p>
<p>‘O my son, verily I saw in a dream that I must sacrifice thee,’ 3 and he 266 <br/>
acted accordingly. Thus, as I see it, revelation from God comes to the <br/>
prophets waking or sleeping. </p>
<p>I have heard that the apostle used to say, ‘My eyes sleep while my heart <br/>
is awake.’ Only God knows how revelation came and he saw what he <br/>
saw. But whether he was asleep or awake, it was all true and actually <br/>
happened. </p>
<p>Al-Zuhri alleged 4 as from Sa'id b. al-Musayyab that the apostle de¬ <br/>
scribed to his companions Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, as he saw them that <br/>
night, saying: ‘I have never seen a man more like myself than Abraham. </p>
<p>1 This indicates that the meaning is not ‘Veracious’ but ‘Testifier to the Truth’. </p>
<p>2 Sura 13. 62. 3 Sura 37. 10. </p>
<p>4 The verb implies grave doubt as to the speaker’s veracity. </p>
<p>184 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Moses was a ruddy faced man, tall, thinly fleshed, curly haired with ; a <br/>
hooked nose as though he were of the Shanu’a. Jesus, Son of Mary, was a <br/>
reddish man of medium height with lank hair with many freckles on his <br/>
face as though he had just come from a bath. 1 One would suppose that his <br/>
head was dripping with water, though there was no water on it. The <br/>
man most like him among you is ‘Urwa b. Mas'ud al-Thaqafi (221)/ </p>
<p>267 The following report has reached me from Umm Hand d. of Abu <br/>
Talib, whose name was Hind, concerning the apostle’s night journey. <br/>
She said: ‘The apostle went on no night journey except while he was in my <br/>
house. He slept that night in my house. He prayed the final night prayer, <br/>
then he slept and we slept. A little before dawn the apostle woke us, and <br/>
when we had prayed the dawn prayer he said, “O Umm Hand, I prayed <br/>
with you the last evening prayer in this valley as you saw. Then I went to <br/>
Jerusalem and prayed there. Then I have just prayed the morning prayer <br/>
with you as you see.” He got up to go out and I took hold of his robe and <br/>
laid bare his belly as though it were a folded Egyptian garment. I said, <br/>
”0 prophet of God, don’t talk to the people about it for they will give you <br/>
the lie and insult you.” He said, “By God, I certainly will tell them.” <br/>
I said to a negress, a slave of mine, Follow the apostle and listen to what <br/>
he says to the people, and what they say to him. He did tell them and they <br/>
were amazed and asked what proof he had. He replied that he had passed <br/>
the caravan of so-and-so in such-and-such a valley and the animal he <br/>
bestrode scared them and a camel bolted, “and I showed them where it was <br/>
as I was on the way to Syria. I carried on until in Dajanan 2 I passed by a <br/>
caravan of the Banu so-and-so. I found the people asleep. They had a <br/>
jar of water covered with something. I took the covering off and drank <br/>
the water replacing the cover. The proof of that is that their caravan is <br/>
this moment coming down from al-Baida’ by the pass of al-Tan'Im 3 led by <br/>
a dusky camel loaded with two sacks one black and the other multihued”. <br/>
The people hurried to the pass and the first camel they met was as he had <br/>
described. They asked the men about the vessel and they told them that <br/>
they had left it full of water and covered it and that when they woke it was <br/>
covered but empty. They asked the others too who were in Mecca and they <br/>
said that it w r as quite right: they had been scared and a camel had bolted, </p>
<p>268 and they had* heard a rpan calling them to it so that they were able to <br/>
recover it. </p>
<p>THE ASCENT TO HEAVEN </p>
<p>One whom I have no reason to doubt told me on the authority of Abu <br/>
Sa'id al-Khudrl: I heard the apostle say, ‘After the completion of my </p>
<p>1 Dimas = demosian and indicates the foreign origin of this legend. Cf. Musa b. Uqba, <br/>
No. 1, in Introduction, p. xliii. </p>
<p>2 A mountain in the neighbourhood of Tihama. According to al-Waqidl it is 25 m. from <br/>
Mecca. </p>
<p>3 Bai&lt;fa’ is a hill near Mecca on the Medina side. TanTm is on high ground very near <br/>
Mecca. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 185 </p>
<p>business in Jerusalem a ladder was brought to me finer than any I have <br/>
ever seen. It was that to which the dying man looks when death approaches. </p>
<p>My companion mounted it with me until we came to one of the gates of <br/>
heaven called the Gate of the Watchers. An angel called Isma il was in <br/>
charge of it, and under his command were twelve thousand angels each <br/>
of them having twelve thousand angels under his command.’ As he told <br/>
this story the apostle used to say, ‘and none knows the armies^of God but <br/>
He.’ 1 When Gabriel brought me in, Ismail asked who I w^as, and when he <br/>
was told that I was Muhammad he asked if I had been given a mission, 2 <br/>
and on being assured of this he wished me well. </p>
<p>A traditionist who had got it from one who had heard ff from the <br/>
apostle told me that the latter said: ‘All the angels who met me when I <br/>
entered the lowest heaven smiled in welcome and wished me well except <br/>
one who said the same things but did not smile or show that joyful expres¬ <br/>
sion which the others had. And when I asked Gabriel the reason he told <br/>
me that if he had ever smiled cn anyone before or would smile on anyone <br/>
hereafter he would have smiled on me; but he does not smile because he is <br/>
Malik, the Keeper of Hell. I said to Gabriel, he holding the position with <br/>
regard to God which he has described to you “obeyed there, trustworthy”, 3 <br/>
“Will you not order him to show me hell?” And he said, “Certainly! </p>
<p>O Malik, show Muhammad Hell.” Thereupon he removed its covering <br/>
and the flames blazed high into the air until I thought that they would <br/>
consume everything. So I asked Gabriel to order him to send them back 269 <br/>
to their place which he did. I can only compare the effect of their with¬ <br/>
drawal to the falling of a shadow, until when the flames retreated whence <br/>
they had come, Malik placed their cover on them.’ </p>
<p>In his tradition Abu Sa'id al-Khudrl said that the apostle said: ‘When <br/>
I entered the lowest heaven I saw a man sitting there with the spirits of <br/>
men passing before him. To one he w r ould speak well aiid rejoice in him <br/>
saying: “A good spirit from a good body” and of another he would say <br/>
“Faugh!” and frown, saying: “An evil spirit from an evil body.” In <br/>
answer to my question Gabriel told me that this was our father Adam <br/>
reviewing the spirits of his offspring; the spirit of a believer excited his <br/>
pleasure, and the spirit of an infidel excited his disgust so that he said the <br/>
words just quoted. </p>
<p>‘Then I saw men with lips like camels; in their hands were pieces of <br/>
fire like stones which they used to thrust into their mouths and they would <br/>
come out of their posteriors. I w'as told that these were those who sinfully <br/>
devoured the wealth of orphans. </p>
<p>‘Then I saw men in the way of the family of Pharaoh, 4 with such bellies <br/>
as I have never seen; there were passing over them as it were camels </p>
<p>1 Sura 74. 34. </p>
<p>1 Or perhaps simply ‘sent for’. 3 Sura 81. 21. </p>
<p>4 The allusion is to Sura 40. 49 'Cast the family of Pharaoh into the worst of all punish¬ <br/>
ments’. </p>
<p>i86 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>maddened by thirst when they were cast into hell, treading them down, <br/>
they being unable to move out of the way. These were the usurers. </p>
<p>‘Then I saw men with good fat meat before them side by side with lean <br/>
stinking meat, eating of the latter and leaving the former. These are those <br/>
who forsake the women which God has permitted and go after those he has <br/>
forbidden. </p>
<p>‘Then I saw women hanging by their breasts. These were those who </p>
<p>270 had fathered bastards on their husbands.’ </p>
<p>Ja'far b. 'Amr told me from al-Qasim b. Muhammad that the apostle <br/>
said: ‘Great is God’s anger against a woman who brings a bastard into her <br/>
family. He deprives the true sons of their portion and learns the secrets <br/>
of the harim .’ </p>
<p>To continue the tradition of Sa'Id al-Khudri: ‘Then I was taken up <br/>
to the second heaven and there were the two maternal cousins Jesus, Son <br/>
of Mary, and John, son of Zakariah. Then to the third heaven and there was <br/>
a man whose face was as the moon at the full. This was my brother Joseph, <br/>
son of Jacob. Then to the fourth heaven and there was a man called <br/>
Idris. “And we have exalted him to a lofty place.” 1 Then to the fifth heaven <br/>
and there was a man with white hair and a long beard, never have I seen <br/>
a more handsome man than he. This was the beloved among his people <br/>
Aaron son of 'Imran. Then to the sixth heaven, and there was a dark man <br/>
with a hooked nose like the Shanu’a. This was my brother Moses, son of <br/>
’Imran. Then to the seventh heaven and there was a man sitting on a <br/>
throne at the gate of the immortal mansion. 2 Every day seventy thousand <br/>
angels went in not to come back until the resurrection day. Never have I <br/>
seen a man more like myself. This was my father Abraham. Then he <br/>
took me into Paradise and there I saw a damsel with dark red lips and I <br/>
asked her to whom she belonged, for she pleased me much when I saw <br/>
her, and she told me “Zayd b. Haritha”. The apostle gave Zayd the good <br/>
news about her.’ </p>
<p>From a tradition of 'Abdullah b. Mas'ud from the prophet there has <br/>
reached me the following: When Gabriel took him up to each of the </p>
<p>271 heavens and asked permission to enter he had to say whom he had brought <br/>
and whether he had received a mission 3 and they would say ‘God grant <br/>
him life, brother and friend!’ until they reached the seventh heaven and <br/>
his Lord. There the duty of fifty prayers a day was laid upon him. </p>
<p>The apostle said: ‘On my return I passed by Moses and what a fine <br/>
friend of yours he was! He asked me how many prayers had been laid <br/>
upon me and when I told him fifty he said, “Prayer is a weighty matter <br/>
and your people are weak, so go back to your Lord and ask him to reduce <br/>
the number for you and your community”. I did so and He took off ten. <br/>
Again I passed by Moses and he said the same again; and so it went on </p>
<p>1 Sura 19. 58. </p>
<p>2 al-bayt al-mamur. In view of what follows this would seem to mean Paradise itself </p>
<p>( al-janna ). 3 Or ‘been sent for’, v.s. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 187 </p>
<p>until only five prayers for the whole day and night were left. Moses again <br/>
gave me the same advice. I replied that I had been back to my Lord and <br/>
asked him to reduce the number until I was ashamed, and I would not do it <br/>
again. He of you who performs them in faith and trust will have the <br/>
reward of fifty prayers.’ </p>
<p>HOW GOD DEALT WITH THE MOCKERS </p>
<p>The apostle remained firm counting on God’s assistance, admonishing his <br/>
people in spite of their branding him as a liar and insulting and mocking <br/>
him. The principal offenders—so Yazld b. Ruman from 'Urwa b. al- <br/>
Zubayr told me—were five men who were respected and honoured among <br/>
their tribesmen: of the B. Asad . . . was al-Aswad b. al-Muttalib b. Asad 272 <br/>
Abu Zama'a. (I have heard that the apostle had cursed him for his insults <br/>
and mockery, saying, ‘O God, blind him and bereave him of his son!’) </p>
<p>Of the B. Zuhra . . . was al-Aswad b. 'Abdu Yaghuth. Of the B. Makhzum <br/>
. . . was al-Walid b. al-Mughlra ... Of the B. Sahm b. ’Amr . . . was <br/>
al-'As b. Wa’il b. Hisham (222). Of the B. Khuza'a was al-Harith b. <br/>
al-TuIatila b. 'Amr b. al-Harith b. 'Abd b. 'Amr b. Lu’ayy b. Malakan. </p>
<p>When they persisted in evil and constantly mocked the apostle, God <br/>
revealed: ‘Proclaim what you have been ordered and turn away from the <br/>
polytheists. We will surely protect you against the mockers who put <br/>
another god beside God. In the end they will know.’ 1 </p>
<p>The same Yazld told me from 'Urwa (or it may have been from some <br/>
other traditionist) that Gabriel came to the apostle when the mockers were <br/>
going round the temple. He stood up and the apostle stood at his side; <br/>
and as al-Aswad b. al-Muttalib passed, Gabriel threw a green leaf in his <br/>
face and he became blind. Then al-Aswad b. 'Abdu Yaghuth passed and he <br/>
pointed at his belly which swelled so that he died of dropsy. Next al-Walid <br/>
passed by. He pointed at an old scar on the bottom of his ankle (the result <br/>
of a wound he received some years earlier as he was trailing his gown when <br/>
he passed by a man of Khuza'a who was feathering an arrow, and the <br/>
arrowhead caught in his wrapper and scratched his foot—a mere nothing). </p>
<p>But the wound opened again and he died of it. Al-'As passed. He pointed <br/>
to his instep, and he went off on his ass making for al-Ta’if. He tied the <br/>
animal to a thorny tree and a thorn entered his foot and he died of it. <br/>
Lastly al-Harith passed. He pointed at his head. It immediately filled <br/>
with pus and killed him. </p>
<p>THE STORY OF ABU UZAYHIR AL-DAUSI 273 </p>
<p>When al-Walld’s death was near he summoned his three sons Hisham, <br/>
al-Waltd, and Khalid and said: ‘My sons, I charge you with three duties; </p>
<p>1 Sura 15. 94. </p>
<p>188 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>be not remiss in any of them. My blood lies on the Khuza'a: don’t let it <br/>
remain uncompensated. I know that they are innocent of it, but I fear that <br/>
you may be ill spoken of because of it when I am dead. Thaqlf owe me <br/>
money in interest; see that you get it. Lastly my dowry money is with <br/>
Abu Uzayhir al-DausI. Don’t let him keep it.’ Now Abu Uzayhir had <br/>
married him to a daughter of his and then withheld her from him and did <br/>
not let him have access to her up to the day of his death. </p>
<p>When al-Walld died, the B. Makhzum leaped upon Khuza'a demanding <br/>
blood-money for al-Walid, saying, ‘It was your man’s arrow that killed <br/>
him.’ He was one of the B. Ka'b, an ally of the B. 'Abdu’l-Muttalib b. <br/>
Hashim. Khuza'a refused their demand and a competition in verse <br/>
followed and the situation became tense. The man whose arrow had <br/>
killed al-Walid was one of the B. Ka'b b. 'Amr of Khuza'a, and 'Abdullah <br/>
b. Abu Umayya b. al-Mughira b. 'Abdullah b. 'Amr b. Makhzum com¬ <br/>
posed the following lines: 1 </p>
<p>I’ll wager that you’ll soon run away <br/>
And leave al-Zahran with its yelping foxes. </p>
<p>And that you’ll leave the water in the vale of Atriqa <br/>
And that you'll ask which Arak trees are the best. </p>
<p>We are folk who do not leave our blood unavenged <br/>
And those we fight do not get to their feet again. </p>
<p>Al-Zahran and al-Arak were camping-grounds of the B. Ka'b of <br/>
Khuza'a. </p>
<p>Al-Jaun b. Abu’I-Jaun, brother of the B. Ka'b b. 'Amr al-Khuza'I, <br/>
answered him: </p>
<p>By God we will not pay unjust bloodwit for al-Walid </p>
<p>Until you see a day when the stars wax faint; </p>
<p>When ,your stout ones will be overthrown one after another </p>
<p>Each in death helplessly opening his mouth. </p>
<p>When you eat your bread and your gruel, </p>
<p>274 Then all of you will weep and wail for al-Walid. </p>
<p>There followed much argument and recrimination until it was apparent <br/>
that it was prestige that was at stake, so Khuza'a paid some of the blood- <br/>
money and they relinquished their claim to the rest. When peace had <br/>
been made al-Jaun said: </p>
<p>Many a man and woman when we made peace </p>
<p>Spoke in surprise of what we paid for al-Walid. </p>
<p>‘Did you not swear that you would not pay unjust compensation for <br/>
al-Walid </p>
<p>Until you had seen a day of great misfortune?’ </p>
<p>1 Yaq. i. 310. </p>
<p>189 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>But we have exchanged 1 war for peace <br/>
Now every traveller may go safely where he will. </p>
<p>But al-Jaun did not stop there but went on to boast of the killing of <br/>
al-Walid, saying that they had brought about his end, all of which was <br/>
false. As a result al-Walid, his son, and his tribe met what they had been <br/>
warned against. Al-Jaun said: </p>
<p>Did not al-Mughira claim that in Mecca <br/>
Ka'b was a great force ? </p>
<p>Don’t boast, Mughira, because you see us <br/>
True Arabs and by-blows walk its streets. </p>
<p>We and our fathers were born there <br/>
As surely as Thablr stands in its place. </p>
<p>Al-Mughira said that to learn our state <br/>
Or to stir up war between us. </p>
<p>For Walid’s blood -will not be paid for: </p>
<p>You know that we do not pay for blood we shed. </p>
<p>The auspicious warrior hit him with an arrow <br/>
Poisoned, while he was full and out of breath. </p>
<p>He fell full length in Mecca’s vale. </p>
<p>’Twas as though a camel fell. </p>
<p>’Twill save me delaying payment for Abu Hisham with <br/>
Miserable 2 little curly haired camels (223). </p>
<p>Then Hisham b. al-Walid attacked Abu Uzayhir while he was in the <br/>
market of Dhu’l-Majaz. Now his daughter 'Atika was the wife of Abu <br/>
Sufyan b. Harb. Abu Uzayhir was a chief among his people and Hisham <br/>
killed him for the dowry money belonging to al-Walld which he had re¬ <br/>
tained, in accordance with his father’s dying injunction. This happened 275 <br/>
after the apostle’s migration to Medina. Badr was over and many of the <br/>
leaders of heathen Quraysh had been slain. Yazid b. Abu Sufyan went out <br/>
and collected the B. 'Abdu Manaf while Abu Sufyan was in Dhu’l-Majaz, <br/>
and people said Abu Sufyan’s honour in the matter of his father-in-law had <br/>
been violated and he will take vengeance for him. When Abu Sufyan heard <br/>
of what his son Yazid had done he came down to Mecca as fast as he could. </p>
<p>He w r as a mild but astute man who loved his people exceedingly, and he <br/>
was afraid that there might be serious trouble among Quraysh because <br/>
of Abu Uzayhir. So he went straight to his son, who was armed among his <br/>
people the B. 'Abdu Manaf and the ‘scented ones’, took his spear out of his <br/>
hand and hit him hard on the head with it, saying, ‘God damn you! Do <br/>
you wish to cause civil war among Quraysh for the sake of a man from <br/>
Daus? We will pay them the bloodmoney if they will accept it.’ Thus he <br/>
put an end to the matter. </p>

<p>j 9 o The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Hassan b. Thabit composed the following lines to excite feeling for <br/>
the murder of Abu Uzayhir and to bring shame on Abu Sufyan for his <br/>
cowardice and betrayal of trust: </p>
<p>The people on both sides of Dhu’l-Majaz rose one morning, </p>
<p>But Ibn Harb’s protege in Mughammas 1 did not! </p>
<p>The farting donkey did not protect him he was bound to defend. </p>
<p>Hind did not avert her father’s shame. </p>
<p>Hisham b. al-Walid covered you with his garments, </p>
<p>Wear them out and mend new ones like them later. </p>
<p>He got what he wanted from him and became famous, </p>
<p>But you were utterly useless. </p>
<p>If the shaykhs at Badr had been present </p>
<p>The people’s sandals would have been red with blood newly shed. </p>
<p>When he heard of this satire Abu Sufyan said: Hassan wants us to <br/>
fight one another for the sake of a man from Daus. By God, what a </p>
<p>poor idea!’ , </p>
<p>Khalid b. al-Walid when the people of TV if became Muslims spoke to <br/>
the apostle about his father’s interest which Thaqif owed him, and a <br/>
traditionist told me that those verses which prohibit the carrying oyer of <br/>
usury from the Jahiliya arose out of Khalid’s demanding interest: ‘O ye <br/>
.76 who believe, fear God .and give up what usury remains to you if you are <br/>
(really) believers’, to the end of the passage. 3 </p>
<p>So far as we know there was no vengeance for Abu Uzayhir until Islam <br/>
made a clear cut between men; however, Dirar b. al-Khattab b. Mirdas <br/>
al-Fihrl went out with a number of Quraysh to the Daus country, and <br/>
came to the dwelling of a woman called Umm Ghaylan, a freedwoman of <br/>
Daus. She used to comb the women’s hair and prepare brides for their <br/>
husbands. Daus wanted to kill them in revenge for Abu Uzayhir, but <br/>
Umm Ghaylan and the women stood in their way and defended them. It <br/>
was in reference to that that Qirar said: </p>
<p>God reward Umm Ghaylan and her women w ill </p>
<p>For their coming without their finery with dishevelled hair. </p>
<p>They saved us at death’s very door <br/>
When the avengers of blood came forth. </p>
<p>She called on Daus and the sandbanks flowed with glory, </p>
<p>The streams on either side carried it on. </p>
<p>God requite 'Amr well. He was not weak, </p>
<p>He did his best for me. </p>
<p>I drew my sword and made play with its edge <br/>
For whom should I fight but myself (224) ? </p>

<p>IQI </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>THE DEATH OF ABU TALIB AND KHADIJA </p>
<p>Those of his neighbours who ill treated the apostle in his house were Abu <br/>
Lahab, al-Hakam b. Abu’l-As . . ., 'Uqba b. Abu Mu'ayt, 'Adiy b. Hamra’ <br/>
al-Thaqafi, and Ibnu’l-Asda’ al-Hudhall. Not one of them became a <br/>
Muslim except al-Hakam. I have been told that one of them used to throw 277 <br/>
a sheepVs uterus at him while he W'as praying; and one of them used to <br/>
throw it into his cooking-pot when it had been placed ready for him. Thus <br/>
the apostle was forced to retire to a wall when he prayed. 'Umar b. 'Abdul¬ <br/>
lah b. 'Urwa b. Zubayr told me on the authority of his father that when <br/>
they threw this objectionable thing at him the apostle took it out on a stick, <br/>
and standing at the door of his house, he would say, ‘O Banu 'Abdu Manaf, <br/>
what sort of protection is this?’ Then he would throw it into the street. </p>
<p>Khadija and Abu Talib died in the same year, and with Khadija’s death <br/>
troubles followed fast on each other’s heels, for she had been a faithful sup¬ <br/>
port to him in Islam, and he used to tell her of his troubles. With the death <br/>
of Abu Talib he lost a strength and stay in his personal life and a defence <br/>
and protection against his tribe. Abu Talib died some three years before <br/>
he migrated to Medina, and it was then that Quraysh began to treat him in <br/>
an offensive way which they would not have dared to follow in his uncle’s <br/>
lifetime. A young lout actually threw dust on his head. </p>
<p>Hisham on the authority of his father 'Urwa told me that when this <br/>
happened the apostle w r ent into his house with the dust still on his head <br/>
and one of his daughters got up to wash it away, weeping as she did so. <br/>
‘Don’t weep, my little girl,’ he said, ‘for God will protect your father.’ <br/>
Meanwhile he was saying, ‘Quraysh never treated me thus while Abu <br/>
Talib was alive.’ </p>
<p>When Abu Talib fell ill and Quraysh learned of his grave condition they <br/>
reminded one another that now that Hamza and 'Umar had accepted Islam <br/>
and Muhammad’s reputation was known among all the Quraysh clans, <br/>
they had better go to Abu Talib and come to some compromise lest they <br/>
be robbed of their authority altogether. </p>
<p>Al-'Abbas b. 'Abdullah b. Ma'bad b. 'Abbas from one of his family from <br/>
Ibn 'Abbas told me that 'Utba and Shayba, sons of Rabl'a, and Abu Jahl 278 <br/>
and Umayya b. Khalaf and Abu Sufyan with sundry other notables went <br/>
to Abu Talib and said: ‘You know your rank with us and now that you are <br/>
at the point of death we are deeply concerned on your account. You know <br/>
the trouble that exists between us and your nephew, so call him and let us <br/>
make an agreement that he will leave us alone and we will leave him alone; <br/>
let him have his religion and we will have ours.’ When he came Abu Talib <br/>
said, ‘Nephew, these notables have come to you that they may give you <br/>
something and to take something from you.’ ‘Yes,’ he answered, ‘you may <br/>
give me one word by which you can rule the Arabs and subject the Persians <br/>
to you.’ ‘Yea,’ said Abu Jahl, ‘and ten words.’ He said: ‘You must say <br/>
There is no God but Allah and you must repudiate what you worship </p>
<p>192 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>beside him.’ They clapped their hands and said, ‘Do you want to make <br/>
all the gods into one God, Muhammad? That would be an extraordinary <br/>
thing.’ Then they said one to another, ‘This fellow is not going to give <br/>
you anything you want, so go and continue with the religion of your fathers <br/>
until God judge between us.’ So saying they departed. </p>
<p>Abu Talib said, ‘Nephew, I don’t think that you asked them anything <br/>
extraordinary.' On hearing this the apostle had hopes that he would accept <br/>
Islam, and he said at once, ‘You say it, uncle, and then I shall be able to <br/>
intercede for you on Resurrection Day.’ Seeing the apostle’s eagerness he <br/>
replied, ‘Were it not that I fear that you and your father’s sons would be <br/>
abused after my death and that Quraysh would think that I had only said <br/>
it in fear of death, I would say it. I should only say it to give you pleasure.’ <br/>
As his death was near, al-'Abbas looked at him as he was moving his lips <br/>
and put his ear close to him and said, ‘Nephew, by God, my brother has <br/>
spoken the word you gave him to say.’ The apostle replied, ‘I did not <br/>
hear it.’ </p>
<p>God revealed concerning the people who came to him with their propo- <br/>
379 sals: ‘Sad. By the renowned Quran, Nay, those who disbelieve are in pride <br/>
and schism’ as far as the words ‘Does he make the gods one God. This is <br/>
an extraordinary thing. Their chiefs went off saying: Go and remain true <br/>
to your gods. This is a thing designed. We have not heard of this in the <br/>
last religion,’ 1 (meaning Christians because they say) ‘Verily God is the <br/>
third of three.’ 2 ‘This is nothing but an invention.’ 3 Then Abu Talib died. </p>
<p>THE APOSTLE GOES TO THAQlF TO SEEK HELP </p>
<p>In consequence of the growing hostility of Quraysh after Abu Talib’s <br/>
death the apostle went to Ta’if to seek help from Thaqlf and their defence <br/>
against his tribe. Also he hoped that they would receive the message which <br/>
God had given him. He went alone. </p>
<p>Yazld b. Ziyad told me from Muhammad b. Ka'b al-Qurazi: ‘When the <br/>
apostle arrived at al-Ta’if he made for a number of Thaqif who were at <br/>
that time leaders and chiefs, namely three brothers: 'Abdu Yalayl, Mas'ud, <br/>
and Habib, sons of *Amr b. ‘Umayr b. ‘Auf b. 'Uqda b. Ghiyara b. 'Auf b. <br/>
Thaqif. One of them had a Quraysh wife of the B. Jumah. The apostle <br/>
sat with them and invited them to accept Islam and asked them to help <br/>
him against his opponents at home. One of them swore that he would tear <br/>
up the covering 4 of the Ka'ba if God had sent him. 4 The other said, <br/>
“Could not God have found someone better than you to send ?” The third <br/>
said, “By God, don’t let me ever speak to you. If you are an apostle from <br/>
God as you say you are, you are far tod important for me to reply to, and if <br/>
^ou are lying against God it is not right that I should speak to you!” So <br/>
the apostle got up and went, despairing of getting any good out of Thaqif. </p>

<p>passed by. They were—so I am told—seven jinn from Nasibin. They <br/>
listened to him and when he had finished his prayer they turned back to <br/>
their people to warn them having believed and responded to what they <br/>
had heard. God has mentioned them in the words “And when We inclined <br/>
to thee certain of the jinn who were listening to the Quran” as far as “and <br/>
He will give you protection from a painful punishment”. 1 And again, <br/>
“Say: It has been revealed unto me that a number of the jinn listened.”’ 2 </p>
<p>THE APOSTLE OFFERS HIMSELF TO THE TRIBES </p>
<p>When the apostle returned to Mecca his people opposed him more bitterly <br/>
than ever, apart from the few lower-class people who believed in him. </p>
<p>T. 1203,3 (T. One of them said that w'hen the apostle left al-Ta’if making for Mecca <br/>
a Meccan passed and he asked him if he would take a message for him; <br/>
and when he said that he would he told him to go to al-Akhnas b. Shariq <br/>
and say, ‘Muhammad says: Will you give me protection so that I may <br/>
convey the message of my Lord ?’ When the man delivered his message <br/>
al-Akhnas replied that an ally could not give protection against a member <br/>
of the home tribe. When he told the apostle of this he asked him if he <br/>
■would go back and ask Suhayl b. 'Amr for his protection in the same words. <br/>
Suhayl sent word that the B. 'Amir b. Lu’ayy do not give protection against <br/>
B, Ka’b. He then asked the man if he would go back and make the same <br/>
application to al-Mut'im b. 'Adly. The latter said, ‘Yes, let him enter,’ <br/>
and the man came back and told the apostle. In the morning al-Mut'im <br/>
having girt on his weapons, he and his sons and his nephews went into the <br/>
mosque. When Abu Jahl saw him he asked, ‘Are you giving protection or <br/>
following him?’ ‘Giving protection, of course,* he said. ‘We give protec¬ <br/>
tion to him whom you protect,’ he said. So the prophet came into Mecca <br/>
and dw r elt there. One day he went into the sacred mosque when the <br/>
polytheists were at the Ka'ba, and when Abu Jahl saw him he said, ‘This is <br/>
your prophet, O B. 'Abdu Manaf.’ 'Utba b. Rabi'a replied: ‘And why <br/>
should you take it amiss if we have a prophet or a king ?’ The prophet was <br/>
told of this, or he may have heard it, and he came to them and said, ‘O <br/>
'Utba, you were not angry on God’s behalf or his apostle’s behalf, but on <br/>
your own account. As for you, O Abu Jahl, a great blow of fate w r ill come <br/>
upon you so that you will laugh little and weep much; and as for you, 0 <br/>
Leaders of Quraysh, a great blow of fate will come upon you so that you <br/>
will experience wffat you most abhor and that perforce!’) 3 </p>
<p>The apostle offered himself to the tribes of Arabs at the fairs whenever <br/>
282 opportunity came, summoning them to God and telling them that he was <br/>
a prophet w r ho had been sent. He used to ask them to believe in him and <br/>
protect him until God should make clear to them the message with which <br/>
he had charged his prophet. </p>

<p>284 of importance coming to Mecca he went to them with his message. 'Asim <br/>
b. 'Umar b. Qatada al-Ansari—more precisely al-Zafari—on the authority <br/>
of some of his shaykhs told me that they said that Suwayd b. al-Samit, <br/>
brother of the B. 'Amr b. 'Auf, came to Mecca on pilgrimage. Suwayd’s <br/>
tribesmen used to call him al-Kamil because of his toughness, his poetry, <br/>
his honour, and his lineage. He it was who said: </p>
<p>There’s many a man you call friend you’d be shocked </p>
<p>If you knew the lies he tells against you in secret. </p>
<p>While he’s with you his words are like honey; </p>
<p>Behind your back a sword aimed at the base of the neck. </p>
<p>What you see of him pleases you, but underneath </p>
<p>He’s a deceitful backbiter cutting through to the marrow. </p>
<p>His eyes will show you what he’s concealing, </p>
<p>Rancour and hatred are in his evil look. </p>
<p>Strengthen me with good deeds: long have you weakened me. 1 </p>
<p>The best friends strengthen without weakening. </p>
<p>He once had a dispute with a man of the B. Sulaym—one of the B. Zi'b b. <br/>
Malik—over a hundred camels, and they appointed an Arab woman diviner <br/>
arbitrator and she gave judgement in his favour, and he and the SulamI <br/>
went aw r ay alone. When they reached the parting of the ways Suwayd <br/>
asked for his property. The man promised to send it, but Suwayd wanted <br/>
to know who would guarantee that the animals would be handed over. As <br/>
he could offer none but himself, Suwayd refused to leave him until he got <br/>
his due. So they came to blows and Suwayd knocked him dow r n, bound <br/>
him closely and took him aw'ay to the country of the B. 'Amr; and there he <br/>
had to stay until his tribesmen paid what was owing. It was in reference <br/>
to that, Suwayd composed these lines: </p>
<p>Don’t think, Ibn Zi'b son of Malik, that I <br/>
Am like the man you deceitfully slew in secret. </p>
<p>When I had been tbrowm I manfully became your match— </p>
<p>Thus the resolute man can change his position— </p>
<p>I locked him under my left arm <br/>
And his cheek remained in the dirt. </p>
<p>285 When he heard about him the apostle sought him out and invited him <br/>
to Islam. He said, ‘Perhaps you’ve got something like that w r hich I have.’ <br/>
‘And what is that?’ asked the apostle. ‘The roll of Luqman,’ meaning the <br/>
wisdom of Luqman, he answered. ‘Hand it to me,’ said the apostle, and <br/>
he handed it over and he said, ‘This discourse is fine, but that which I have <br/>
is better still, a Quran which God has revealed to me which is a guidance <br/>
and a light.’ And the apostle recited the Quran to him and invited him to </p>
<p>1 Lit. ‘feather me . . . cut me’. The figure is that of an arrow which is feathered to <br/>
increase its flight, and whittled into shape for the same reason. Feathering can do no harm, <br/>
but whittling may cause the arrow to break: necessary' it is, but it must not be overdone. </p>
<p>The Lije of Muhammad 1 gy </p>
<p>Islam; he did not withdraw from it but said, ‘This is a fine saving.’ Then <br/>
he went off and rejoined his people in Medina and almost‘at once the <br/>
vaazraj killed him. Some ot his family used to say, ‘In onr opinion he was </p>
<p>a Muslim when he was killed’; he was (in iaa) killed before the battle of <br/>
Bu ath.- </p>
<p>IYAS ACCEPTS ISLAM </p>
<p>Al-Gusayn b/Abdu’l-Rahman b. 'Amr b. Sa'd b. Mu'adh on the authority <br/>
of Mahmud b. Labid told me that when Abu’l-Haysar Anas h. Rafi' came <br/>
to Mecca with members of the B. 'Abdu’l-Ashhal including Ivas b. Mu'adh <br/>
seeking an alliance with Quraysh against their sister tribe the Khazraj the <br/>
apostle heard about them. He came and sat with them and asked them if <br/>
they would like to get something more profitable than their present errand. <br/>
When they asked him what that could be he told them that he was God’s <br/>
apostle sent to humanity to call on them to serve God and not associate <br/>
any other with Him; that He had revealed a book to him; then he told them <br/>
about Islam and read to them some of the Quran. Iyas, who was a young <br/>
man, said, By God, people, this is something better than you came for!’ </p>
<p>1 hereupon Abu’l-Haysar took a handful of dirt from the valley and threw <br/>
it in his face, saying, ‘Shut up! We didn’t come here for this.’ So Iyas <br/>
became silent The apostle left them and they went to Medina and the 2 86 <br/>
battle of Bu ath between Aus and Khazraj took place. </p>
<p>Within a little while Iyas died. Mahmud said: ‘Those of his people <br/>
who were present at his death told me that they heard him continually <br/>
praising and glorifying God until he died. They had no doubt that he <br/>
died a Muslim, he having become acquainted with Islam at that gathering <br/>
when he heard the apostle speak. </p>
<p>THE BEGINNING OF ISLAM AMONG THE HELPERS </p>
<p>When God washed to display His religion openly and to glorify His prophet <br/>
and to fulfil His promise to him, the time came when he met a number of <br/>
the Helpers at one of the fairs; and while he was offering himself to the <br/>
Arab tribes as was his wont he met at al-'Aqaba a number of the Khazraj <br/>
whom God intended to benefit. J </p>
<p>1 b ; ' Lma ^ b ‘ Qat5da me on the authority of some of the </p>
<p>shaykhs of his tribe that they said that when the apostle met them he <br/>
learned by inquiry that they were of the Khazraj and allies of the Tews. </p>
<p>, e !? Vlt . ed the . m t0 Slt Wlth him and expounded to them Islam and recited <br/>
• C ^ Uran *° lhe . m ‘ Now God had prepared the way for Islam in that they </p>
<p>Z JT y it r h J T Wh ° Were P £ °P Ie * scriptures and <br/>
knowledge, while they themselves were polytheists and idolaters. They </p>
<p>had often raided them in their district and whenever bad feeling arose the </p>
<p>1 The battle between Aus and Khazraj; v.i. </p>
<p>198 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Jews used to say to them, ‘A prophet will be sent soon. His day is at hand. <br/>
We shall follow him and kill you by his aid as 'Ad and Iram perished.’ So <br/>
when they heard the apostle’s message they said one to another: ‘This is </p>
<p>287 the very prophet of whom the Jews warned us. Don’t let them get to him <br/>
before us!’ Thereupon they accepted his teaching and became Muslims, <br/>
saying, ‘We have left our people, for no tribe is so divided by hatred and <br/>
rancour as they. Perhaps God will unite them through you. So let us go <br/>
to them and invite them to this religion of yours; and if God unites them <br/>
in it, then no man will be mightier than you.’ Thus saying they returned <br/>
to Medina as believers. </p>

<p>When they came to Medina they told their people about the apostle and </p>
<p>288 invited them to accept Islam until it became so well known among them <br/>
that there was no home belonging to the Helpers but Islam and the apostle <br/>
had been mentioned therein. </p>
<p>THE FIRST PLEDGE AT AL-'AQABA AND THE MISSION <br/>
OF MUS'AB </p>
<p>In the following year twelve Helpers attended the fair and met at al-'Aqaba <br/>
—this was the first 'Aqaba—where they gave the apostle the ‘pledge of <br/>
women’. 1 This was before the duty of making war was laid upon them. </p>
<p>These men were: From B. al-Najjar: As'ad b. Zurara; 'Auf b. al-Harith <br/>
and Mu'adh his brother, both sons of 'Afra’. From B. Zurayq b. 'Amir: <br/>
Rafi* b. Malik and Dhakwan b. 'Abdu Qays b. Khalada b. Mukhlid b. <br/>

b. Zayd b. Ghanm b. Salim: al-'Abbas b. 'Ubada b. Nadal'a b. Malik b. <br/>

<p>From B. Salima: 'Uqba b. 'Amir. </p>
<p>From B. Sawad: Qutba b. 'Amir b. Hadida. The Aus were represented 289 <br/>
by Abu’l-Haytham b. al-Tayyihan whose name was Malik of the clan of <br/>
B. 'Abdu’l-Ashhal b. Jusham b. al-Harith b. al Khazraj b. 'Amr b. Malik b. <br/>
al-Aus (234). </p>
<p>From B. 'Amr b. 'Auf b. Malik b. al-Aus: 'Uwaym b. Sa'ida. </p>
<p>Yazid b. Abu Habib from Abu Marthad b. 'Abdullah al-Yazani from <br/>
'Abdu’l-Rahman b. 'Usayla al-Sannaji from 'Ubada b. al-Samit told me: </p>
<p>‘I was present at the first 'Aqaba. There were twelve of us and we pledged <br/>
ourselves to the prophet after the manner of women and that was before <br/>
war was enjoined, the undertaking being that we should* associate nothing <br/>
with God; we should not steal; we should not commit fornication; nor kill <br/>
our offspring; we should not slander our neighbours; we should not dis¬ <br/>
obey him in what was right; if we fulfilled this paradise would be ours; if <br/>
we committed any of those sins it was for God to punish or forgive as <br/>
He pleased. 1 </p>
<p>Al-Zuhri from 'A’idhullah b. 'Abdullah al-Khaulanl Abu Idris said that <br/>
'Ubada b. al-Samit told him that ‘We gave allegiance to the apostle that <br/>
we would associate nothing with God, not steal, not commit fornication, <br/>
not kill our offspring, not slander our neighbour, not disobey him in what <br/>
was right; if we fulfilled this paradise would be ours; and if we committed <br/>
any of those sins we should be punished in this world and this would serve <br/>
as expiation; if the sin was concealed until the Day of Resurrection, then <br/>
it would be for God to decide whether to punish or to forgive.’ </p>
<p>When these men left, the apostle sent with them Mus'ab b. 'Umayr b. <br/>
Hashim b. ‘Abdu Manaf. . . and instructed him to read the Quran to them 290 <br/>
and to teach them Islam and to give them instruction about religion. In <br/>
Medina Mus'ab was called ‘The Reader’; he lodged with As'ad b. Zurara. </p>
<p>Asim b. Umar told me that he used to lead the prayers because Aus <br/>
and Khazraj could not bear to see one of their rivals take the lead. </p>
<p>THE INSTITUTION OF FRIDAY PRAYERS IN MEDINA </p>
<p>Muhammad b. Abu Umama b. Sahl b. Hunayf from his father from <br/>
Abdu’l-Rahman b. Ka'b b. Malik told me that the latter said: ‘I was leading <br/>
my father Ka'b when he had lost his sight, and when I brought him out to <br/>
the mosque and he heard the call to prayer he called down blessings on <br/>
Abu Umama As'ad b. Zurara. This went on for some time: whenever he <br/>
heard the adhan he blessed him and asked God’s pardon for him. I thought <br/>
that this was an extraordinary thing to do and decided to ask him why he <br/>
did it. He told me that it was because he was the first man to bring them </p>
<p>1 Cf. Sura 60, 12 where the wording is very similar. </p>
<p>1 i.e. no fighting Was involved. Cf. Sura 60. 12. </p>
<p>200 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>together in the low ground of al-Nablt 1 in the quarter of the B. Bayada <br/>
called Naql'u’l-Khadimat. I asked him how many of them there were, <br/>
and he told me that they numbered forty men.’ </p>
<p>‘Ubaydallah b. al-Mughira b. Mu'ayqib and 'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr b. <br/>
Muhammad b. 'Amr b. Hazm told me that As'ad b. Zurara went out with <br/>
Mus'ab b. 'Umayr to the areas of B. 'Abdu’l-Ashhal and of B. Zafar, <br/>
Sa'd b. al-N,u'man b. ImruVl-Qays b. Zayd b. 'Abdu’l-Ashhal was the <br/>
son of As'ad’s aunt. He entered with him one of the gardens of B. Zafar <br/>
2gi (235) by a well called Maraq and sat in the garden and some of the men <br/>
who had accepted Islam gathered together there. Now Sa'd b. Mu'adh <br/>
and Usayd b. Hudayr were at that time leaders of their clan, the B. 'Abdu’l- <br/>
Ashhal, and both followed the heathenism of their tribe. When they heard <br/>
about him Sa'd said to Usayd: ‘Go to these fellows who have entered our <br/>
quarters to make fools of our weak comrades, drive them out and forbid <br/>
them to enter our quarters. If it were not that As'ad b. Zurara is related to <br/>
me as you know I would save you the trouble. He is my aunt s son and I <br/>
can do nothing to him.’ So Usayd took his lance and went to them, and <br/>
when As'ad saw him he said to Mus'ab, ‘This is the chief of his tribe who <br/>
is coming to you, so be true to God with him.’ Mus'ab said, ‘If he will sit <br/>
down I will talk to him. 1 He stood over them looking furious and asking <br/>
what they meant by coming to deceive their weaker comrades. ‘Leave us if <br/>
you value your lives,’ Mus'ab said, ‘Won’t you sit down and listen. If you <br/>
like what you hear you can accept it, and if you don’t like it you can leave <br/>
it alone.’ He agreed that that was fair, stuck his lance in the ground, and <br/>
sat down. He explained Islam to him and read him the Quran. After¬ <br/>
wards they said—according to what has been reported of them—‘By God, <br/>
before he spoke we recognized Islam in his face by its peaceful glow.’ He <br/>
said, ‘What a wonderful and beautiful discourse this is! What does one do <br/>
if he wants to enter this religion ?’ They told him that he must wash and <br/>
purify himself and his garments, then bear witness to the truth and pray. <br/>
He immediately did so and made two prostrations. Then he said, There <br/>
is a man behind me who if he follows you every one of his people will <br/>
follow suit. I will send him to you at once. It is Sa'd b. Mu adh. Taking <br/>
his lance he went off to Sa'd and his people who were sitting in conclave. </p>
<p>292 When Sa'd saw him coming he said, ‘By God, Usayd is coming with a <br/>
different expression from that he had when he left you.’ And when he <br/>
came up he asked what had happened. He said, ‘I have spoken to the two <br/>
men and I find no harm in them, I forbade them to go on and they said <br/>
to me, We will do what you like; and I was told that the B. Haritha had <br/>
gone out against As'ad to kill him because they knew that he was the son of <br/>
your aunt so as to make you appear a treacherous protector of your guests. </p>
<p>Sa'd enraged got up at once, alarmed at what had been said about the B. </p>
<p>1 Hazamu’l-Nabit according to al-Suhayli is a mountain one post from Medina. YJqut <br/>
denies thia, because Hazam means ‘low ground’. He prefers the reading ‘in the low ground <br/>
of the Banu Nabit’, &amp;c. </p>
<p>201 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Haritha. He took the lance from his hand, saying, ‘By God, I see that you <br/>
have been utterly ineffective.’ He went out to them and when he saw them <br/>
sitting comfortably he knew that Usayd had intended that he should listen <br/>
to them. He stood over them, looking furious. To As'ad he said, ‘Were <br/>
it not for the relationship between us you would not have treated me thus. <br/>
Would you behave in our houses in a way we detest ?’ (Now As'ad had <br/>
said to Mus'ab, ‘The leader whom his people follow has come to you. If <br/>
he follows you, no two of them will remain behind.’) So Mus'ab said to <br/>
him what he had said to Usayd, and Sa'd stuck his lance in the ground and <br/>
sat down. The same thing happened again and he went to his people’s <br/>
meeting-place accompanied by Usayd. When they saw him coming they <br/>
said, ‘We swear by God Sa'd has returned with a different expression.’ </p>
<p>And when he stopped by them he asked them how they knew what had <br/>
happened to him. They replied, ‘(You are) our chief, the most active in <br/>
our interests, the best in judgement and the most fortunate in leadership.’ </p>
<p>He said, ‘I will not speak to a man or woman among you until you believe <br/>
in God and His apostle.’ As a result every man and woman among the 293 <br/>
B. 'Abdu’l-Ashhal joined Islam. </p>
<p>As'ad and Mus'ab returned to As'ad’s house and stayed there calling <br/>
men to Islam until every house of the Ansar had men and women who were <br/>
Muslims except those of B. Umayya b. Zayd, and Khatma and Wa’il and <br/>
Waqif; the latter were Aus Allah and of Aus b. Haritha. The reason was <br/>
that Abu Qays b. al-Aslat whose name was Sayfl was among them. He <br/>
w^as their poet and leader and they obeyed him and he kept them back from <br/>
Islam. Indeed he continued to do so until the apostle migrated to Medina, <br/>
and Badr, and Uhud, and al-Khandaq were over. He said concerning <br/>
what he thought of Islam and how men differed about his state: </p>
<p>Lord of mankind, serious things have happened. </p>
<p>The difficult and the simple are involved. </p>
<p>Lord of mankind, if we have erred <br/>
Guide us to the good path. </p>
<p>Were it not for our Lord we should be Jews <br/>
And the religion of Jew r s is not convenient. </p>
<p>Were it not for our Lord we should be Christians <br/>
Along with the monks on Mount Jalil. 1 <br/>
But when we were created we were created <br/>
Hanlfs; our religion is from all generations. </p>
<p>We bring the sacrificial camels walking in fetters <br/>
Covered with cloths but their shoulders bare (236). </p>
<p>THE SECOND PLEDGE AT AL-'AQABA </p>
<p>Then Mus'ab returned to Mecca and the Muslim Ansar came to the fair <br/>
there with the pilgrims of their people who were polytheists. They met </p>
<p>1 i.c. Galilee. </p>
<p>202 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>294 the apostle at al-'Aqaba in the middle of the days of Tashrlq, 1 when God <br/>
intended to honour them and to help His apostle and to strengthen Islam <br/>
and to humiliate heathenism and its devotees. </p>
<p>Ma'bad b. Ka'b b. Malik b. Abu Ka'b b. al-Qayn, brother of the B. <br/>
Salima, told me that his brother 'Abdullah b. Ka'b who was one of the <br/>
most learned of the Ansar told him that his father Ka'b who was one of <br/>
those who had been present at al-'Aqaba and did homage to the apostle, <br/>
informed him saying: ‘We went out with the polytheist pilgrims of our <br/>
people having prayed and learned the customs of the pilgrimage. With us <br/>
was al-Bara’ b. Ma'rur our chief and senior. When we had started our <br/>
journey from Medina al-Bara’ said, “I have come to a conclusion and I <br/>
don’t know whether you will agree with me or not. I think that I will not <br/>
turn my back on this building” (meaning the Ka'ba), “and that I shall pray <br/>
towards it.” We replied that so far as we knew our prophet prayed towards <br/>
Syria 2 and we did not wish to act differently. He said, “lam going to pray <br/>
towards the Ka'ba.” We said, “But we will not.” When the time for <br/>
prayer came we prayed towards Syria and he prayed towards the Ka'ba <br/>
until we came to Mecca. We blamed him for what he w T as doing, but he <br/>
refused to change. When we came to Mecca he said to me, “Nephew, let <br/>
us go to the apostle and ask him about what I did on our journey. For I <br/>
feel some misgivings since I have seen your opposition.” So we went to ask <br/>
the apostle. We did not know him and we had never seen him before. We <br/>
met a man of Mecca and we asked him about the apostle; he asked if we <br/>
knew him and we said that w T e did not. Then do you know his uncle, al- <br/>
* Abbas b. 'Abdu’l-Muftalib ? We said that we did because he was always <br/>
coming to us as a merchant. He said, “When you enter the mosque he is <br/>
the man sitting beside al-'Abbas.” So we went into the mosque and there <br/>
was al-'Abbas sitting with the apostle beside him; we saluted them and sat <br/>
down. The apostle asked al-'Abbas if he knew us, and he said that he did </p>
<p>295 and named us. I shall never forget the apostle’s words when Ka'b’s name <br/>
was mentioned, “The poet?” Al-Bara* said, “O prophet of God, I came on <br/>
this journey God having guided me to Islam and I felt that I could not <br/>
turn my back on this building, so I prayed towards it; but when my com¬ <br/>
panions opposed me I felt some misgivings. What is your opinion, O <br/>
apostle of God ?” He replied, “You would have had a qibla if you had kept <br/>
to it,” so al-BarS’ returned to the apostle’s qibla and prayed with us towards <br/>
Syria. 3 But his people assert that he prayed towards the Ka'ba until the day of <br/>
his death; but this was not so. We know more about that than they (237).” ’ </p>
<p>1 The days of the Tashrlq are the three days following the day of sacrifice, i.e, nth, 12th, <br/>
and 13th of Dhu’l-IJijja. Various explanations are given by the lexicographers: ( a ) because <br/>
the victims were not sacrificed until the sun rose; ( b ) because the flesh of the victims was <br/>
cut into strips and left to dry in the sun on those days; and (c) because in pagan times they <br/>
used to say at that time Ashriq Thabir kayma nughir ‘Show the sun, O Thabir, that we may <br/>
pass on quickly’. See further E.I , and literature cited there. </p>
<p>1 i.e. Jerusalem. </p>
<p>1 The apostle’s reply to al-Barft’ could be taken in either sense, and considerable doubt is <br/>
reflected in the commentaries and traditions on the question involved. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 203 </p>
<p>Ma'bad b. Ka'b told me that his brother 'Abdullah told him that his <br/>
father Ka'b b. Malik said: ‘Then we went to the hajj and agreed to meet <br/>
the apostle at al-'Aqaba in the middle of the days of the tashrlq. When we <br/>
had completed the hajj and the night came in which w r e had agreed to meet <br/>
the apostle there was with us 'Abdullah b. 'Amr b. Haram Abu Jabir, one <br/>
of our chiefs and nobles w r hom we had taken wdth us. We had concealed <br/>
our business from those of our people who were polytheists. We said to <br/>
him, “You are one of our chiefs and nobles and we want to wean you <br/>
from your present state lest you become fuel for the fire in the future.” </p>
<p>1 hen we invited him to accept Islam and told him about our meeting <br/>
with the apostle at al-'Aqaba. Thereupon he accepted Islam and came to <br/>
al-'Aqaba with us, and became a naqib (leader). 1 </p>
<p>‘We slept that night among our people in the caravan until when a third <br/>
of the night had passed we went stealing softly like sandgrouse to our 296 <br/>
appointment with the apostle as far as the gully by al-'Aqaba. There were <br/>
seventy-three men with two of our women: Nusayba d. of Ka'b Umm <br/>
'Umara, one of the women of B. Mazin b. al-Najjar, and Asma’d. of 'Amr <br/>
b. Adiy b. Nabi, one of the women of B. Salima who was known as Umm <br/>
Manf. We gathered together in the gully waiting for the apostle until he <br/>
came with his uncle al-'Abbas who was at that time a polytheist; albeit <br/>
he wanted to be present at his nephew’s business and see that he had <br/>
a firm guarantee. When he sat down he was the first to speak and said: </p>
<p>“O people of al-Khazraj (the Arabs used the term to cover both Khazraj <br/>
and Aus). You know what position Muhammad holds among us. We <br/>
have protected him from our own people who think as we do about <br/>
him. He lives in honour and safety among his people, but he will turn <br/>
to you and join you. If you think that you can be faithful to what you <br/>
have promised him and protect him from his opponents, then assume <br/>
the burden you have undertaken. But if you think that you will betray <br/>
and abandon him after he has gone out with you, then leave him now. </p>
<p>For he is safe where he is.” We replied, “We have heard what you say. </p>
<p>You speak, O apostle, and choose for yourself and for your Lord what <br/>
you wish.” </p>
<p>‘The apostle spoke and recited the Quran and invited men to God and <br/>
commended Islam and then said: “I invite your allegiance on the basis <br/>
that you protect me as you would your women and children.” Al-Bara’ <br/>
took his hand and said “By Him Who sent you with the truth we will <br/>
protect you as we protect our women. We give our allegiance and we are <br/>
men of war possessing arms which have been passed on from father to son.” <br/>
While al-Bara was speaking Abu’l-Haytham b. al-Tayyihan interrupted <br/>
him and said, “O apostle, we have ties with other men (he meant the Jews) <br/>
and if we sever them perhaps when we have done that and God will have <br/>
given you victory, you will return to your people and leave us?” The 297 <br/>
apostle smiled and said: “Nay, blood is blood and blood not to be paid for </p>
<p>1 The term has become technical. </p>
<p>204 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>is blood not to be paid for. 1 I am of you and you are of me. I will war <br/>
against them that war against you and be at peace with those at peace <br/>
with you (238)/’ </p>
<p>Ka'b continued: ‘The apostle said, “Bring out to me twelve leaders that <br/>
they may take charge of their people’s affairs.” They produced nine from <br/>
al-Khazraj and three from al-Aus.’ </p>
<p>THE NAMES OF THE TWELVE LEADERS AND THE REST OF <br/>
THE STORY OF AL-'AQABA </p>
<p>According to what Ziyad b. 'Abdullah al-Bakka’I told us from Muhammad <br/>
b. Ishaq al-Mut^alibi (they were): </p>
<p>From al-Khazraj: Abu Umama As'ad b. Zurara ... b. al-Najjar who was <br/>
Taym Allah b. Tha'laba b. 'Amr b. al-Khazraj; Sa'd b. al-Rabf b. 'Amr b. <br/>
Abu Zuhayr b. Malik b. Imru’u’l-Qays b. Malik b. Tha'laba b. Ka'b b. al- <br/>
Khazraj b. al-Harith. b. al-Khazraj; 'Abdullah b. Rawaha b. Tha'laba of the <br/>
same line; Rafi‘ b. Malik b. al-'Ajlan b. 'Amr . . .; al-Bara’ b. Ma'rur b. <br/>
Sakhr b. Khansa’ b. Sinan b. 'Ubayd b. 'Adiy b. Ghanm b. Ka'b b. Salama <br/>

b. Laudhan b. 'Abdu Wudd b. Zayd b. Tha'laba b. al-Khazraj of the same <br/>
line (240). </p>
<p>From al-Aus: Usayd b. Idudayr b. Simak b. 'Atik b. Rafi' b. Imru’u’l- <br/>
Qays b. Zayd b. 'Abdu’l-Ashhal b. Jusham b. al-Harith b. al-Khazraj b. <br/>

b. al-Nahha^ b. Ka'b b. Idaritha b. Ghanm b. al-Salm b. ImruVl-Qays b. <br/>
Malikb. al-Aus; Rifa'a b. 'Abdu 1 -Mundhir b. Zubayr b. Zayd b. Umayya <br/>
b. Zayd b. Malik b. 'Auf b. 'Amr b. 'Auf b. Malik b. al-Aus (241). </p>
<p>299 'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr told me that the apostle said to the Leaders: ‘You <br/>
are the sureties for your people just as the disciples of Jesus, Son of Mary, <br/>
were responsible to him, while I am responsible for my people, i.e. the <br/>
Muslims.’ They agreed. </p>
<p>'Asim b. 'Umar b. Qatada told me that when the people came together <br/>
to plight their faith to the apostle, al-'Abbas b. 'Ubada b. Nadia al-Ansari, <br/>
brother of B. Salim b. 'Auf, said, ‘0 men of Khazraj, do you realize to <br/>
what you are committing yourselves in pledging your support to this man ? <br/>
It is to war against all and sundry. 2 If you think that if you lose your <br/>
property and your nobles are killed you will give him up, then do so now, <br/>
for it would bring you shame in this world and the next (if you did so </p>
<p>1 i.e. He would treat blood revenge and its obligation as common to both parties. See <br/>
I.H.'g note. a Lit. ‘red and black men'. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 205 </p>
<p>later); but if you think that you will be loyal to your undertaking if you <br/>
lose your property and your nobles are killed, then take him, for by God it <br/>
will profit you in this world and the next.’ They said that they would <br/>
accept the apostle on these conditions. But they asked what they would <br/>
get in return for their loyalty, and the apostle promised them paradise. <br/>
They said, ‘Stretch forth your hand,’ and when he did so they pledged <br/>
their word. 'Asim added that al-'Abbas said that only to bind the obiiga- 300 <br/>
tion more securely on them. 'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr said that he said it <br/>
^ e Jy to kee P the people back that night, hoping that 'Abdullah b. Ubayy <br/>
b. ba ul would come and so give more weight to his people’s support. But <br/>
God knows best which is right (242). </p>
<p>The B. al-Najjar allege that As'ad b. Zurara was the first to strike his <br/>
hand in fealty; the B. 'Abdu’l-Ashhal say that he was not for Abu’l- <br/>
Haytham was the first. Ma'bad b. Ka'b told me in his tradition from his <br/>
brother 'Abdullah b. Ka'b from his father Ka'b b. Malik that al-Bara’ was <br/>
the first and the people followed him. When we had all pledged ourselves <br/>
batan shouted from the top of al-'Aqaba in the most penetrating voice I <br/>
have ever heard, ‘O people of the stations of Mina, do you want this repro¬ <br/>
bate 1 and the apostates 2 who are with him? They have come together to <br/>
make war on you!’ The apostle said, ‘This is the Izb 3 of the hill. This is </p>
<p>the son of Azyab. Do you hear, O enemy of God, I swear I will make an <br/>
end of you! (243). </p>
<p>t toId them t0 dis P erse and go back to their caravan, and </p>
<p>al- Abbas b. Ubada said, ‘By God, if you wish it we will fall on the people <br/>
of Mina tomorrow with our swords.’ He replied, ‘We have not been com¬ <br/>
manded to do that; but go back to your caravan.’ So we went back to our <br/>
beds and slept until the morrow. * </p>
<p>. the morning the leaders of Quraysh came to our encampment say¬ </p>
<p>ing that they had heard that we had come to invite Muhammad to leave <br/>
them and had pledged ourselves to support him in war against them and <br/>
that there was no Arab tribe that they would fight more reluctantly than us. </p>
<p>I hereupon the polytheists of our tribe swore that nothing of the kind had <br/>
happened and they knew nothing of it. And here they were speaking the 301 <br/>
truth for they were in ignorance of what had happened. We looked at one <br/>
another. Then the people got up, among them al-Harith b. Hisham b al- <br/>
Mughira al-Makhzuml who was wearing a pair of new sandals. I spoke a <br/>
W ?jJ d ^though I wanted t0 associate the people with what they had </p>
<p>said, O Abu Jabir, seeing that you are one of our chiefs, can’t you get hold <br/>
of a pair of sandals such as this young Qurayshite has? Al-Harith heard <br/>
me and took them off his feet and threw them at me saying ‘By God vou <br/>
can have them!’ Abu Jabir said, ‘Gently now, you have angered the </p>

<p>The word is said to mean ‘small and contemptible’. </p>

<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>young man, so give him back his sandals.’ ‘By God, I will not, I said, it is </p>
<p>a good omen and if it proves to be true I shall plunder him </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr told me that they came to Abdullah b. Ubayy <br/>
and said to him much the same as Ka'b had said and he replied, This is a <br/>
serious matter; my people are not in the habit of deciding a question with¬ <br/>
out consulting me in this way and I do not know that it has happene . </p>
<p>Thereupon they left him. , </p>
<p>When the people had left Mina they investigated the report closely and <br/>
found that it was true. So they went in pursuit of (our) people and over¬ <br/>
took Sa'd b. 'Ubada in Adhakhir and also al-Mundhir b. Amr, brother ot <br/>
B. Sa'ida, both of them being ‘leaders’. The latter got away but they <br/>
caught Sa'd and tied his hands to his neck with the thongs of the girth <br/>
and brought him back to Mecca beating him on the way and dragging him <br/>
by the hair, for he was a very hairy man. Sa'd said, ‘As they held me, a <br/>
number of Quraysh came up, among them a tall, white, handsome man o <br/>
pleasant appearance and I thought that if there was any decency among <br/>
302 them this man would show it. But when he came up he delivered me a <br/>
violent blow in the face and after that I despaired of fair treatment. As <br/>
they were dragging me along, a man took pity on me and said, You poor <br/>
devil, haven’t you any right to protection from one of the Quraysh? <br/>
“Yes ” I said “I have. I used to guarantee the safety of the merchants ot <br/>
Tubayr b. Muf im b. ‘Adly b. Naufal b. 'Abdu Manaf and protect them <br/>
from those who might have wronged them in my country; also al-H 5 nth <br/>
b. Harb b. Umayya b. 'Abdu Shams b. 'Abdu Manaf. Very well, then, <br/>
call out the names of these two men and say what tie there is between you, <br/>
he said. This I did and that man went to them and found them in the <br/>
mosque beside the Ka'ba and told them of me and that I was calling for <br/>
them and mentioning my claim on them. When they heard who I was they <br/>
acknowledged the truth of my claim and came and delivered^. So ba <br/>
went off. The name of the man who hit him was Suhayl b. Amr, brother <br/>
of B. 'Amir b. Lu’ayy (244). </p>
<p>The first poetry about the Migration was two verses composed by l^irar <br/>
b. al-Khattab b. Mirdas, brother of B. Muharib b. Fihr: </p>
<p>I overtook Sa'd and took him by force. </p>
<p>It would have been better if I had caught Mundhir. </p>
<p>If I had got him his blood would not have to be paid for. </p>
<p>He deserves to be humiliated and left unavenged (244a). </p>
<p>Hassan b. Thabit answered him thus: </p>
<p>You were not equal to Sa'd and the man Mundhir <br/>
When the people’s camels were thin. </p>
<p>But for Abu Wahb (my) verses would have passed over <br/>
The top of al-Barqa’ 1 swooping down swiftly 2 </p>
<p>• Yfiqut says that this is a place in the desert. He does not say where._ </p>

<p>THE IDOL OF * AMR IBNU’L-JAMUH </p>
<p>When they came to Medina they openly professed Islam there. Now some <br/>
of the shaykhs still kept to their old idolatry, among whom was 'Amr b. <br/>
al-Jamuh b. YazTd b. Haram b. Ka'b b. Ghanm b. Ka'b b. Salama whose <br/>
son, Mu'adh, had been present at al-'Aqaba and had done homage to the <br/>
apostle there. 'Amr was one of the tribal nobles and leaders and had set <br/>
up in his house a wooden idol called Manat 3 as the nobles used to do, <br/>
making it a god to reverence and keeping it clean. When the young men of <br/>
the B. Salama Mu'adh b. Jabal and his own son Mu'adh adopted Islam <br/>
with the other men who had been at al-'Aqaba they used to creep in at <br/>
night to this idol of 'Amr’s and carry it away and throw it on its face into <br/>
a cesspit. When the morning came 'Amr cried, ‘Woe to you! Who has <br/>
been at our gods this night ?’ Then he went in search of the idol and when <br/>
he found it he washed it and cleaned it and perfumed it saying, ‘By God, <br/>
if I knew who had done this I would treat him shamefully!’ When night <br/>
came and he was fast asleep they did the same again and he restored the <br/>
idol in the morning. This happened several times until one day he took <br/>
the idol from the place where they had thrown it, purified it as before, and </p>
<p>of this name mentioned by 1.1, (p. 123) was the father of the prophet’s maternal uncle; if it <br/>
is he that is referred to, clearly the meaning must be that the presence of this man in Mecca <br/>
prevented Hassan from launching his invective against Quraysh, and the verb must mean <br/>
swooping or rushing. However, al-Barquqi in his commentary' on the Oilcan tentatively <br/>
suggests that it was Abu Wahb who brought Dirar’s lines to Medina: had he not done so <br/>
they would have fallen impotently on the way. This interpretation requires us to understand <br/>
hawo in the sense of falling, and hussara as ‘wearied’ instead of ‘stripped for action’ and so <br/>
capable of rapid movement. The last line in I.I.’s text follows this line and this rearrange¬ <br/>
ment of the lines would naturally suggest that the qasaid came from the same source; but <br/>
as 1 . 1 . reported the satire such a conclusion is unnecessary. See further Dr. Arafat’s thesis <br/>
on the poetry of Hassan. 1 Or ‘bleached’. </p>
<p>2 i.e. Sends coals to Newcastle. This line follows line 2 in the Ditvart, </p>
<p>3 Suhayll explains that the idol was so called because blood was shed (muniyat) by it as <br/>
an offering and that is why idols are said to be bloody. But the explanation of the name is <br/>
to be found outside the Arabic language in the goddess of Fate. See S. H. Langdon, Semitic <br/>
Mythology, 1931, pp. 19 ff. </p>
<p>208 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>304 fastened his sword to it, saying, ‘By God, I don’t know who has done this; <br/>
but if you are any good at all defend yourself since you have this sword.’ <br/>
At night when he was asleep they came again and took the sword from its <br/>
neck and hung a dead dog to it by a cord and then threw it into a cesspit. <br/>
In the morning 'Amr came and could not find it where it normally was; <br/>
ultimately he found it face downwards in that pit tied to a dead dog. When <br/>
he saw it and perceived what had happened and the Muslims of his clan <br/>
spoke to him he accepted Islam by the mercy of God and became a good <br/>
Muslim. He wrote some verses when he had come to a knowledge of God <br/>
in which he mentioned the image and its impotence and thanked God for <br/>
having delivered him from the blindness and error in which he had lived <br/>
hitherto: </p>
<p>By Allah, if you had been a god you would not have been <br/>
Tied to a dead dog in a cesspit. </p>
<p>Phew! that we ever treated you as a god, but now <br/>
We have found you out and left our wicked folly. </p>
<p>Praise be to God most High, the Gracious, </p>
<p>The Bountiful, the Provider, the Judge of all religions <br/>
Who has delivered me in time to save me <br/>
From being kept in the darkness of the grave. </p>
<p>CONDITIONS OF THE PLEDGE AT THE SECOND 'AQABA </p>
<p>When God gave permission to his apostle to fight, the second 'Aqaba con¬ <br/>
tained conditions involving war which were not in the first act of fealty. <br/>
Now they bound themselves to war against all and sundry for God and his <br/>
apostle, while he promised them for faithful service thus the reward of <br/>
paradise. </p>
<p>'Ubad^ b. al-Walld b. 'Ubada b. al-Samit from his father from his <br/>
grandfather 'Ubada b. al-Samit who was one of the Leaders told me, ‘We <br/>
pledged ourselves to war in complete obedience to the apostle in w'eal and <br/>
305 woe, in ease and hardship and evil circumstances; that we would not <br/>
wrong anyone; that we would speak the truth at all times; and that in <br/>
God’s service we would fear the censure of none.’ 'Ubada was one of the <br/>
twelve who gave his word at the first 'Aqaba. </p>

<p>The total number of those present at the second 'Aqaba from the Aus <br/>
and Khazraj was seventy-three men and two women who they allege <br/>

women; he merely stated the conditions, and if they accepted them he <br/>
would say, ‘Go, I have made a covenant with you.* </p>

of Habib and began to say to him, ‘Do you testify that Muhammad is the <br/>
apostle of God ?’ And when he said that he did, he went on, ‘And do you </p>
<p>313 testify that I am the apostle of God?* he answered, ‘I do not hear.’ So he <br/>
began to cut him to pieces member by member until he died. He tried <br/>
putting the same questions to him again and again, but he could get no <br/>
different answers. Nusayba went to al-Yamama with the Muslims and <br/>
took part in the war in person until God slew Musaylima, when she <br/>

<p>THE APOSTLE RECEIVES THE ORDER TO FIGHT </p>
<p>The apostle had not been given permission to fight or allowed to shed <br/>
blood before the second 'Aqaba. He had simply been ordered to call men <br/>
to God and to endure insult and forgive the ignorant. The Quraysh had <br/>
persecuted his followers, seducing some from their religion, and exiling <br/>
others from their country. They had to choose whether to give up their <br/>
religion, be maltreated at home, or to flee the country, some to Abyssinia, <br/>
others to Medina. </p>
<p>When Quraysh became insolent towards God and rejected His gracious <br/>
purpose, accused His prophet of lying, and ill treated and exiled those who <br/>
served Him and proclaimed His unity, believed in His prophet, and held <br/>
fast to His religion, He gave permission to His apostle to fight and to <br/>
protect himself against those who wronged them and treated them badly. </p>
<p>The first verse which was sent down on this subject from what I have <br/>
heard from 'Urwa b. al-Zubayr and other learned persons was: ‘Permis- </p>
<p>314 sion is given to those who fight because they have been wronged. God is <br/>
well able to help them,—those who have been driven out of their houses <br/>
without right only .because they said God is our Lord. Had not God used- </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 213 </p>
<p>some men to keep back others, cloisters and churches and oratories and <br/>
mosques wherein the name of God is constantly mentioned would have <br/>
been destroyed. Assuredly God will help those who help Him. God is <br/>
Almighty. Those who if we make them strong in the land with establish <br/>
prayer, pay the poor-tax, enjoin kindness, and forbid iniquity. To God <br/>
belongs the end of matters.<em> 1 The meaning is: ‘I have allowed them to <br/>
fight only because they have been unjustly treated while their sole offence <br/>
against men has been that they worship God. When they are in the ascen- <br/>
dant they will establish prayer, pay the poor-tax, enjoin kindness, and <br/>
forbid iniquity, i.e. the prophet and his companions all of them ’ Then <br/>
God sent down to him: ‘Fight them so that there be no more seduction,</em> 2 <br/>
ue. until no believer is seduced from his religion. ‘And the religion’is <br/>
God s , i.e. Until God alone is worshipped. </p>
<p>When God had given permission to fight and this clan of the Ansar <br/>
had pledged their support to him in Islam and to help him and his followers <br/>
and the Muslims who had taken refuge with them, the apostle commanded <br/>
his compamons, the emigrants of his people and those Muslims who were <br/>
with him in Mecca, to emigrate to Medina and to link up with their <br/>
brethren the Ansar. ‘God will make for you brethren and houses in which <br/>
you may be safe.’ So they went out in companies, and the apostle stayed <br/>
in Mecca waiting for his Lord’s permission to leave Mecca and migrate <br/>
to Medina. </p>
<p>THOSE WHO MIGRATED TO MEDINA </p>
<p>The first of the Quraysh to migrate to Medina from among the apostle’s <br/>
companions was one of B. Makhzum, Abu Salama b. 'Abdu’l-Asad b. <br/>
Hilal b. Abdullah b. 'Umar b. Makhzum whose forename was 'Abdullah <br/>
He went to Medina a year before the pledge at al-'Aqaba, having come to <br/>
the apostle m Mecca from Abyssinia. He migrated because the Quraysh <br/>
ill-treated him and he had heard that some of the Ansar had accepted <br/>
Islam. </p>
<p>My father Ishaq b. Yasar on the authority of Salama who had it from <br/>
his grandmother Umm Salama the prophet’s wife told me that she said- <br/>
When Abu Salama had decided to set out for Medina he saddled his camel <br/>
for me and mounted me on it together with my son Salama who was in <br/>
my arms. Then he set out leading the camel. When the men of B <br/>
al-Mughlra b. 'Abdullah b. 'Umar b. Makhzum saw him they got up and <br/>
said: ‘So far as you are concerned you can do what you like; but what <br/>
about your wife? Do you suppose that we shall let you take her away?’ <br/>
So they snatched the camel’s rope from his hand and took me from him. <br/>
Abu Salama’s family, the B. Abdu'l-Asad, were angry at this and said: <br/>
W e will not leave our son with her seeing you have torn her from our <br/>
tribesman.’ So they dragged at my little boy Salama between them until <br/>
1 SQra 22 ‘ 40 - 42 . * Sura 2. 198. </p>
<p>214 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>they dislocated his arm, and the B. al-Asad took him away, while the <br/>
B. al-Mughira kept me with them, and my husband Abu Salama went to <br/>
Medina. Thus I was separated from my husband and my son. I used to go <br/>
out every morning and sit in the valley weeping continuously until a year <br/>
or so had passed when one of my cousins of B. al-Mughira passed and saw <br/>
my plight and took pity on me. He said to his tribesmen, ‘Why don’t <br/>
you let this poor woman go ? You have separated husband, wife, and child.’ <br/>
So they said to me, ‘You can join your husband if you like’; and then the <br/>
B. 'Abdu’l-Asad restored my son to me. So I saddled my camel and took <br/>
my son and carried him in my arms. Then I set forth making for my hus¬ <br/>
band in Medina. Not a soul was with me. I thought that I could get food <br/>
from anyone I met on the road until I reached my husband. When I was in <br/>
Tan'lm 1 I met 'Uthman b. Talha b. Abu Talha, brother of B. 'Abdu’l- <br/>
Dar, who asked me where I was going and if I was all alone. I told him <br/>
that except for God and my little boy I was alone. He said that I ought <br/>
not to be left helpless like that and he took hold of the camel’s halter and <br/>
went along with me. Never have I met an Arab more noble than he. When <br/>
we halted he would make the camel kneel for me and then withdraw; <br/>
when we reached a stopping-place he would lead my camel £way, unload it, <br/>
and tie it to a tree. Then he would go from me and lie down under a tree. </p>
<p>316 When evening came he would bring the camel and saddle it, then go <br/>
behind me and tell me to ride; and when I was firmly established in the <br/>
saddle he would come and take the halter and lead it until he brought me <br/>
to a halt. This he did all the way to Medina. When he saw a village of <br/>
B. 'Amr b. 'Auf in Quba’ he said: ‘Your husband is in this village (Abu <br/>
Salama was actually there), so enter it with the blessing of God.’ Then <br/>
he went off on his way back to Mecca. </p>
<p>She used to say, By God, I do not know a family in Islam which suffered <br/>
what the family of Abu Salama did. 2 Nor have I ever seen a nobler man <br/>
than 'Uthman b. Talha. </p>
<p>The first emigrant to go to Medina after Abu Salama was 'Amir b. <br/>
Rabl'a, an ally of B. 'Adly b. Ka'b together with his wife Layla d. of <br/>
Idathma b. Ghanim b. 'Abdullah b. 'Auf b. 'Ubayd b, 'Uwayj b. 'Adly b. <br/>
Ka'b. Then 'Abdullah b. Jahsh b. Ri’ab b. Ya'mar b. Sabira b. Murra b. <br/>
Kathlr b. Ghanm b. Dudan b. Asad b. Khuzayma ally of B. Umayya b. <br/>
'Abdu Shams along with his family and his brother 'Abd—who was known <br/>
as Abu Ahmad. Now Abu Ahmad was blind and he used to go all round <br/>
Mecca from top to bottom without anyone to lead him. He 1 was a poet. <br/>
He had to wife al-Far'a d. of Abu Sufyan b. Harb; his mother was Umayma <br/>
d. of 'Abdu’l-Muttalib. </p>
<p>The house of the B. Jahsh was locked up when they left and 'Utba b. <br/>
Rabl'a and al-'Abbas b. 'Abdu’l-Muttalib and Abu Jahl b. Hisham passed </p>
<p>1 This place is said to be two parasangs, i.e. about six miles, from Mecca. </p>
<ul>
<li>The family was all but destroyed in the wars that followed; 'Uthman himself was killed <br/>

<p>'UMAR MIGRATES TO MEDINA. 'AYYASH AND HIS STORY </p>
<p>319 Then 'Umar b. al-Khattab and 'Ayyash b. Abu Rabi'a al-Makhzumi went <br/>
to Medina. Nafi', freedman of 'Abdullah b. 'Umar, told me that the latter <br/>
informed him that his father 'Umar said: ‘When we had made up our <br/>
minds to migrate to Medina 'Ayyash, Hisham b. al-'As b. Wa’il al-Sahmi, <br/>
and I made an appointment to meet at the thorn-trees of Adat of B. <br/>
Ghifar 2 above Sarif 3 and w^e said: “If one of us fails to turn up there in the <br/>
morning he will have been kept back by force and the other two must go <br/>
on.” 'Ayyash and I duly arrived there, but Hisham was kept back and <br/>
succumbed to the temptation to apostatize. </p>
<p>1 This seems to be an allusion to Sura 10. 29. </p>
<p>a About 10 miles from Mecca. From Yaq. i. 875. 13 al-Tana^ub would seem to be a place, <br/>
or at any rate a landmark, near by. 3 About 6 miles from Mecca. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 217 </p>
<p>‘When we reached Medina we stayed with B. 'Amr b. 'Auf in Quba’; <br/>
and Abu Jahl and al-Harith, sons of Hisham, came to 'Ayyash who was the <br/>
son of their uncle and their maternal brother, while the apostle was still <br/>
in Mecca. They told him that his mother had vowed that she would not <br/>
comb her head or take shelter from the sun until she saw him. He felt <br/>
sorry for her and I said to him, “This is nothing but an attempt of the <br/>
people to seduce you from your religion so bew'are of them; for by God <br/>
if lice were causing your mother trouble she w'ould use her comb, and if <br/>
the heat of Mecca oppressed her she would take shelter from it.” But <br/>
he said, “I will clear my mother from her oath; also I have some money <br/>
there which I can get.” I told him that I was one of the richest of the <br/>
Quraysh and he could have half my money if he refused to go with the <br/>
two men. But when I saw that he was determined to go I said, “If you <br/>
must go, then take this camel of mine. She is well bred and easy to ride. <br/>
Don’t dismount, and if you suspect them of treachery you can escape <br/>
on her.” </p>
<p>‘The three went off and while they were on their way Abu Jahl said, <br/>
“Nephew, I find my beast hard to ride. Won’t you mount me behind <br/>
you?” When he agreed he and they made their camels kneel to make the <br/>
change over, and when they were on the ground they fell on him and <br/>
bound him securely and brought him to Mecca and induced him to <br/>
apostatize.’ 3 2 ° </p>
<p>One of the family of 'Ayyash told me that they brought him in to Mecca <br/>
bound by day and said, ‘6 men of Mecca, deal with your fools as we have <br/>
dealt with this fool of ours.’ </p>
<p>To continue NafF’s story of 'Umar’s words: ‘We were saying God will <br/>
not receive compensation or ransom or repentance from those who let <br/>
themselves be made apostates—a people who know God and then return <br/>
to unbelief because of trial!’ And they were saying that of themselves. <br/>
When the apostle came to Medina God sent down concerning them and <br/>
what we had said and what they themselves thought: ‘Say: O my servants <br/>
who have acted foolishly against yourselves, despair not of God’s mercy, <br/>
for God forgiveth all sins. He is Forgiving Merciful. Turn to your Lord <br/>
and submit yourselves to Him before punishment comes to you, then <br/>
you will not be helped. Follow that excellent course which has been sent <br/>
down to you from your Lord before punishment comes to you suddenly <br/>
when you do not perceive it.’ 1 </p>
<p>I wrote these w r ords with my own hand on a sheet and sent it to Hisham, <br/>
and he said, ‘W'hen it came to me I read it in Dhu Tuwa, 2 bringing it near <br/>
and holding it at arms’ length and could make nothing of it until I said, </p>
<p>“O God, make me understand it!”. Then God put it into my heart that it <br/>
had been sent down concerning us and what we were thinking and what <br/>
was being said about us. So I returned to my camel and rejoined the <br/>
apostle who was then in Medina (264).’ </p>

<p>THE LODGEMENTS OF THE EMIGRANTS IN MEDINA </p>
<p>321 'Umar accompanied by various members of his family, and his brother <br/>
Zayd, and 'Amr and 'Abdullah the sons of Suraqa b. al-Mu'tamir, and <br/>
Khunays b. Hudhafa al-Sahmi (who had married 'Umar’s daughter <br/>
Hafsa whom the apostle married after the death of her husband), and <br/>
Waqid b. 'Abdullah al-Tamlml an ally of theirs, and Khaull and Malik <br/>
b. Abu Khaull, two allies (265), and four sons of al-Bukayr, namely <br/>
Iyas, 'Aqil, 'Amir, and Khalid; and their allies from B. Sa'd b. Layth; <br/>
when they arrived at Medina stayed with Rifa'a b. 'Abdu’l-Mundhir b. <br/>
Zanbar among B. 'Amr b. 'Auf in Quba’. 'Ayyash also stayed with him <br/>
when he came to Medina. </p>
<p>Then came successive waves of emigrants: Talha b. 'Ubayd Allah b. <br/>
'Uthman; Suhayb b. Sinan stayed with Khubayb b. Isaf brother of the B. <br/>
al-Harith b. al-Khazraj, in al-Sunh. 1 Others deny this and say that <br/>
Talha stayed with As'ad b. Zurara brother of the B. al-Najjar (266). </p>
<p>322 The following stayed with Kulthum b. Hidm brother of B. 'Amr b. <br/>
'Auf in Quba’'. Hamza b. 'Abdu’l-Muttalib; Zayd b. Haritha; Abu Mar- <br/>
thad Kannaz b. Hisn (267); and his son Marthad of the tribe GhanT, allies <br/>
of Hamza; Anasa; and Abu Kabsha, freedmen of the apostle. Other <br/>
reports are that they stayed with Sa'd b. Khaythama; and that Hamza <br/>
stayed with As'ad b. Zurara. </p>
<p>The following stayed with 'Abdullah b. Salama brother of the Banu <br/>
'Ajlan in Quba’: 'Ubayda b. al-Harith and his brother al-Tufayl; al- <br/>
Husayn b. al-Harith; Mistah b. Uthatha b. 'Abbad b. al-Muttalib; <br/>
Suwaybit b. Sa'd b. Huraymila brother of B. 'Abdu’l-I&gt;ar: Tulayb b. <br/>
'Umayr brother of the B. 'Abd b. Qusayy; and Khabbab, freedman of <br/>
'Utba b. Ghazwan. </p>
<p>With Sa'd b. al-Rabi' brother of the B. al-Harith b. al-Khazraj in the house <br/>
of the latter stayed 'Abdu’l-Rahman b. 'Auf with some male emigrants. </p>
<p>With Mundhir b. Muhammad b. 'Uqba b. Uhayha b. al-julah in <br/>
al-'Usba the dwelling of the B. Jahjaba, stayed al-Zubayr b. al-'Awwam <br/>
and Abu Sabra b. Abu Ruhm b. 'Abdu’l-'Uzza. </p>
<p>With Sa'd b. Mu'adh b. al-Nu'man brother of the B. 'Abdu’l-Ashhal in <br/>
their dwelling stayed Mus'ab b. 'Umayr b. Hashim brother of the B. <br/>
'Abdu’l-Dar. </p>
<p>323 With 'Abbad b. Bishr b. Waqsh brother of the B. 'Abdu’l-Ashhal in <br/>
the latter’s dwelling stayed Abu Hudhayfa b. 'Utba b. Rabl'a and his <br/>
freedman Salim; and 'Utba b. Ghazwan b. Jabir (268). </p>
<p>With Aus b. Thabit b. al-Mundhir, brother of Hassan b. Thabit in the <br/>
dwelling of B. al-Najjar stayed 'Uthman b. 'Affan. This was the reason why <br/>
Hassan was so fond of 'Uthman and lamented him when he was slain. </p>
<p>It is said that the celibate emigrants stayed with Sa'd b. Khaythama <br/>
because he himself was unmarried; but God knows best about that. </p>

THE CONQUEST OF ARABIA <br/>
THE DEATH OF THE PROPHET </p>
<p>THE HIJRA OF THE PROPHET </p>
<p>After his companions had left, the apostle stayed in Mecca waiting for <br/>
permission to migrate. Except for Abu Bakr and 'All, none of his supporters <br/>
were left but those under restraint and those who had been forced to aposta¬ <br/>
tize. The former kept asking the apostle for permission to emigrate and <br/>
he would answ'er, ‘Don’t be in a hurry; it may be that God will give you <br/>
a companion.’ Abu Bakr hoped that it would be Muhammad himself. </p>
<p>When the Quraysh saw that the apostle had a party and companions <br/>
not of their tribe and outside their territory, and that his companions <br/>
had migrated to join them, and knew that they had settled in a new home <br/>
and had gained protectors, they feared that the apostle might join them, <br/>
since they knew that he had decided to fight them. So they assembled <br/>
in their council chamber, the house of Qusayy b. Kilab where all their <br/>
important business was conducted, to take counsel what they should do in <br/>
regard to the apostle, for they were now in fear of him. </p>
<p>One of our companions whom I have no reason to doubt told me on the <br/>
authority of ‘Abdullah b. Abu Najlh from Mujahid b. Jubayr father of <br/>
al-Hajjaj; and another person of the same character on the authority of 324 <br/>
‘Abdullah b. ‘Abbas told me that when they had fixed a day to come to a <br/>
decision about the apostle, on the morning of that very day which was <br/>
called the day of al-Zahma the devil came to them in the form of a hand¬ <br/>
some old man clad in a mantle and stood at the door of the house. When <br/>
they saw him standing there they asked him who he was and he told them <br/>
that he was a shaykh from the highlands who had heard of their intention <br/>
and had come to hear what they had to say and perhaps to give them <br/>
counsel and advice. He was invited to enter and there he found the <br/>
leaders of Quraysh. From B. 'Abdu Shams were ‘Utba and Shayba sons <br/>
of Rabi‘a; and Abu Sufyan. From B. Naufal b. ‘Abdu Manaf Tu'ayma <br/>
b. ‘Adiy; Jubayr b. Mut‘im; and al-Harith b. 'Amir b. Naufal. From B. <br/>
'Abdu’l-Dar al-Nadr b. al-Harith b. Kalada. From B. Asad b. 'Abdu’l- <br/>
'Uzza Abu’l-Bakhtarl b. Hisham and Zam'a b. al-Aswad b. al-Muttalib; <br/>
and Hakim b. Hizam. From B. Makhzum Abu Jahl b. Hisham. From <br/>
B. Sahm Nubayh and Munabbih the sons of al-Hajjaj. From B. Jumah <br/>
Umayya b. Khalaf, and others including some who were not of Quraysh. </p>
<p>The discussion opened with the statement that now that Muhammad <br/>
had gained adherents outside the tribe they were no longer safe against <br/>
a sudden attack and the meeting was to determine the best course to <br/>
pursue. One advised that they should put him in irons behind bars and <br/>
then wait until the same Tate overtook him as befell his like, the poets <br/>
Zuhayr and Nabigha, and others. The shaykh objected to this on the <br/>
ground that news would leak out that he was imprisoned, and immediately <br/>
his followers would attack and snatch him away; then their numbers <br/>
would so grow that they would destroy the authority of Quraysh altogether. </p>
<p>222 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>325 They must think of another plan. Another man suggested that they should <br/>
drive him out of the country. They did not care where he went or what <br/>
happened to him once he was out of sight and they were rid of him. They <br/>
could then restore their social life to its former state. Again the shaykh <br/>
objected that it was not a good plan. His fine speech and beautiful diction <br/>
and the compelling force of his message were such that if he settled with <br/>
some Beduin tribe he would win them over so that they would follow him <br/>
and come and attack them in their land and rob them of their position and <br/>
authority and then he could do what he liked with them. They must <br/>
think of a better plan. </p>
<p>Thereupon Abu Jahl said that he had a plan which had not been <br/>
suggested hitherto, namely that each clan should provide a young, power¬ <br/>
ful, well-born, aristocratic warrior; that each of these should be provided <br/>
with a sharp sword; then that each of them should strike a blow at him <br/>
and kill him. Thus they would be relieved of him, and responsibility <br/>
for his blood would lie upon all the clans. The B. 'Abdu Manaf could not <br/>
fight them all and would have to accept the blood-money which they <br/>
would all contribute to. The shaykh exclaimed: ‘The man is right. <br/>
In my opinion it is the only thing to do.’ Having come to a decision the <br/>
people dispersed. </p>
<p>Then Gabriel came to the apostle and said: ‘Do not sleep tonight on the <br/>
bed on which you usually sleep.’ Before much of the night had passed <br/>
they assembled at his door waiting for him to go to sleep so that they <br/>
might fall upon him. When the apostle saw what they were doing he <br/>
told r AB to He on his bed and to wrap himself in his green Had rami <br/>
mantle; for no harm would befall him. He himself used to sleep in this </p>
<p>326 mantle. </p>
<p>Yazid b. Ziyad on the authority of Muhammad b. Ka r b. al-QurazI told <br/>
me that when they were all outside his door Abu Jahl said to them: <br/>
‘Muhammad alleges that if you follow him you will be kings of the Arabs <br/>
and the Persians. 'Then after death you will be raised to gardens like those <br/>
of the Jordan. But if you do not follow him you will be slaughtered, and <br/>
when you are raised from the dead you will be burned in the fire of hell.’ <br/>
The apostle came out to them with a handful of dust saying: ‘I do say <br/>
that. You are one of them.’ God took away their sight so that they could <br/>
not see him and he began to sprinkle the dust on their heads as he recited <br/>
these verses: ‘Ya Sin, by the wise Quran. Thou art of those that art sent <br/>
on a straight path, a revelation of the Mighty the Merciful’ as far as the <br/>
words ‘And we covered them and they could not see’. 1 When he had <br/>
finished reciting not one of them but had dust upon his head. Then he <br/>
went wherever he ’wanted to go and someone not of their company came <br/>
up and asked them what they were waiting for there. When they said <br/>
that they were waiting for Muhammad he said: ‘ But good heavens Muham¬ <br/>
mad came out to you and put dust on the head of every single man of you </p>
<p>1 Sura 36. 1-8. </p>
<p>223 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>and then went off on his ow n affairs. C an t you sec what has happened <br/>
to you?’ They put up their hands and felt the dust on their heads. Then <br/>
they began to search and saw 7 'All on the bed wrapped in the apostle’s <br/>
mantle and said, By God it is Muhammad sleeping in lus mantle.’ Thus <br/>
they remained until the morning when 'All rose from the bed and then <br/>
they realized that the man had told them the truth. </p>
<p>Among the verses of the Quran which God sent down about that day <br/>
and what they had agreed upon are: ‘And when the unbelievers plot to <br/>
shut thee up or to kill thee or to drive thee out they plot, but God plots <br/>
also, and God is the best of plotters’; 1 and ‘Or they say he is a poet for <br/>
whom wc may expect the misfortune of fate. Say: Go on expecting for <br/>
I am witli you among the expectant’ (269).- </p>
<p>It was then that God gave permission to his prophet to migrate. Now 327 <br/>
Abu Bakr was a man of means, and at the time that he asked the apostle’s <br/>
permission to migrate and he replied ‘Do not hurry; perhaps God will <br/>
give you a companion,’ hoping that the apostle meant himself he bought <br/>
two camels and kept them tied up in his house supplying them with fodder <br/>
in preparation for departure. </p>
<p>A man whom I have no reason to doubt told me as from 'Urwa b. al- <br/>
Zubayr that 'A’isha said: The apostle used to go to Abu Bakr’s house <br/>
every' day either in the eaily morning or at night; but on the day when he <br/>
was given permission to migrate from Mecca he came to us at noon, an <br/>
hour at w'hich he was not wont to come. As soon as he saw him Abu Bakr <br/>
realized that something had happened to bring him at this hour. When <br/>
he came in Abu Bakr gave up his seat to him. Only my sister Asma’ <br/>
and I were there and the apostle asked him to send us away'. ‘But they <br/>
are my two daughters and they can do no harm, may my father and my <br/>
mother be your ransom, said Abu Bakr. ‘God has given me permission <br/>
to depart and migrate,’ he answered. ‘Together?’’ asked Abu Bakr. <br/>
Together, he replied. And by God before that day I had never seen <br/>
anyone weep for joy as Abu Bakr wept then. At last he said, ‘O prophet <br/>
of God, these arc the two camels which I have held in readiness for this.’ 328 <br/>
Bo they hired 'Abdullah b. Arqat, a man of B. ’I-Di’l b. Bakr whose mother <br/>
was a woman of B. Sahm b. Amr, and a polytheist to lead them on the <br/>
way, and they handed over to him their two camels and he kept them and <br/>
fed them until the appointed day came. 3 </p>
<ul>
<li>SQra 8 - 30 . 2 Sura S 2. 30. </li>
</ul>
<p>At this point in Suhayli’s commentary (ii, p. 2 ) there is a note of considerable impor¬ <br/>
tance in the light it throws on the textual tradition of our author, ft runs thus: Ibn Ishaq <br/>
said (in a narration which does not come via Ibn Hisham) in a long, sound, tradition which <br/>
} have shortened that when Abu Bakr migrated with the apostle he left his daughters behind <br/>
in Mecca. When they got to Medina the apostle sent Zayd b. I.Iaritha and Abu Raff' his <br/>
freedman; and Abu Bakr sent 'Abdullah b. Uravqit together with 500 dirhems with which <br/>
they bought a mount in Qudayd. Arrived at Mecca they brought away Sauda d of Zama'a <br/>
and Fatima and Umm Kulthurn. 'A’isha said: My mother came out with them and Talha <br/>
b. UbaydaMah travelling together; and when we were in Qudavd the camel on whUh my <br/>
mother Umm Ruman and I were riding in a litter, bolted, and my mother began to c ry <br/>
Alas, my daughter, alas my husband! In the tradition of Yunus from Ibn Ishaq there is </p>
<p>224 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>According to what I have been told none knew when the apostle left <br/>
except 'All and Abu Bakr and the latter’s family. I have heard that the <br/>
apostle told 'All about his departure and ordered him to stay behind in <br/>
Mecca in order to return goods which men had deposited with the apostle; <br/>
for anyone in Mecca who had property which he was anxious about left it <br/>
with him because of his notorious honesty and trustworthiness. </p>
<p>When the apostle decided to go he came to Abu Bakr and the two of <br/>
them left by a window in the back of the latter’s house and made for a <br/>
cave on Thaur, a mountain below Mecca. Having entered, Abu Bakr <br/>
329 ordered his son 'Abdullah to listen to what people were saying and to <br/>
come to them by night with the day’s news. He also ordered 'Amir b. <br/>
Fuhayra, his freedman, to feed his flock by day and to bring them to them <br/>
in the evening in the cave. Asma’ his daughter used to come at night with <br/>
food to sustain them (270). </p>
<p>The two of them stayed in the cave for three days. When Quraysh <br/>
missed the apostle they offered a hundred she-camels to anyone who <br/>
would bring him back. During the day 'Abdullah was listening to their <br/>
plans and conversation and w'ould come at night with the news. 'Amir <br/>
used to pasture his flock with the shepherds of Mecca and when night <br/>
fell would bring them to the cave where they milked them and slaughtered <br/>
some. When 'Abdullah left them in the morning to go to Mecca, 'Amir <br/>
would take the sheep over the same route to cover his tracks. When the <br/>
three days had passed and men’s interest waned, the man they had hired <br/>
came with their camels and one of his own. Asma’ came too with a bag <br/>
of provisions; but she had forgotten to bring a rope, so that when they <br/>
started she could not tie the bag on the camel. Thereupon she undid her <br/>
girdle and using it as a rope tied the bag to the saddle. For this reason <br/>
she got the name ‘She of the girdle’ (271). </p>
<p>When Abu Bakr brought the two camels to the apostle he offered the <br/>
better one to him and invited him to ride her. But the apostle refused to <br/>
ride an animal which was not his own and when Abu Bakr wanted to give <br/>
him it he demanded to know what he had paid for it and bought it from <br/>
him. They rode off, and Abu Bakr carried 'Amir his freedman behind him <br/>
to act as a servant on the journey. </p>
<p>I was told that Asma’ said, ‘When the apostle and Abu Bakr had gone, <br/>
a number of Quraysh including Abu Jahl came to us and stood at the door. <br/>
When I went out to them they asked where my father was and when I <br/>
said that I did not know Abu Jahl, w r ho w r as a rough dissolute man, <br/>
33 ° slapped my face so violently that my earring flew off. Then they took <br/>
themselves off and we remained for three days without news until a man </p>
<p>mention of this hadith. In it 'A’isha said ‘I heard a voice but could see no one , . and she <br/>
goes on to describe how they came to Medina and found the apostle building a mosque and <br/>
houses for himself. ‘I stayed with Abu Bakr’s family and Sauda in her own house, and Abu <br/>
Bakr asked the apostle if he would not build for his family, and when he said that he would <br/>
if he had the money Abu Bakr gave him 12 okes and 20 dirhems.’ This tradition from <br/>
'A’isha comes via Ibn Abu’l-Zinad from Hisham b. 'Urwa from his father. </p>

<p>he stumbled and threw me. I thought this was somewhat unusual so <br/>
I resorted to the divining arrows again and out came the detestable “Do <br/>
him no harm/’ But I refused to be put off and rode on in pursuit. Again <br/>
my horse stumbled and threw me, and again I tried the arrows with the <br/>
same result. 1 I rode on, and at last as I saw the little band my horse <br/>
stumbled with me and its forelegs went into the ground and I fell. Then <br/>
as it got its legs out of the ground smoke arose like a sandstorm. When </p>
<p>332 I saw that I knew that he was protected against me and would have the <br/>
upper hand. I called to them saying who I was and asking them to wait <br/>
for me; and that they need have no concern, for no harm would come to <br/>
them from me. The apostle told Abu Bakr to ask what I wanted and I said, <br/>
“Write a document for me which will be a sign between you and me” <br/>
and the apostle instructed Abu Bakr to do so. </p>
<p>‘He wrote it on a bone, or a piece of paper, or a potsherd and threw it to <br/>
me and I put it in my quiver and went back. I kept quiet about the whole <br/>
affair until when the apostle conquered Mecca and finished with al-Ta’if and <br/>
flunayn I went out to give him the document and I met him in al-Ji'rana. 2 </p>
<p>‘I got among a squadron of the Ansar cavalry and they began to beat <br/>
me with their spears, saying, “Be off with you; what on earth do you want ?” <br/>
However, I got near to the apostle as he sat on his camel and his shank <br/>
in his stirrup looked to me like the trunk of a palm-tree. I lifted my hand <br/>
with the document, saying what it was and what my name was. He said “It <br/>
is a day of repaying and goodness. Let him come near.” So I approached <br/>
him and accepted Islam. Then I remembered something that I wanted <br/>
to ask him. All I can remember now is that I said “Stray camels used to <br/>
come to my cistern which I kept full for my own camels. Shall I get a <br/>
reward for having let them have water?” “Yes,” he said, “for watering <br/>
every thirsty creature there is a reward.” Then I returned to my people <br/>
and brought my alms to the apostle' (274). </p>
<p>Their guide, 'Abdullah b. Arqat, took them below Mecca; then along </p>
<p>333 the shore until he crossed the road below 'Usfan; then below Amaj; then <br/>
after passing Qudayd by way of al-Kharrar and Thaniyyatu'l-Marra to <br/>
Liqf(275). </p>
<p>He took them past the waterhole of Liqf, then down to Madlajatu <br/>

al-Ajrad, then DhQ Salam of the valley of A'dS’, the waterhole of Ta'hin, <br/>
then by al-'Ababid (278), then by way of al-FSjja (279). Then he took <br/>
them down to al-*Arj; and one of their mounts having dropped behind, <br/>
a man of Aslam, Aus b. liujr by name, took the prophet to Medina on his <br/>
camel which was called Ibn al-Rida’, sending with him a servant called </p>

<p>Muhammad b. Ja'far b. al-Zubayr from 'Urwa b. al-Zubayr from <br/>
Abdu 1-Rahman b. 'Uwaymir b. Sa'ida told me, saying, ‘Men of my tribe <br/>
who were the apostle’s companions told me, “When we heard that the <br/>
apostle had left Mecca and we were eagerly expecting his arrival we used 334 <br/>
to go out after morning prayers to our lava tract beyond our land to await <br/>
him. This we did until there was no more shade left and then we went <br/>
indoors in the hot season. On the day that the apostle arrived we had sat <br/>
as we always had until there being no more shade we went indoors and <br/>
then the apostle arrived. The first to see him was a Jew. He had seen what <br/>
we were in the habit of doing and that we were expecting the arrival of <br/>
the apostle and he called out at the top of his voice ‘O Banu Qayla your <br/>
!uck has cornel’ So we went out to greet the apostle who was in the <br/>
shadow of a palm-tree with Abu Bakr who was of like age. Now most </p>
<p>US , h , ad n&lt; T ver seen the a P ostle and as the people crowded round him <br/>
they did not know him from Abu Bakr until the shade left him and Abu </p>
<p>Bakr got up with his mantle and shielded him from the sun, and then we <br/>
knew. 1 </p>
<p>The apostle, so they say, stayed with Kulthum b. Hidm brother of the <br/>
■ mr b - Anyone of the B. 'Ubayd. Others say he stayed with Sa'd <br/>
b. Khaythama. Those who assert the former say that it was only because he <br/>
left Kulthum to go and sit with the men in Sa'd’s house (for he was a <br/>
bachelor and housed the apostle’s companions who were bachelors) that <br/>
it is said that he stayed with Sa'd, for his house used to be called the house <br/>
of the^ bachelors. But God knows the truth of the matter. </p>
<p>Abu Bakr stayed with Khubayb b. Isaf, one of the B. al-Harith b. al- <br/>
Khazraj in al-Sunh. Some say it was with Kharija b. Zayd b. Abu Zuhavr <br/>
brother of the B. al-Harith. J ’ </p>

and he noticed that a man used to come to her in the middle of the night <br/>
and knock on her door; she would come out and he would give her some- <br/>
thmg. He felt very suspicious of him and asked her what wfs the meaning <br/>
ot th.s nightly performance as she was a Muslim woman without a husband <br/>

<p>bring her the pieces to use as fuel. 'All used to talk of this incident until <br/>
Sahl died in Iraq while he was w'ith him. Hind b. Sa'd b. Sahl b. Hunayf <br/>
told me this story from what 'All said. </p>
<p>The apostle stayed in Quba’ among B. 'Amr b. 'Auf from Monday to <br/>
Thursday and then he laid the foundation of his mosque. Then God <br/>
brought him out from them on the Friday. The B. 'Amr allege that he <br/>
stayed longer wdth them, and God knows the truth of the matter. Friday <br/>
prayer found the apostle among B. Salim b. 'Auf and he prayed it in the <br/>
mosque which is in the bottom of the Wadi Ranunah This was the first <br/>
Friday prayer that he prayed in Medina. </p>
<p>Ttban b. Malik and 'Abbas b. 'Ubada b. Nadia with some of B. Salim <br/>
b. 'Auf came and asked him to live with them and enjoy their wealth and <br/>
protection, but he said, ‘Let her go her way/ for his camel was under <br/>
God’s orders; so they let her go until she came to the home of B. Bayada, <br/>
where he was met by Ziyad b. Labid and Farwa b. 'Amr with some of their <br/>
clansmen. They gave the same invitation and met with the same reply. <br/>
The same thing happened with B. Sa'ida when Sa'd b. 'Ubada and </p>
<p>336 al-Mundhir b. 'Amr invited him to stay; and with B. ’l-Harith b. al- <br/>
Khazraj represented by Sa'd b. al-Rabl' and Kharija b. Zayd and 'Abdullah <br/>
b. Rawaha; and with B. 'Adly b. al-Najjar (who were his nearest maternal <br/>
relatives the mother of 'Abdu’l-Muttalib Salma d. 'Amr being one of their <br/>
women), being represented by Salit b. Qays and Abu Salit and Usayra b. <br/>
Abu Kharija. Finally the camel came to the home of B. Malik b. al-Najjar <br/>
when it knelt at the door of his mosque, which at that time was used as a <br/>
drying-place for dates and belonged to two young orphans of B. al-Najjar <br/>
of B. Malik clan, who were under the protection of Mu'adh. b. ‘Afra <br/>
Sahl and Suhayl the sons of 'Amr. W r hen it knelt the apostle did not alight, <br/>
and it got up and went a short distance. The apostle left its rein free, not <br/>
guiding it, and it turned in its tracks and returned to the place where it had <br/>
knelt at first and knelt there again. It shook itself and lay exhausted with <br/>
its chest upon the ground. The apostle alighted and Abu Ayyub Khalid b. <br/>
Zayd took his baggage into the house (T. The Ansar invited him to stay with <br/>
them, but he said ‘A man (stays) with his baggage) 1 and the apostle stayed <br/>
with him. When he asked to whom the date-store belonged Mu'adh b. </p>
<p>' Afra’ told him that the owners were Sahl and Suhayl the sons of 'Amr who <br/>
were orphans in his care and that he could take it for a mosque and he <br/>
would pay the young men for it. </p>
<p>337 The apostle ordered that a mosque should be built, and he stayed with <br/>
Abu Ayyub until the mosque and his houses were completed. The <br/>
apostle joined in the work to encourage the Muslims to work and the <br/>
muhdjirin and the ansar laboured hard. One of the Muslims rhymed: </p>
<p>If we sat down while the prophet worked <br/>
It could be said that we had shirked. </p>
<p>1 T. 1259. 7. </p>
<p>229 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad <br/>
As they built, the Muslims sang a rajaz verse: </p>
<p>There’s no life but the life of the next world. </p>
<p>O God, have mercy on the ansar and the muhajira (281). </p>
<p>The apostle used to sing it in the form </p>
<p>1 here’s no life but the life of the next world. </p>
<p>O God, have mercy on the muhajirin and the ansar. 1 </p>
<p>Ammar b. Yasir came in when they had overloaded him with bricks <br/>
saying I hey are killing me. They load me wnh burdens they cand <br/>
carry themselves. Umm Salama the prophet’s wife said: I saw the <br/>

<p>All composed a rajaz verse on that day: </p>
<p>There s one that labours night and day <br/>
To build us mosques of brick and clay <br/>
And one who turns from dust away! (282.) </p>
<p>And Ammar learned it and began to chant it </p>
<p>When he persisted in it one of the prophet’s companions thought that </p>

He said. I have heard what you have been saying for a long time O </p>
<p>.bn Sumayya, and by God I think I’ll hit you on the nose!’ Now he had a <br/>
sick in his hand and the apostle was angry and said, 'What is wrong <br/>
between them and 'Ammar? He invites them to Paradise while they <br/>
invite him to hell. Ammar is as dear to me as my own face. If a man <br/>
behaves like this he will not be forgiven, so avoid him ’ </p>

and you below me. So leave your present quarters and exchange places <br/>
with us.” He replied: “O Abu Ayyub, it is more convenient for me and <br/>
my guests that we should be on the ground floor of the house.” So we <br/>
remained as we were. Once we broke ajar of water and Umm Ayyub and <br/>
I took one of our garments to mop up the water in fear that it would drop <br/>
on the apostle and cause him annoyance. We had no cloth which we could <br/>
use. </p>
<p>‘We used to prepare his evening meal and send it to him. When he <br/>
returned w'hat was left, Umm Ayyub and I used to touch the spot where <br/>
his hand had rested and eat from that in the hope of gaining a blessing. <br/>
One night we prepared for him onions or garlic and the apostle returned it <br/>
and I saw no mark of his hand in it. I went to him in some anxiety to tell <br/>
him of our practice and that this time there was no mark of his hand, and <br/>
he replied that he had perceived the smell of the vegetables and he was a <br/>
man who had to speak confidentially to people but that we should eat them. <br/>
So we ate the dish and never sent him onions again.’ </p>
<p>339 The emigrants followed one another to join the apostle, and none was <br/>
left in Mecca but those who had apostatized or been detained. Whole <br/>
families with their property did not come together except the B. Maz'un <br/>
from B. Jumah; the B. Jahsh b. Ri’ab, allies of B. Umayya; and the B. <br/>
Bukayr from B. Sa'd b. Layth, allies of B. 'Adly b. ICa'b. Their houses in <br/>
Mecca were locked up when they migrated, leaving no inhabitant. </p>
<p>When the B. Jahsh gave up their house Abu Sufyan went and sold it to <br/>
'Amr b. 'Alqama brother of B. 'Amir b. Lu’ayy. When the owners heard <br/>
of this 'Abdullah b. Jahsh told the apostle of it, and he replied: ‘Are you <br/>
not pleased that God will give you a better house in Paradise?’ And when <br/>
he answered Yes, he said, ‘Then you have it.’ When the apostle got <br/>
possession of Mecca Abu Ahmad spoke to him about their house; and the <br/>
apostle delayed his reply. People said to him, ‘The apostle dislikes your <br/>
reopening the question of your property which you lost in God’s service, <br/>
so don’t speak to him about it again.’ Abu Ahmad said in reference to <br/>
Abu Sufyan: </p>
<p>Tell Abu Sufyan of a matter he will live to regret. </p>
<p>You sold your cousin’s house to pay a debt you owed. </p>
<p>Your ally by God the Lord of men swears an oath: </p>
<p>Take it, Take it, may [your treachery] cling to you like the ring of the <br/>
dove. </p>
<p>The apostle stayed in Medina from the month of Rabl'u’l-awwal to <br/>
Safar of the following year until his mosque and his quarters were built. <br/>
This tribe of the Ansar all accepted Islam and every house of the Ansar </p>
<p>340 accepted Islam except Khatma, Waqif, Wa’il, and Umayya who were the <br/>
Aus Allah, a dan of Aus who clung to their heathenism. </p>
<p>The fiist address which the apostle gave according to what I heard on the </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 2 ^i </p>
<p>authority of Abu Salama b. 'Abdu’l-Rahman—God save me from attri¬ <br/>
buting to the apostle words which he did not say—was as follows: he <br/>
praised and glorified God as was His due and then said: O men, send <br/>
forward (good works) for yourselves. You know, by God, that one of <br/>
you may be smitten and will leave his flock without a shepherd. Then his <br/>
Lord will say to him—there will be no interpreter or chamberlain to veil <br/>
him from Him—Did not My apostle come to you with a message, and did <br/>
not I give you wealth and show- you favour? What have you sent forward <br/>
for yourself. Then wall he look to right and left and see nothing; he will <br/>
00k in front of him and see nothing but hell. He who can shield his face <br/>
from the fire even with a little piece of date let him do so; and he who <br/>
cannot find that then with a good word; for the good deed will be rewarded <br/>
tenfold yea to twice seven hundred fold. 1 Peace be upon you and God’s <br/>
mercy and blessing. </p>
<p>Then the apostle preached on another occasion as follows: Praise <br/>
belongs to God whom I praise and whose aid I implore. We take refuge in <br/>
God from our own sins and from the evil of our acts. He whom God <br/>
guides none can lead astray; and whom Me leads astray none can guide. </p>
<p>I testify that there is no God but He alone, He is without companion The <br/>
finest speech is the Book of God. He to whom God has made it seem <br/>
glorious and made him enter Islam after unbelief, who has chosen it above <br/>
all other speech of men, doth prosper. It is the finest speech and the most <br/>
penetrating. Love what God loves. Love God with all your hearts, and <br/>
weary not of the word of God and its mention. Harden not your hearts <br/>
from it. Out of everything that God creates He chooses and selects; the <br/>
actions He chooses He calls khira ; the people He chooses He calls mustaftv <br/>
and the speech He chooses He calls sdlih. From everything that is brought <br/>
to man there is the lawful and the unlawful. Worship God and associate 3 <br/>
naught with Him; fear Him as He ought to be feared; Carry out loyally <br/>
towards God what you say with your mouths. Love one another in the </p>
<p>spirit of God. Verily God is angry when His covenant is broken. Peace <br/>
be upon you. </p>
<p>THE COVENANT BETWEEN THE MUSLIMS AND THE <br/>
MED IN AN S AND WITH THE JEWS </p>
<p>The apostle wrote a document concerning the emigrants and the helpers <br/>
in which he made a friendly agreement with the Jews and established them <br/>
m their religion and their property, and stated the reciprocal obligations, <br/>
as follows: In the name of God the Compassionate, the Merciful. This is a <br/>
document from Muhammad the prophet [governing the relations] between <br/>
the believers and Muslims of Quraysh and Yathrib, and those who </p>
<p>1, . . V, r .nit rest 01 xne sermon* there is an </p>
<p>allusion to the Quran. Cf. 34. 36 where commentators differ as to the exact meaning of A'/. </p>
<p>232 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>followed them and joined them and laboured with them. They are one <br/>
community ( umma ) to the exclusion of all men. The Quraysh emigrants <br/>
according to their present custom shall pay the bloodwit within their <br/>
number and shall redeem their prisoners with the kindness and justice <br/>
common among believers. </p>
<p>The B. 'Auf according to their present custom shall pay the bloodwit <br/>
they paid in heathenism; every section shall redeem its prisoners with the <br/>
kindness and justice common among believers. The B. Sa'ida, the B. <br/>
’ 1 -Harith, and the B. Jusham, and the B. al-Najjar likewise. 1 </p>
<p>The B. 'Amr b. 'Auf, the B. al-Nablt and the B. al-'Aus likewise. 2 </p>
<p>Believers shall not leave anyone destitute among them by not paying <br/>
342 his redemption money or bloodwit in kindness (283). </p>
<p>A believer shall not take as an ally the freedman of another Muslim <br/>
against him. The God-fearing believers shall be against the rebellious or <br/>
him who seeks to spread injustice, or sin or enmity, or corruption between <br/>
believers; the hand of every man shall be against him even if he be a son <br/>
of one of them. A believer shall not slay a believer for the sake of an <br/>
unbeliever, nor shall he aid an unbeliever against a believer. God’s pro¬ <br/>
tection is one, the least of them may give protection to a stranger on their <br/>
behalf. Believers are friends one to the other to the exclusion of outsiders. <br/>
To the Jew' who follows us belong help and equality. He shall not be <br/>
WTonged nor shall his enemies be aided. The peace of the believers is <br/>
indivisible. No separate peace shall be made ’when believers are fighting <br/>
in the way of God. Conditions must be fair and equitable to all. In every <br/>
foray a rider must take another behind him. The believers must avenge <br/>
the blood of one another shed in the way of God. The God-fearing <br/>
believers enjoy the best and most upright guidance. No polytheist 3 shall <br/>
take the property or person of Quraysh under his protection nor shall he <br/>
intervene against a believer. Whosoever is convicted of killing a believer <br/>
without good reason shall be subject to retaliation unless the next of kin <br/>
is satisfied (with blood-money), and the believers shall be against him as <br/>
one man, and they are bound to take action against him. </p>
<p>It shall not be law'ful to a believer who holds by what is in this document <br/>
and believes in God and the last day to help an evil-doer 4 or to shelter him. <br/>
The curse of God and His anger on the day of resurrection will be upon <br/>
him if he docs, and neither repentance nor ransom 5 will be received from <br/>
him. Whenever you differ about a matter it must be referred to God and <br/>
to Muhammad. </p>
<p>The Jews shall contribute to the cost of war so long as they are fighting </p>
<p>1 These all belong to al-Khazraj. 2 These all belong to al-Aus. </p>
<ul>
<li>1 Presumably the heathen Arabs of Medina are referred to. </li>
</ul>
<p>4 Muhdith. Commentators do not explain this word and it is somewhat obscure. Possibly </p>
<p>it means ‘adulterer’ here, though a wider meaning suits the context better. Cf. \V. 690. </p>
<p>5 See Lane, 16820. Originally the phrase referred to the bloodwit. Sarf meant compensa¬ <br/>
tion and 'adl the slaying of a man in revenge. Finally it came to mean anything excessive, <br/>
so that here it would be sufficient to say ‘no excuse would be received from him’. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 233 </p>
<p>alongside the believers. The Jew's of the B. 'Auf are one community with <br/>
the believers (the Jews have their religion and the Muslims have theirs), <br/>
their freedmen and their persons except those who behave unjustly and <br/>
sinfully, for they hurt but themselves and their families. The same applies <br/>
to the Jews of the B. al-Najjar, B. al-Harith, B. Sa'ida, B. Jusham, B. 343 <br/>
al-Aus, B. Tha'laba, and the Jafna, a clan of the Tha'laba and the B. <br/>
al-Shutayba. Loyalty is a protection against treachery. 1 The freedmen of <br/>
Tha'laba are as themselves. The close friends 2 of the Jews are as themselves. <br/>
None of them shall go out to war save with the permission of Muhammad, <br/>
but he shall not be prevented from taking revenge for a wound. He who <br/>
slays a man without warning slays himself and his household, unless it be <br/>
one who has wronged him, for God will accept that. The Jews must bear <br/>
their expenses and the Muslims their expenses. Each must help the other <br/>
against anyone who attacks the people of this document. They must seek <br/>
mutual advice and consultation, and loyalty is a protection against treachery. </p>
<p>A man is not liable for his ally’s misdeeds. The wronged must be helped. </p>
<p>The Jews must pay with the believers so long as war lasts. Yathrib shall <br/>
be a sanctuary for the people of this document. A stranger under pro¬ <br/>
tection shall be as his host doing no harm and committing no crime. A <br/>
woman shall only be given protection with the consent of her family. If <br/>
any dispute or controversy likely to cause trouble should arise it must be <br/>
referred to God and to Muhammad the apostle of God. God accepts <br/>
what is nearest to piety and goodness in this document. Quraysh and their <br/>
helpers shall not be given protection. The contracting parties are bound <br/>
to help one another against any attack on Yathrib. If they are called to <br/>
make peace and maintain it they must do so; and if they make a similar <br/>
demand on the Muslims it must be carried out except in the case of a <br/>
holy war. Every one shall have his portion from the side to which he <br/>
belongs; 3 the Jews of al-Aus, their freedmen and themselves have the <br/>
same standing with the people of this document in pure loyalty from the <br/>
people of this document (284). </p>
<p>Loyalty is a protection against treachery: He who acquires aught 8 14 <br/>
acquires it for himself. God approves of this document. This deed will <br/>
not protect 4 the unjust and the sinner. The man who goes forth to light <br/>
and the man who stays at home in the city 5 is sate unless he has been <br/>
unjust and sinned. God is the protector of the good and God-fearing man <br/>
and Muhammad is the apostle of God. </p>
<p>1 Wellhausen, Skissen und Vornrbciten, v, Berlin, uSS’y, p. 70, renders ‘Lauterkcit steht <br/>
vor Tru^’ and accuses Sp render and Krehl of inexactness. S. has ‘sic miissen loyal und <br/>
nicht schlecht handeln’ where a general truth is in question. Suhayli says the meaning is <br/>
‘Piety and loyalty stand in the way of treachery’ (ii. 17). </p>
<p>2 For the meaning of this word cf. 519. 4 where bitumi clearly has such a connotation. </p>
<p>3 This is not clear to me. </p>
<p>4 For this idiom cf. Sura 6. 24. </p>
<p>5 Or ‘in Med ina’. Whether Medina is meant or not the passage stands self-condemned as <br/>
a later interpolation because the town is consistently called Yathrib. </p>
<p>2 34 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>BROTHERHOOD BETWEEN EMIGRANTS AND HELPERS </p>
<p>The apostle instituted brotherhood between his fellow emigrants and the <br/>
helpers, and he said according to what I have heard—and I appeal to <br/>
God lest I should attribute to him words that he did not say—‘Let each <br/>
of you take a brother in God.’ He himself Took 'All by the hand and said, <br/>
This is my brother.’ So God’s apostle, the lord of the sent ones and leader <br/>
of the God-fearing, apostle of the Lord of the worlds, the peerless and <br/>
unequalled, and 'All b. Abu Talib became brothers. Hamza, the lion <br/>
of God and the lion of his apostle and his uncle, became the brother of <br/>
Zayd b. Haritha the apostle’s freedman. To him Hamza gave his last <br/>
testament on the day of Uhud when battle was imminent in case he should <br/>
meet his death. Ja'far b. Abu Talib—the ‘one of the wings’ who was to <br/>
fly in Paradise—and Mu'adh b. Jabal brother of B. Salama became <br/>
brothers (285). </p>
<p>The pairs were arranged thus; </p>
<p>Abu Bakr and Kharija b. Zuhayr brother of B. ’ 1 -Harith b. al-Khazraj. <br/>
'Umar and Ttban b. Malik brother of B. Salim . . . b. al-Khazraj. </p>
<p>345 Abu 'Ubayda, 'Amir b. 'Abdullah and Sa'd b. Mu'adh b. al-Nu'man. <br/>
Abdu’l-Rahman b. Auf and Sa'd b. al-Rabl' brother of B. al-Harith. </p>
<p>Al-Zubayr b. al'Awwam and Salama b. Salama b. Waqsh brother of B. <br/>
'Abdu’l-Ashhal though others say that he linked up with 'Abdullah b. <br/>
Mas'ud the ally of the B. Zuhra. </p>
<p>Uthman b. 'Affan and Aus b. Thabit b. al-Mundhir brother of B. <br/>
al-Najjar. Talha b. 'Ubaydullah and Ka'b b. Malik brother of the B. <br/>
Salama. </p>
<p>Sa'd b. Zayd b. ‘Amr b. Nufayl and Ubayy b. Ka'b brother of the B. <br/>
al-Najjar. </p>
<p>Mus'ab b. 'Umayr and Abu Ayvub Khalid b. Zayd brother of the B. al- <br/>
Najjar Abu Hud hay fa b. 'Utba and 'Abbad b. Bishr b. Waqsh, brother of <br/>
the B. 'Abdu’l-Ashhal. </p>
<p>'Ammar b. Yasir ally of the B. Makhzum and Hudhayfa b. al-Yaman <br/>
brother of B. 'Abdu 'Abs ally of the B. 'Abdu’l-Ashhal. (Others say that <br/>
Thabit b. Qays b. al-Shammas brother of the B. al-Harith b. al-Khazraj <br/>
the prophet’s orator and 'Ammar b. Yasir.) </p>
<p>Abu Dharr, Burayr b. Junada al-Ghifari and al-Mundhir b. 'Amr, <br/>
'he who hastened to his death’, brother of B. Sa'ida of al-Khazraj <br/>
(286). </p>
<p>Hatib b. Abu Balta'a, ally of B. Asad b. 'Abdu’l-'Uzza and 'Uwaym <br/>
b. Sa'ida brother of B. 'Amr b. 'Auf. </p>
<p>Salman the Persian and Abu’l-Darda 'Uwaymir b. Tha'Iaba brother of <br/>
B. al-Harith (287). Some say 'Uwaymir was the son of 'Amir or of Zayd. <br/>
Bilal freedman of Abu Bakr and the apostle’s muezzin and Abu Ruwayha 1 </p>
<p>1 A kunya characteristic of a negro, ‘the father of the faint smell’. Cf. II. Lamtnens, </p>
<p>L' Arabic occidcntale avant I'llcgire, p. 246. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 235 </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. 'Abdu’l-Rahman al-Khath'ami, more precisely one of the <br/>
Faza'. </p>
<p>These are the men who were named to us as those to whom the <br/>
apostle made his companions brothers. </p>
<p>When 'Umar compiled the registers in Syria Bilal had gone there and <br/>
remained as a combatant. He asked him with whom he wished to be 346 <br/>
grouped and he said with Abu Ruwayha. ‘I will never leave him, for the <br/>
apostle established brotherhood between us.’ So he was linked with him <br/>
and the register of the Abyssinians was linked with Khath'am because of <br/>
Bilal’s position with them, and this arrangement continues to this day in <br/>
Syria. </p>
<p>ABU UMAMA </p>
<p>During the months in which the mosque was being built Abu Umama <br/>
As'ad b. Zurara died; he was seized by diphtheria and a rattling in the <br/>
throat. </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr b. Muhammad b. 'Amr b. I.Iazm told me on the <br/>
authority of Yahya b. 'Abdullah b. 'Abdu’l-Rahman b. As'ad b. Zurara <br/>
that the apostle said; ‘IIow unfortunate is the death of Abu Umama! </p>
<p>The Jews and the Arab hypocrites are sure to say “If he were a prophet <br/>
his companion would not die’’ and (truly) I have no power from God for <br/>
myself or for my companion (to avert death).’ </p>
<p>'Asim b. 'Umar b. Qatada al-Ansari told me that when Abu Umama died <br/>
the B. al-Najjar came to the apostle, for Abu Umama was their leader, saying <br/>
that he held the high rank the apostle knew of and would he appoint some¬ <br/>
one from among them to act in his place; to which the apostle replied, ‘You <br/>
are my maternal uncles, and we belong together so I will be your leader.’ </p>
<p>The apostle did not want to prefer any one of them to the others. Hence¬ <br/>
forth the B. al-Najjar regarded themselves as highly honoured in having <br/>
the apostle as their leader. </p>
<p>THE CALL TO PRAYER </p>
<p>When the apostle was firmly settled in Medina and his brethren the <br/>
emigrants were gathered to him and the affairs of the helpers were arranged <br/>
Islam became firmly established. Prayer was instituted, the alms tax and <br/>
fasting were prescribed, legal punishments fixed, the forbidden and the <br/>
permitted prescribed, and Islam took up its abode with them. It was this 347 <br/>
clan of the helpers who ‘have taken up their abode (in the city of the prophet) <br/>
and in the faith’. 1 When the apostle first came, the people gathered to <br/>
him for prayer at the appointed times without being summoned. At first <br/>
the apostle thought of using a trumpet like that of the Jews who used it to <br/>
summon to prayer. Afterwards he disliked the idea and ordered a clapper </p>
<p>’ Sura 59. y. </p>
<p>236 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>to be made, so it was duly fashioned to be beaten when the Muslims should <br/>
pray. </p>
<p>Meanwhile 'Abdullah b. Zayd b. Tha'laba b. 'Abdu Rabbihi brother of <br/>
B. al-Harith heard a voice in a dream, and came to the apostle saying: <br/>
‘A phantom visited me in the night. There passed by me a man wearing <br/>
two green garments carrying a clapper in his hand, and I asked him to sell <br/>
it to me. When he asked me what I wanted it for I told him that it was <br/>
to summon people to prayer, whereupon he offered to show me a better <br/>
way: it was to say thrice “Allah Akbar. I bear witness that there is no <br/>
God but Allah I bear witness that Muhammad is the apostle of God. <br/>
Come to prayer. Come to prayer. Come to divine service. 1 Come to <br/>
divine service. Allah Akbar. Allah Akbar. There is no God but Allah”.’ <br/>
When the apostle was told of this he said that it was a true vision if God <br/>
so willed it, and that he should go with Bilal and communicate it to him <br/>
so that he might call to prayer thus, for he had a more penetrating voice. <br/>
When Bilal acted as muezzin 'Umar heard him in his house and came <br/>
to the apostle dragging his cloak on the ground and saying that he had seen <br/>
precisely the same vision. The apostle said, ‘God be praised for that!’ </p>
<p>I was told of this tradition by Muhammad b. Ibrahim b. al-Harith on <br/>
the authority of Muhammad b. 'Abdullah b. Zayd b. Tha'laba himself <br/>
(288). </p>
<p>348 Muhammad b. Ja'far b. al-Zubayr told me on the authority of 'Urwa <br/>
b. al-Zubayr from a woman of B. al-Najjar who said: My house was the <br/>
highest of those round the mosque and Bilal used to give the call from <br/>
the top of it at dawn every day. He used to come before daybreak and <br/>
would sit on the housetop waiting for the dawn. When he saw it he would <br/>
stretch his arms and say, ‘O God, I praise thee and ask thy help for Quraysh <br/>
that they may accept thy religion.’ I never knew him to omit these words <br/>
for a single night. </p>
<p>ABU QAYS B. ABO ANAS </p>
<p>When the apostle was established in his house and God had manifested <br/>
his religion therein and made him glad with the company of the emigrants <br/>
and helpers Abu Qays spoke the following verses (289). </p>
<p>He was a man who had lived as a monk in heathen days and worn a <br/>
black mantle of camel-hair, given up idols, washed himself after impurity, <br/>
kept himself clean from women in their courses. He had thought of <br/>
adopting Christianity but gave it up and went into a house of his and made </p>
<p>1 Faldh. This word is generally rendered ‘salvation’ or ‘prosperity’; of. Lane, 2439(7. <br/>
But it has always seemed to me that it must be an arabized form of the Aramaic pulhdnil, <br/>
divine worship. Its original meaning is clearly cutting, especially ploughing. Among Ara¬ <br/>
maic-speaking Jews and Christians it was connected with the service of God. Between the <br/>
words ‘Come to the faldh and Allah Akbar’ the Shi'a cry ‘Come to the best work (’atrial)' <br/>
which must surely be a memory of the original meaning of faldh. 1. Sayyidi’l-Nas 'Vyunu’l- <br/>
Athar, Cairo, 1356, i. 204, quotes this story in what appears to be a more primitive form. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 237 </p>
<p>a mosque of it, allowing no unclean person to enter. He said that he <br/>
worshipped the Lord of Abraham when he abandoned idols and loathed <br/>
them. When the apostle came to Medina he became a good Muslim. He was <br/>
an old man, who always spoke the truth and glorified God in paganism. </p>
<p>He composed some excellent poetry and it was he who said: </p>
<p>Said Abu Qays when near to depart 349 </p>
<p>Perform all you can of my behest. </p>
<p>I enjoin piety, the fear of God, and </p>
<p>The preservation of your honour, hut piety comes first. </p>
<p>If your people hold authority envy them not. </p>
<p>If you yourselves rule, be just. </p>
<p>If a calamity befalls your people, </p>
<p>Put yourselves in the front of your tribe. </p>
<p>If a heavy duty falls on them help them <br/>
And bear the burdens they put upon you. </p>
<p>If you are poor, practise austerity. </p>
<p>If you have money be generous with it (290). </p>
<p>He also said: </p>
<p>Praise God at every dawn </p>
<p>When His sun rises and at the new moon. </p>
<p>. He knows what is clear and not dear to us. </p>
<p>What our Lord says is without error. </p>
<p>His are the birds which fly to and fro and shelter <br/>
In nests in their mountain retreats. </p>
<p>His are the wild creatures of the desert </p>
<p>Which you see on the dunes and in the shade of sandhills. </p>
<p>Him the Jews worship and follow <br/>
Every dreary custom you can think of. 1 <br/>
Him the Christians worship and keep <br/>
Every feast and festival to their Lord. </p>
<p>His is the self-denying monk you see, </p>
<p>A prisoner of misery though once right happy. </p>
<p>My sons, sever not the bonds of kinship. </p>
<p>Be generous though they are mean. 2 </p>
<p>Fear God in dealing with defenceless orphans </p>
<p>Often the forbidden is regarded as lawful. </p>
<p>Know that the orphan has an All-knowing protector <br/>
Who guides aright without being asked. </p>
<p>Devour not the wealth of orphans, </p>
<p>A mighty protector watches over the same. </p>
<p>1 A. Dh. explains that ‘ udal , a wearisome incurable disease, is a metaphor. </p>
<p>2 Commentators differ on the meaning of this phrase. Another possibility is: ‘Though <br/>
their pedigree is short their hearts arc generous'. All through these verses one feels that the <br/>
wretched rhymester is imprisoned within his rhymes. </p>
<p>238 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>My sons, transgress not the proper limits <br/>
'Transgressing the hounds brings one to a halt. </p>
<p>O my sons, trust not the days. </p>
<p>Beware their treachery and the passage of time. </p>
<p>Know that it consumes all creation, </p>
<p>Both the new and the old. </p>
<p>Live your lives in piety and godliness. </p>
<p>Abandon obscenity and hold fast to what is right. 1 </p>
<p>In the following poem he mentioned how God had honoured them with <br/>
Islam and His special favour in sending His apostle to them: </p>
<p>He abode among Quraysh some ten years <br/>
Hoping for a friend to help him. </p>
<p>He displayed himself to those who came to the fairs <br/>
But found none to offer him hospitality. </p>
<p>But when he came to us God displayed his religion <br/>
And he became happy and contented in Medina/ </p>
<p>He found friends and ceased to long for home <br/>
And w r as plainly helped by God. 3 <br/>
He told us what Noah said to his people <br/>
And what Moses answered when he was called. </p>
<p>None near at hand need he fear </p>
<p>And those afar he recked not of. 4 </p>
<p>We spent on him the best of our possessions, </p>
<p>Sparing not our lives in war at his side. </p>
<p>We know that there is nought beside God <br/>
And we know that God is the best guide. </p>
<p>We shall fight any man that fights Him, </p>
<p>Be he our dearest friend. </p>
<p>In every mosque when I pray to Thee <br/>
I say Blessed art Thou (Oft have I mentioned Thy name). </p>
<p>I say when I traverse a land I fear </p>
<p>‘Mercy! Let not my enemies triumph over me.’ </p>
<p>Go where you will death comes in many guises <br/>
And you cannot live for ever. </p>
<p>A man does not know how' to protect himself <br/>
Unless he makes God his protector. </p>
<p>The palm that needs water 5 cares naught for its owner <br/>
If it has moisture, though he be dead (291). </p>
<p>1 The influence of Syriac as in the words shammasa and tukhum is clear, and some of the <br/>
verses are reminiscent of the Psalms. </p>
<p>2 Tiba, ‘the Fragrant’, is the ancient honorific of Medina. Cf. Hassan’s opening line on <br/>
p. ro22, ‘In Tiba are the monuments of his luminous sojourn’. </p>
<p>3 W.’s text ‘He was a plain help to us from God’ seems inferior to the C. text. </p>
<p>4 The verse is just as banal in the original. </p>

<p>(T. 'Ali b. Mujahid said on the authority of Muhammad b. Ishaq from T. 1253. <br/>
al-Zuhr! and from Muhammad b. Salih from al-Sha'bl that they both said: </p>
<p>The B. Isma'il dated from the fire of Abraham to the building of the <br/>
temple when Abraham and Isma'il built it; then they dated from the <br/>
building of the temple until they dispersed, and it happened that when¬ <br/>
ever people left Tihama they dated from their leaving it, and those who <br/>
remained in Tihama of B. Isma'il used to date from the going out of <br/>
Sa'd and Nahd and Juhayna of B. Zayd from Tihama until Ka'b b. Lu’ayy <br/>
died. Then they dated from the death of Ka'b to the elephant. 'The dating <br/>
from the time of the elephant continued until 'Umar b. al-Khattab dated <br/>
from the Hijra which was the year 17 or 18. 1 </p>
<p>THE NAMES OF THE JEWISH ADVERSARIES </p>
<p>About this time the Jewish rabbis showed hostility to the apostle in envy, 351 <br/>
hatred, and malice, because God had chosen His apostle from the Arabs. </p>
<p>They were joined by men from al-Aus and al-Khazraj who had obstinately <br/>
clung to their heathen religion. They were hypocrites, clinging to the <br/>
polytheism of their fathers denying the resurrection; yet when Islam <br/>
appeared and their people flocked to it they were compelled to pretend <br/>
to accept it to save their lives. But in secret they were hypocrites whose <br/>
inclination was towards the Jews because they considered the apostle a liar <br/>
and strove against Islam. </p>
<p>It was the Jewish rabbis who used to annoy the apostle with questions <br/>
and introduce confusion, so as to confound the truth with falsity. The <br/>
Quran used to come down in reference to these questions of theirs, though <br/>
some of the questions about what was allowed and forbidden came from <br/>
the Muslims themselves. These are the names of those Jews: </p>
<p>From B. al-Nadir: Huyayy b. Akhtab and his brothers Abu Yasir and <br/>
Judayy; Sallam b. Mishkam; Kinana b. al-Rabi' h. Abu’l-Huqayq; </p>
<p>Sallam b. Abu’l-Huqayq Abu Rafi' al-A'war whom the apostle’s com¬ <br/>
panions killed in Khaybar; al-Rabi' b. al-Rabi' b. Abu’l-IIuqayq; 'Amr <br/>
b. Jahhash; Ka'b b. al-Ashraf who belonged to Tay’, of the clan of B. </p>
<p>Nabhan, his mother being from B. al-Nadir; al-Hajjaj b. 'Amr, an ally of <br/>
Ka'b; and Kardam b. Qays, an ally of Ka'b. </p>
<p>From B. Tha'laba b. al-Fityaun: 'Abdullah h. Suriya the one-eyed who <br/>
was the most learned man of his time in the Hijaz in Torah studies; Ibn <br/>
Saluba; and Mukhayriq their rabbi who became a Muslim. </p>
<p>From B. Qaynuqa': Zayd b. al-Lasit (291); Sa'd b. Hunayf; Mahmud <br/>

<p>1 This paragraph is part of a long chapter which T, devotes to the question of chronology <br/>
in reference to the principal events in the prophet’s life. It is put here because the last <br/>
passage he quotes from 1 . 1 , is the poem of Abu Qays mentioning the length of the prophet’s <br/>
sojourn in Mecca after the beginning of his mission; the connexion with chronology is <br/>
obvious. </p>

<p>B. 'Amr b. 'Auf: Qardam b. 'Amr. </p>
<p>From B. al-Najjar: Silsila b. Barham. </p>
<p>These were the Jewish rabbis, the rancorous opponents of the apostle <br/>
and his companions, the men who asked questions, and stirred up trouble <br/>
against Islam to try to extinguish it, except for 'Abdullah b. Salam and <br/>
Mukhayrlq. 2 </p>
<p>353 'ABDULLAH B. SALAM ACCEPTS ISLAM </p>
<p>I was told the story of 'Abdullah b. Salam, a learned rabbi, by one of his <br/>
family. He said: ‘When I heard about the apostle I knew by his descrip¬ <br/>
tion, name, and the time at which he appeared that he was the one we <br/>
were waiting for, and I rejoiced greatly thereat, though I kept silent about <br/>
it until the apostle came to Medina. When he stayed in Quba’ among the <br/>
B. 'Amr b. 'Auf a man came with the news while I was working at the top <br/>
of a palm-tree and my aunt Khalida d. al-Harith was sitting below. When <br/>
I heard the news I cried Allah Akbar and my aunt said, “Good gracious, <br/>
if you had heard that Moses b. 'Imran had come you could not have made <br/>
more fuss!” “Indeed, aunt,” I said, “he is the brother of Moses and follows <br/>
his religion, being sent with the same mission.” She asked, “Is he really </p>
<p>1 In commenting on this Suhayli asserts that the tradition is sound and is accepted by the <br/>
traditionists. He found in the Jami' of Mu'ammar b. Rashid {a work which I cannot find <br/>
mentioned by Brockelmann) the statement that the spell lasted for a year. He adds that the <br/>
Mu'tazila and Modernists rejected the tradition on the ground that prophets could not be <br/>
bewitched otherwise they would commit sin and that would be contrary to the word of God <br/>
‘And God will protect thee from men’ (Sura 5. 71). He finds the tradition unassailable. It <br/>
is properly attested and intellectually acceptable. The prophets were not preserved from <br/>
bodily afflictions in which category sorcery falls, </p>
<p>2 It is noteworthy how few Hebrew names are to be found among the Jews of Medina. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 241 </p>
<p>the prophet who we have been told wall be sent at this very time ?” and <br/>
she accepted my assurance that he was. Straightway I went to the apostle <br/>
and became a Muslim, and w'hen I returned to my house I ordered my <br/>
family to do the same. </p>
<p>‘I concealed the matter from the Jew's, and then went to the apostle <br/>
and said, “The Jews are a nation of liars and I wish you w’ould take me into <br/>
one of your houses and hide me from them. Then ask them about me so <br/>
that they may tell you the position I hold among them before they know <br/>
that I have become a Muslim. For if they know it beforehand they will <br/>
utter slanderous lies against me.” The prophet housed me; the Jew's came; <br/>
and the apostle asked them about my standing among them. They said: </p>
<p>“He is our chief, and the son of our chief; our rabbi, and our learned man.” <br/>
When they said this I emerged and said: “O Jews, fear God and accept <br/>
what He has sent you. For by God you know' that he is the apostle of God. </p>
<p>You will find him described in your Torah and even named. I testify <br/>
that he is the apostle of God, I believe in him, I hold him to be true, and <br/>
I acknowledge him.” They accused me of lying and reviled me. Then I 354 <br/>
reminded the apostle that I had said that they would do this, for they <br/>
were a treacherous, lying, and evil people. I publicly proclaimed my <br/>
conversion and my household and my aunt Khalida followed suit.’ </p>
<p>THE STORY OF MUKHAYRlQ </p>
<p>He was a learned rabbi owming much property in date palms. He re¬ <br/>
cognized the apostle by his description and his own learning, and he <br/>
felt a predilection for his religion 1 until on the day of Uhud, which fell on <br/>
the sabbath, he reminded the Jews that they were bound to help Muham¬ <br/>
mad. They objected that it w r as the sabbath. ‘May you have no sabbath,’ 2 <br/>
he answered, and took his weapons and joined the apostle in Uhud. His <br/>
parting testimony to his people was: ‘If I am killed today my property is <br/>
to go to Muhammad to use as God show's him.’ He w r as killed in the battle <br/>
that followed. I am told that the apostle used to say ‘Mukhayrlq is the best <br/>
of the Jews.’ The apostle took over his property and all the alms he <br/>
distributed in Medina came from ifi </p>
<p>THE TESTIMONY OF S A FI Y A </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr b. Muhammad b. 'Amr b. Hazm told me that he <br/>
was told that Safiya d. Huyayy b. Akhtab said ‘I was the favourite child <br/>
of my father and my uncle Abu Yasir. When I w T as present they took no <br/>
notice of their other children. W'hen the apostle was staying in Quba’ <br/>
with the B. 'Amr b. 'Auf, the two w r ent to see him before daybreak and did <br/>
not return until after nightfall, weary, worn out, drooping and feeble. </p>
<p>1 Presumably ‘Muhammad's religion’; the pronoun is ambiguot: </p>
<p>2 Or, perhaps, 'You have no rabbath’. </p>
<p>II 4080 </p>
<p>242 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>355 I went up to them in childish pleasure as I always did, and they were so <br/>
sunk in gloom that they took no notice of me. I heard my uncle say to my <br/>
father, “Is he he? Do you recognize him, and can you be sure?” “Yes!” <br/>
“And what do you feel about him?” “By God I shall be his enemy as long <br/>
as I live!” ’ </p>
<p>THE JEWS ARE JOINED BY ANSARl HYPOCRITES </p>
<p>The following hypocrites’ from al-Aus and al-Khazraj joined the Jews <br/>
according to information given me. God knows best about the truth. <br/>
From Aus of the section of B. 'Amr b. 'Auf b. Malik of the subdivision <br/>
Laudhan b. 'Amr b. r Auf: Zuwayy b. al-Harith. From B. Hubayb b. ‘Amr <br/>
b. ‘Auf: Julas b. Suwayd b. al-Samit and his brother al-Harith. Julas was <br/>
one of those who withdrew from the apostle in the raid on Tabuk. He <br/>
said, ‘If this man is right we are worse than donkeys.’ 'Umayr b. Sa'd, one <br/>
of them, w r ho was closely related to Julas, he having married his mother <br/>
after his father’s death, reported what he had said to the apostle. But <br/>
first he said to Julas: ‘You are dearer to me than any man, the most <br/>
generous to me, and it is most painful to me that anything should happen <br/>
to upset you; but you have said words which if I repeat them I shall bring <br/>
shame upon you, and if I keep silence I shall bring my religion into peril. <br/>
One is preferable to the other.’ Then he went to the apostle and told him <br/>
what Julas had said. Julas sw r ore by God that he had not said the words <br/>
attributed to him by 'Umayr. And God sent down concerning him: <br/>
‘They swear by God that they did not say, when they did actually say, <br/>
words of unbelief and did disbelieve after they had surrendered themselves. <br/>
They planned what they could not carry out and they had nothing to <br/>
avenge but that God and His apostle had enriched them by His bounty. <br/>
If they repent it will be better for them; and if they turn back God will <br/>
afflict them with a painful punishment in this world and the next. In this <br/>
world they have no friend or helper’ (295). 2 </p>
<p>356 It is alleged that he repented and was known to be a good Muslim. <br/>
His brother*al-Harith who killed al-Mujadhdhar b. Dhiyad al-BalawI and <br/>
Qays b. Zayd one of B. Dubay'a at Uhud, went out with the Muslims. He <br/>
was a hypocrite, and when battle was joined he fell upon these two men, <br/>
killed them, and attached himself to Quraysh (296). </p>
<p>Mu'adh b. ‘Afra’ killed Suw r ayd treacherously when there w r as no war. <br/>
He shot him with an arrow before the battle of Bu'ath. </p>
<p>The apostle—so they say—had ordered 'Umar to kill him if he could <br/>
get hold of him, but he escaped and got to Mecca. Then he sent to his <br/>
brother Julas asking for forgiveness so that he might return to his people. </p>
<p>1 Wha*b Arabic writers mean by ‘hypocrites’ has been made dear in the section on the <br/>
Jewish adversaries. It is not a really good rendering of mundfiq , but no one word suggests <br/>
itself as better. Muslims look with a tolerant eye on a man who conceals his belief through <br/>
force majeure, but to pretend to be a Muslim is a crime. 2 Sura 9. 75. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 243 </p>
<p>God sent down concerning him according to what I have heard on the <br/>
authority of Ibn Abbas: ‘How can God guide a people-who have dis¬ <br/>
believed alter having believed and witnessed that the apostle is true and </p>
<p>sure proofs have come to them from God. God does not guide a sinful <br/>
people.’’ </p>
<p>From B. Pubay'a b. Zayd b. Malik b. 'Auf b. 'Amr b. 'Auf: Bijad b. <br/>
Uthman b. 'Amir. From B. Laudhan b. 'Amr b. 'Auf: Nabtal b. al- Harith <br/>
I have heard that it was of him that the apostle said, ‘Whoever wants to see <br/>
Satan let him take a look at Nabtal b. al-Harith!’ He was a sturdy black <br/>
man with long flowing hair, inflamed eyes, and dark ruddy cheeks. He <br/>
used to come and talk to the apostle and listen to him and then carry what <br/>
he had said to the hypocrites. It was he who said: ‘Muhammad is all <br/>
ears: if anyone tells him anything he believes it.’ God sent down concern¬ <br/>
ing him: And of them are those who annoy the prophet and say he is all 357 <br/>
ears.. Say: Good ears for you. He believes in God and trusts the believers <br/>
and is a mercy for those of you who believe; and those who annoy the <br/>
apostle of God for them there is a painful punishment.’ 2 </p>
<p>A man of B. al- Ajlan told me that he was told that Gabriel came to the <br/>
apostle and said, ‘There comes to sit with you a black man with long <br/>
flowing hair, ruddy cheeks, and inflamed eyes like two copper pots. His <br/>
heart 3 is more gross than a donkey’s; he carries your words to the hypo¬ <br/>
crites so beware of him.’ This, so they say, was the description of <br/>
Nabtal. r </p>
<p>Also from B. Dubay'a was Abu Habiba b. al-Az'ar, one of those who <br/>
had built the mosque of al-Dirar; Tha'laba b. Hatib; and Mu'attib b. <br/>
Qushayr. It was those two who made a covenant with God saying, ‘If <br/>
he gives us of his bounty we will give alms and be of the righteous’ 4 <br/>
to the end of the story. And it was Mu'attib who said at Uhud: ‘If we had <br/>
any part in the ordering of things we should not be killed here.’ So God <br/>
sent down concerning what he said: ‘A party who were anxious about their <br/>
lives thought wrongly about God as the pagans thought. They said: </p>
<p>If we had any part in the ordering of things we should not be killed here” 3 <br/>
to the end of the context. It was he who said on the day of the Parties <br/>
Muhammad promises us that we shall enjoy the treasures of Chosroes <br/>
and Caesar whereas it is not safe for one of us to go to the privy'” So God <br/>
revealed concerning him: ‘And when the hypocrites and those in whose </p>
<p>ddusion ?fi diSeaSe S3y G ° d and his a P ostle have promised us nothing but a </p>
<p>Also al-Harith b. Hatib (297). </p>
<p>Also -Abbad b. Hunayf brother of Sahl, and Bahzaj who were anion, the </p>
<p>bmklers of the mosque of al-Dirar. And 'Amr b. Kliidham and 'Abdullah <br/>
b. Nabtal. </p>
<p>Of the IS. Tha'laba were Jariya b. 'Amir b. al-'Attaf and h,s two sons .,,8 </p>

<p>Zayd and Mujammi'. They were also concerned with the mosque of al- <br/>
Dirar. Mujammi' was a youth who had collected most of the Quran and <br/>
he used to lead them in prayer. When the mosque had been destroyed and <br/>
certain men of B. 'Arm b. 'Auf who used to lead their people in prayer in <br/>
their mosque, died, in the time of 'Umar, Mujammi' was mentioned to act <br/>
as leader, but 'Umar would not have it, saying, ‘Wasn’t he the imam of the <br/>
hypocrites in the mosque of al-Dirar?’ He replied: ‘By God, I knew nothing <br/>
of their affairs. But I was a youngster who could recite the Quran, <br/>
whereas they could not, so they put me forward to lead the prayers. Their <br/>
affair seemed to me to accord with the best account they gave. They allege <br/>
that 'Umar let him go and lead the prayers of his people. </p>
<p>Of B. Umayya b. Zayd b. Malik: Wadi'a b. Thabit, one of the builders <br/>
of the Dirar mosque who said, ‘We were only talking and jesting. So <br/>
God sent down: ‘If you ask them they will say tve were only talking and <br/>
jesting. Say: Is it about God and His signs and His apostle you were </p>
<p>jesting?’to the end of the passage. </p>
<p>Of B. Ubayd b. Zayd b. Malik: IChidham b. Khalid, from whose house <br/>
the mosque of al-Dirar was carved out; and Bishr and Raff the two </p>
<p>sons of Zayd. , TT . , , . 7r , </p>
<p>Of B. al-Nablt (298) of the clan of B. Haritha b. al-Harith b. al-Khazraj </p>
<p>b. 'Amr b. Malik b. al-Aus: Mirba' b. Qayzl who said to the apostle when <br/>
he passed through his garden on his way to Uliud: ‘I do not allow you <br/>
Muhammad to pass through my garden even if you are a prophet. He <br/>
took a handful of dirt and said: ‘By God, if I did not know that I might <br/>
throw it on others I would throw this dirt at you.’ The people pressed on <br/>
him to kill him and the apostle said: ‘Let him alone. For this blind man <br/>
is blind of heart and blind of perception’. Sad b. Zayd brother of B. <br/>
'Abdu’l-Ashhal hit him with his bow and wounded him; also his brother <br/>
359 Aus b. Qayzl, who said to the apostle on the day of the Trench: ^ Our <br/>
houses lie open to the enemy, so give us leave to go back to them. So <br/>
God revealed concerning him: ‘They say Our houses lie open to the enemy. <br/>
They are not open; all they want is to run away’ (299). 1 </p>
<p>Of B. Zafar (Zafar’s name was Ka'b b.al-Harith b. al-Khazraj): Hatib b. <br/>
Umayya b. Raff'. He was a sturdy old man steeped long in paganism. <br/>
A son of his was one of the best of the Muslims, Yazid by name. He was <br/>
disabled by wounds received at Uhud and was carried to the house o the </p>
<p>‘Asim b. 'Umar b. Qatada told me that the Muslims there both men and <br/>
women gathered to him when he was at the point of death and were saying. <br/>
‘Rejoice? O son of Hatib, in the thought of paradise!’ Then his hypocrisy <br/>
showed itself, for his father said, ‘Humph! By God it is a garden of rue. <br/>
You have sent this poor fellow to his death by your deception. </p>
<p>Also Bus'hayr b. Ubayriq Abu TVma, the ‘Stealer of the Two Breast¬ <br/>
plates’ concerning whom God sent down: ‘And argue not on behalf of </p>
<p>1 Sura g. 66. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 245 </p>
<p>those w r ho deceive themselves. God does not love a sinful deceiver.’ 1 <br/>
Also Quzman, an ally of theirs. </p>
<p>The same 'Asim told me that the apostle used to say: ‘He belongs to the <br/>
people of hell.’ At Uhud he fought so valiantly that he killed several <br/>
polytheists. But they severely wounded him and he w r as carried to the <br/>
quarters of the B. Zafar. The Muslims said, ‘Cheer up, O Quzman; you <br/>
have done gallantly today and your sufferings have been for God’s sake.’ </p>
<p>He said: ‘Why should I cheer up? I fought only to protect my people.’ </p>
<p>And w r hen the pain of his wounds became unendurable he took an arrow <br/>
from his quiver and cut a vein in his hand and thus committed suicide. </p>
<p>Among B. 'Abdu’l-Ashhal no hypocrite male or female was known 360 <br/>
except al-Dahhak b. Thabit, one of the B. Ka'b of the family of Sa'd b. <br/>
Zayd. He was suspected of hypocrisy and love of the Jews. </p>
<p>Hassan b. Thabit said of him: 2 </p>
<p>Who will tell al-Dahhak that his veins <br/>
Were unable to be glorified in Islam? </p>
<p>Do you love the Jews of al-Hijaz and their religion, </p>
<p>You liver-hearted ass, and not love Muhammad? </p>
<p>Their religion will never march with ours <br/>
As long as men roam the open desert. </p>
<p>I have heard that before his repentance Julas together with Mu'attib, <br/>
Rafi', and Bishr used to make false profession of Islam. 3 Some Muslims <br/>
asked them to go to the apostle to settle a matter in dispute between them, <br/>
while they wanted to refer it to the kahins w r ho acted as arbitrators in the <br/>
pagan era. So God sent down concerning them: ‘Hast thou considered <br/>
those who allege that they believe in what has been sent down to thee <br/>
and what was sent down before thee who wash to go to idolatry for arbitra¬ <br/>
tion w'hen they have been commanded to give up belief in it ? Satan wishes <br/>
to lead them far astray.’ 4 </p>
<p>Of Khazraj from B. al-Najjar: Rafi' b. Wadi'a, Zayd b. 'Amr, 'Amr <br/>
b. Qays, and Qays b. 'Amr b. Sahl. </p>
<p>Of B. Jusham of the clan of B. Salima: al-Jidd b. Qays w r ho said, ‘O <br/>
Muhammad, give me leave (to stay at home) and tempt me not.’ So God <br/>
sent down concerning him: ‘Of them is he who says, Give me leave (to stay <br/>
at home) and tempt me not. Surely it is into temptation that they have <br/>
fallen and hell encompasses the unbelievers.’ 5 </p>
<p>Of B. 'Auf b. al-Khazraj: 'Abdullah b. Ubayy b. Salul. He was the <br/>
head of the hypocrites. They used to gather to him and it was he who said, </p>
<p>‘If we go back to Medina the stronger will drive out the weaker.’ This <br/>
■was during the raid on the B. al-Mustaliq and the whole sura of the </p>
<p>1 Sura 4. 107. I.H. has omitted much of what Yunus reported from 1 . 1 . See Suhayli, <br/>

<p>Hypocrites 1 came down about him and Wadi'a a man of B. 'Auf and Malik <br/>
b. Abu Qauqal and Suwayd and Da'is of the clan of 'Abdullah b. Ubayy. <br/>
Those were his men who sent secret messages to B. al-Nadir 2 when the <br/>
361 apostle besieged them: ‘Stand fast, for by God if you are driven out we will <br/>
go forth with you and we will never obey anyone against you and if you are <br/>
attacked we will help you.’ So God sent down concerning them: ‘Hast <br/>
thou not considered the hypocrites who say to their brethren of the scrip¬ <br/>
ture folk, If you are driven out we will go forth with you and we will <br/>
never obey anyone against you and if you are attacked w r e will help you. <br/>
God bears witness that they are liars’, as far as His words ‘Like Satan <br/>
when he says to men, “Disbelieve,” and when they disbelieve he says, <br/>
“I am not responsible for you; for my part I fear God the Lord of the <br/>
worlds.” ’ 3 </p>
<p>THE RABBIS WHO ACCEPTED ISLAM HYPOCRITICALLY </p>
<p>The following arc the Jewish rabbis who took refuge in Islam along with <br/>
the Muslims and hypocritically professed it: Of B. Qaynuqa': Sa'd b. <br/>
Hunayf; Zayd b. al-Lusayt; Nu man b. Aufa b. 'Amr; 'Uthman b. Aufa; <br/>
Zayd b. al-Lusayt who fought with 'Umar in the market of the B. Qay¬ <br/>
nuqa'. He was the man who said when the apostle’s camel wandered <br/>
off: ‘Muhammad alleges that revelations come to him from heaven and he <br/>
doesn’t know where his camel is!’ When the apostle heard of what this <br/>
enemy of God had said and God had told him where his camel was he said, <br/>
‘I only know what God lets me know. And God has shown me. It is in <br/>
such-and-such a glen caught by its rope to a tree.’ The Muslims went <br/>
and found it in that very spot caught up as the apostle had said. </p>
<p>Also Rafi' b. Huraymila of whom I have heard that the prophet said, <br/>
36a ‘One of the greatest hypocrites has died today.’ And Rifa'a b. Zayd b. <br/>
al-Tabut of whom the prophet said when there was a high wind as he was <br/>
returning from the expedition against the B. al-Mustaliq and the Muslims <br/>
were in great anxiety: ‘Don’t be afraid; the wind is blowing because a <br/>
great unbeliever is dead.’ When he got back to Medina he found that <br/>
Rifa'a had died the day the wind blew. Also Silsila b. Barham and Kinana <br/>
b. Suriya. </p>
<p>These hypocrites used to assemble in the mosque and listen to the <br/>
stories of the Muslims and laugh and scoff at their religion. When some <br/>
of them 4 were there one day the apostle saw them talking with lowered <br/>
voice among themselves huddled together. He ordered that they should <br/>
be ejected and they were put out with some violence. Abu Ayyub Khalid <br/>
b. Zayd b. Kulayb got up and went to 'Amr b. Qays, one of B. Ghanm </p>
<p>1 Sura 63. Cf. W. 727 infra. </p>
<p>2 Cf. W. 653. 10. 3 Sura 59- n-:6. </p>
<p>4 It is by no means certain that these men were Jews. The previous section almost cer¬ <br/>
tainly proves that they were not; however they may well have been half converted to <br/>
Judaism like so many of the inhabitants of Medina. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 247 </p>
<p>b. Malik b. al-Najjar who was the custodian of their gods during the pagan <br/>
era, took hold of his foot and dragged him outside the mosque, he saying <br/>
meanwhile ‘Would you drag me out of the datebarn of the B. Tha'laba!’ <br/>
Then he W'ent for Rah' b. Wadi'a, one of the B. al-Najjar, gripped him <br/>
by his robe, slapped his face, and dragged him forcibly out of the mosque, <br/>
saying, ‘Faugh! you dirty hypocrite! Keep out of the apostle’s mosque, <br/>
you hypocrite!’ (300). </p>
<p>'Umara b. Hazm went lor Zayd b. 'Amr who had a long beard and seized <br/>
him by it and dragged him violently out of the mosque. Then clenching <br/>
his fists he punched him in the chest and knocked him down, Zayd crying <br/>
the meanwhile, ‘You have torn my skin off!’ ‘God get rid of you, you <br/>
hypocrite,’ he answered, ‘God has a worse punishment than that in store <br/>
for you, so don’t come near the apostle’s mosque again!’ (301). </p>
<p>Abu Muhammad Mas'ud b. Aus b. Zayd b. Asram b. Zayd b. Tha'laba 363 <br/>
b. Ghanm b. Malik b. al-Najjar (who was at Badr) w r ent for Qays b. <br/>
'Amr b. $ahl who was a youth (the only &gt;^)ung man known to have been <br/>
among the hypocrites) and pushed him in the back of the neck until he <br/>
ejected him from the mosque. </p>
<p>A man of B. al-Khudra b. al-Khazraj of the family of Abu Sa'd called <br/>
'Abdullah b. al-Harith, hearing the order to clear the mosque, went for <br/>
al-Harith b. 'Amr, a man with long hair, and taking a good grip of it he <br/>
dragged him violently the whole way along the floor until he put him <br/>
out, the hypocrite meanwhile saying ‘You are very rough, Ibnu’l-Harith.’ <br/>
‘Serve you right, you enemy of God, for what God has sent down about <br/>
you,’ he answered, ‘Don’t come near the apostle’s mosque again, for you <br/>
are unclean.’ </p>
<p>A man of B. 'Amr b. 'Auf went for his brother Zuwayy b. al-Harith <br/>
and put him out violently, saying, ‘Faugh! You are doing Satan’s work <br/>
for him!’ </p>
<p>These were the hypocrites whom the apostle ordered to be expelled <br/>
from the mosque that day. </p>
<p>REFERENCES TO THE HYPOCRITES AND THE JEWS IN THE <br/>
SURA ENTITLED ‘THE COW’ </p>
<p>The first hundred verses of the sura of the Cow came down in reference <br/>
to these Jewish rabbis and the hypocrites of Aus and Khazraj, according to <br/>
what I have been told, and God knows best. He said: 'Alif Lam Mim. </p>
<p>That is the book wherein there is no doubt.’ The word rayb means doubt <br/>
( 3 02 )&gt; </p>
<p>‘A guidance to the god-fearing’, i.e. those who fear God’s punishment 364 <br/>
for abandoning the guidance they ■ recognize, and hope for His mercy <br/>
through believing in what has come to them from Him. ‘Who believe <br/>
in the unseen and establish prayer and give out what We have provided <br/>
them with,’ i.e. they establish prayer in its prescribed form and pay the </p>
<p>248 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>poor-tax expecting a (future) reward for it. ‘And those who believe in <br/>
what has been sent down to thee and to those who were before thee/ i.e. <br/>
they believe thee to be true in what thou hast brought from God and what <br/>
the sent ones brought before thee, making no difference between them nor <br/>
opposing what they brought from their Lord. ‘And are certain of the <br/>
latter end/ i.e. the waking from death, the resurrection, paradise and hell, <br/>
the reckoning and the scales, i.e. these are those who allege that they believe <br/>
in what was before thee and in what has come to thee from thy Lord. <br/>
‘These live in guidance from their Lord/ i.e. according to light from their <br/>
Lord and uprightly according to what has come to them. ‘These are they <br/>
who prosper/ i.e. who attain what they seek and escape the evil they flee <br/>
from. ‘As for those who disbelieve,’ i.e. in what has been sent down to <br/>
thee though they say we have long believed in what came to us before thee, <br/>
‘it is all one to them whether thou warn them or do not warn them they <br/>
will not believe/ i.e. they disbelieve that thou art mentioned (in the books) <br/>
they have and they reject the covenant which was made with them with <br/>
reference to thee. They disbelieve in what has come to thee and in what <br/>
they have already which others brought to them so how will they listen to <br/>
warning and exhortation from thee when they have denied that they have <br/>
any knowledge of thee? ‘God hath sealed their hearts and their hearing <br/>
and over their sight there is a covering/ i.e. so that they will never find <br/>
guidance, meaning: because they have declared you a liar so that they will <br/>
not believe in the truth which has come to thee from thy Lord though they <br/>
believe in all that came before thee. For opposing thee they will have an <br/>
awful punishment. Thus far concerning the Jewish rabbis for calling the <br/>
truth a lie after they knew' it. </p>
<p>‘And there are some men who say, We believe in God and the last day <br/>
w'hen they do not believe.’ He means the hypocrites of Aus and Khazraj <br/>
and their followers. ‘They would deceive God and those who believe, <br/>
but they deceive only themselves, and perceive it not. In their hearts <br/>
is a sickness,’ i.e. doubt. ‘And God increases their sickness/ i.e. doubt. </p>
<p>365 ‘A painful punishment is theirs because they lie. And when it is said to <br/>
them, ‘Do not make mischief in the land they say we are only putting <br/>
things to right,’ i.e. we only wish to make peace between the two parties <br/>
of the believers and the scripture folk. God said: ‘Are not they indeed the <br/>
mischief makers but they perceive it not? And when it.is said to them, <br/>
Believe as the people believe they say: Are we to believe as the foolish <br/>
believe ? Surely they are the foolish but they know it not. And when they <br/>
meet those who believe they say, We believe; and w'hen they go apart to <br/>
their leaders,’ 1 i.e. the Jews who order them to deny the truth and contra¬ <br/>
dict what the apostle brought, ‘They say Certainly we are with you/ i.e. <br/>
we agree entirely with you. ‘We were only mocking/ i.e. mocking the <br/>
people and jesting with them. God said: ‘God will mock at them and let <br/>
them continue to wander blindly in their error’ (303). </p>
<p>! Lit. 'their satans’. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 249 </p>
<p>‘These are they who buy error at the price of guidance/ i.e. disbelief <br/>
for faith. ‘So their traffic is not profitable and they are not rightly guided.’ </p>
<p>Then God employed a simile and said: ‘They are like a man who lights <br/>
a fire and when it lightens his environment God takes away their light and <br/>
leaves them in darkness unable to see,’ i.e. they cannot see the truth and <br/>
profess it so that when they go out with it from the darkness of unbelief <br/>
they extinguish it with their unbelief and hypocrisy, and God leaves <br/>
them in the darkness of unbelief and they do not see guidance and are not <br/>
upright in truth. ‘Deaf, dumb, blind, and they return not,’ i.e. they <br/>
return not to guidance, deaf, dumb, blind to what is good, they return not <br/>
to good and find no escape from their condition. ‘Or like a rainstorm from <br/>
heaven wherein is darkness and thunder and lightning. They put their <br/>
fingers in their ears because of the thunderings, in fear of death. God <br/>
encompasses the unbelievers’ (304), i.e. because of the darkness of 366 <br/>
unbelief and the fear of death in which they are, arising from their opposi¬ <br/>
tion and fear of you, they are like the man in the rainstorm who puts his <br/>
fingers in his ears at the thunderclaps in fear of death. He says: And <br/>
God brings that vengeance upon them, i.e. He encompasses the urn- <br/>
believers. ‘The lightning almost takes away their sight/ i.e. because of the <br/>
exceeding brightness of the truth. ‘Whenever it gives light to them they <br/>
walk in it and when it is dark for them they stand still,’ i.e. they know the <br/>
truth and talk about it and so far as their talk goes they are on the straight <br/>
path; but when they relapse from it into infidelity they come to a halt in <br/>
bewilderment. ‘And if God willed He could take away their hearing and <br/>
their sight,’ i.e. because they have forsaken the truth after they knew it. <br/>
‘God is able to do all things.’ </p>
<p>Then He says: ‘O men, worship your Lord,’ addressing both unbelievers <br/>
and hypocrites, i.e. acknowledge His unity. ‘Who created you and those <br/>
before you, perchance you may ward off evil. Who has made the earth a <br/>
bed for you and the heaven a building, and sent down water from heaven <br/>
and has brought forth fruits thereby as food for you. So make not rivals of <br/>
God w'hen you know (better)’ (305), i.e. do not associate with God rivals <br/>
which can neither profit nor harm when you know that you have no Lord <br/>
that can feed you other than He, and you know that the monotheism to <br/>
which the apostle calls you is the truth about which there is no doubt. </p>
<p>‘And if you are in doubt about that which We have sent down to our 367 <br/>
servant/ i.e. in doubt about what he has brought you, ‘then produce a <br/>
sura like it and summon your witnesses other than God,’ i.e. whatever <br/>
helpers you can get ‘if you are truthful; and if you do not and you cannot’ <br/>
for the truth has become clear to you, ‘then fear hell whose fuel is men and <br/>
stones 1 prepared for the unbelievers,’ i.e. for those who are in a state of <br/>
infidelity like you. </p>
<p>Then he appeals to their interest and warns them against breaking the <br/>
covenant which He made with them in reference to His prophet when </p>
<p>1 It is said that the stones were those worshipped by the pagan Arabs. </p>
<p>250 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>He came to them, and He reminds them of the beginning of their creation <br/>
when He created them, and what happened to their forefather Adam ami <br/>
how he was dealt with for his disobedience; then He says: 1 '0 children of <br/>
Israel,’ addressing the Jewish rabbis, ‘Remember the favour I showed you,’ <br/>
i.e. My care for you and your fathers, wherewith He delivered them from <br/>
Pharaoh and his army. ‘And fulfil My covenant’ which I placed on your <br/>
necks with regard to My prophet Ahmad when he should come to you. <br/>
‘I shall fulfil My part of the covenant.’ I shall carry out what I promised <br/>
you for believing in and following him by removing the bonds and chains <br/>
which were upon your necks because of the sins which you had com¬ <br/>
mitted. ‘And stand in awe of Me,’ i.e. lest I bring down on you what I <br/>
brought down on your fathers before you—the vengeance that you know of, <br/>
bestial transformation and the like. ‘And believe in what I have sent down <br/>
confirming what you already have, and be not the first to disbelieve it <br/>
seeing that you have knowledge which others have not about it. And <br/>
fear Me and do not mingle truth with falsehood nor hide the truth which <br/>
you know,’ i.e. do not conceal the knowledge which you have about My <br/>
apostle and what he has brought when you will find it with you in what <br/>
you know of the books which are in your hands. ‘Would you tell men to be <br/>
good and forget to be so yourselves, you being readers of scripture? Do <br/>
you not understand?’ i.e. would you forbid men to disbelieve in the <br/>
prophecy you have and the covenant of the TY&gt;rah and abandon it yourselv es ? <br/>
i.e. when you deny that it contains My covenant with you that you must <br/>
pronounce My apostle to be true, and you break My agreement and you <br/>
contradict what you know to be in My book. </p>
<p>Then He recounts their sins, mentioning the calf and what they did <br/>
with it; how He forgave them and pardoned them; then their words <br/>
‘Show us God plainly’ (306); and how the storm came upon them because <br/>
of their presumptuousness; then He quickened them after they had died, <br/>
overshadowed them with the cloud, sent down to them manna and quails <br/>
and said to them, ‘Enter the gate with prostrations and say Hitta,’ 2 i.e. say <br/>
what I command you, and I will remove your sins from you; and their <br/>
changing that word making a mockery of His command; and His forgiving <br/>
them after their mockery (307). </p>
<p>With regard to their changing that word, the apostle said according <br/>
to what Salih b. Kaisan from Salih, freedman of al-Tau ama d. Umayya <br/>
b- Khalaf from Abu Hurayra and someone above suspicion from Ibn <br/>
‘Abbas: They entered the gate they were ordered to enter with prostra¬ <br/>
tions in a crowd saying, ‘Wheat is in the barley (308)* (He a l so reminded <br/>
them of) Moses praying for water for his people and His commanding <br/>
him to strike the rock with his staff so that the water gushed forth in <br/>
twelve streams, one for each tribe to drink from, each tribe knowing the </p>
<p>1 The meaning of this word (lit. unloading, or relief), and indeed the significance of the </p>
<p>whole passage, is obscure. Presumably a Jewish midrash lies behind it. Cf. Geiger, op. cit. 17 • </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 251 </p>
<p>one from which it was to drink. And their saying to Moses, ‘We cannot <br/>
bear one kind of food. Fray to your Lord for us that He may bring forth to <br/>
us vegetables which the earth produces such as cucumbers and corn (309) <br/>
and beans and onions. He said: Will you exchange that which is better <br/>
for that which is baser? Go down to Egypt; thus you will get what you <br/>
ask for.’ They did not do so. Further how He raised the mountain above <br/>
them 1 that they might receive what was brought to them; and the bestial <br/>
transformation when He made them into apes for their sins; and the cow <br/>
which God showed them in which there was a lesson concerning the slain <br/>
man about whom they differed until God made clear to them his affair <br/>
after their repeated requests to Moses for a description of the cow; <br/>
further the hardness of their hearts afterwards so that they were harder <br/>
than stone. Then He said: ‘There are rocks from which rivers gush forth <br/>
and there are rocks which split asunder and water comes out of them, and <br/>
there are rocks which fall down for fear of God,’ i.e. some rocks are softer <br/>
than your hearts in regard to the truth to which you were called. ‘And <br/>
God is not unaware of what you do.’ </p>
<p>Then He said to Muhammad and the.believers with him, causing them <br/>
to despair of them: ‘Do you hope that they will believe you when there is a <br/>
party of them who listen to the word of God then change it after they <br/>
understand it, doing so knowingly?’ His saying ‘They listen to the Torah’ 2 <br/>
does not mean that they all heard it, but only a party of them, i.e. a selected <br/>
number according to what I was told by a scholar. They said to Moses: <br/>
Something has come between us and the vision of God so let us hear <br/>
His word when He speaks to thee. Moses conveyed the request to God <br/>
who said: Yes, command them to purify themselves or to purify their <br/>
clothing and to fast; and they did so. Then he brought them forth to the 370 <br/>
mountain, and when the cloud covered them Moses commanded them to <br/>
prostrate themselves and his Lord spoke to him and they heard His voice <br/>
giving them commands and prohibitions so that they understood what they <br/>
heard. Then he went back with them to the Children of Israel and when <br/>
he came to them a party of them changed the commandments they had <br/>
been given; and when Moses said to the Children of Israel, ‘God has <br/>
ordered you to do so-and-so,’ they contradicted him and said that God <br/>
had ordered something else. It is they to whom God refers. </p>
<p>Then God said: ‘And when they meet those who believe they say: </p>
<p>We believe,’ i.e. in your leader the apostle of God; but he (has been sent) <br/>
to you alone. And when they go apart with one another they say, Don’t <br/>
talk to the Arabs about this for you used to ask for victory over them <br/>
through him and he is of them. So God sent down concerning them: </p>
<p>‘And when they meet those who believe they say, We believe. But when </p>

<p>252 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>they go apart with one another they say, Will you talk about what God has <br/>
revealed to you that they may contend with you about it before your Lord ? <br/>
Have you no understanding?’ i.e. maintain that he is a prophet since you <br/>
know that God has made a covenant with you that you should follow him, <br/>
while he tells you that he is the prophet whom we are expecting and find <br/>
in our book. Oppose him and do not recognize him. God said: ‘Do they <br/>
not know that God knows what they conceal and what they proclaim, <br/>
and some of them are gentiles 1 who do not know the book but merely <br/>
recite passages (310). 2 ‘They only think they know, i.e. they don t <br/>
know the book and they do not know what is in it, yet they oppose thy <br/>
prophethood on mere opinion. ‘And they say the fire will not touch us <br/>
except for a limited time. Say, Have ye received a covenant horn God ? <br/>
God will not break His covenant—or do you say what you do not know <br/>
about God ?’ </p>
<p>A freedman of Zayd b. Thabit told me as from 'Ikrima or from Sa'id <br/>
b. Jubayr from Ibn 'Abbas: The apostle came to Medina when the Jews <br/>
were saying that the world would last for seven thousand years and that <br/>
God would only punish men in hell one day in the next world for every <br/>
thousand in this world. There would be only seven days and then punish¬ <br/>
ment would cease. So God sent dowm concerning this saying: And they <br/>
say, The fire will not touch us except for a limited time. Say, Have ye <br/>
received a covenant from God? God will not break His covenant or do <br/>
you say what you do not know about God ? Nay whoso does evil and his sin <br/>
encompasses him,’ i.e. he who does as you do and disbelieves as you <br/>
disbelieve, his unbelief encompasses the good he has acquired with God. <br/>
‘They are the people of hell; they will be there eternally,’ i.e. for ever. <br/>
‘And those who do good, they are the people of paradise; they will be there <br/>
eternally,* i.e. those who believe in what you deny and do what you have <br/>
left undone of His religion. They shall have paradise for ever. He <br/>
tells them that the recompense for good and evil is eternal: it will never <br/>
cease. </p>
<p>Then He said in blaming them, ‘And when We made a covenant with the <br/>
children of Israel,’ i.e. your covenant. ‘Worship none but God, show <br/>
kindness to parents and to near relatives, and to orphans and the poor, <br/>
and speak kindly to men, and establish prayer and pay the poor-tax, <br/>
then you turned your backs except a few of you, being averse,’ 3 i.e. you <br/>
abandoned all that—nothing less. ‘And when we made a covenant with </p>
<p>1 This word uvvni is generally translated ‘illiterate’. In Sura 7. 157 an d t5® Muhammad <br/>
calls himself ‘the gentile prophet’; but practically all Arab writers claim that he meant that <br/>
he could not read or write (see, e,g., Pickthall’s translation). Geiger, op. cit. 26 f., was, I <br/>
think, the first to point out the only possible derivation of the word, and he has been followed <br/>
by every subsequent European Arabist. But this passage brings to light the fact that he was <br/>
preceded by these two early traditionists who identified the ummtyun as Arab proselytes who <br/>
did not themselves know the scriptures. </p>
<p>1 That is to say these Arabs cannot read the sacred books, but they can join in the Jewish <br/>
liturgy reciting the prayers and responses. </p>
<p>3 v. 77. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 253 </p>
<p>you, Shed not your blood* (311). 1 ‘And do not turn (some of) your people 1 <br/>
out of your dwellings. Then ye ratified it and you are witnesses thereof,’ 373 <br/>
i.e. that My covenant condition truly binds you. ‘Then you are they who <br/>
kill your people and drive some of them from their houses, supporting <br/>
one another against them by crime and transgression,’ i.e the polytheists, <br/>
so that they shed their blood along with them and drive them from their <br/>
houses along with them. ‘And if they came to you as prisoners you would <br/>
ransom them’ knowing that that is incumbent upon you in your religion, <br/>
‘while their expulsion is forbidden to you’ in your scripture. ‘Will you <br/>
believe in a part of the scripture and disbelieve in another part ?’ i.e. <br/>
will you ransom them believing in one part and expel them disbelieving in <br/>
another part? ‘And what is the recompense of those of you who do that <br/>
but shame in this world and on the day of resurrection they will be sent to <br/>
the severest punishment. For God is not unaware of w r hat you are doing. <br/>
These are they who buy this life at the price of the next life. Their punish¬ <br/>
ment will not be lightened nor will they be helped.’ Thus God blamed <br/>
them for what they were doing, He having in the Torah prohibited <br/>
them from shedding each other’s blood and charged them to redeem <br/>
their prisoners. </p>
<p>There were two parties: The B. Qaynuqa' and their adherents, allies of <br/>
Khazraj; and al-Nadir and Qurayza and their adherents allies of Aus. <br/>
When there was war between Av-^and Khazraj the B. Qaynuqa' went out <br/>
with Khazraj, and al-Nadir and Qurayza with Aus, each side helping his <br/>
allies against his own brethren so that they shed each other’s blood, while <br/>
the Torah w r as in their hands by which they knew what was allowed and <br/>
what was forbidden them. Aus and Khazraj were polytheists worshipping 373 <br/>
idols knowing nothing about paradise and hell, the waking and the resur¬ <br/>
rection, the scriptures, the permitted and the forbidden. When the war <br/>
came to an end they ransomed their prisoners in accordance with the Torah <br/>
each side redeeming those of their men who had been captured by the <br/>
other side, disregarding the bloodshed that had been incurred in helping <br/>
the polytheists. God said in blaming them for that: ‘Will you believe in a <br/>
part of the scripture and disbelieve in another part?’ i.e. would you <br/>
redeem him in accordance with the Torah and kill him when the Torah <br/>
forbids you to do so, killing him and driving him out of his house and <br/>
helping the polytheist who worships idols instead of God against him, all <br/>
for the sake of this world’s gain? According to my information this passage <br/>
came down with reference to their behaviour with Aus and Khazraj. </p>
<p>He continued: ‘We gave Moses the scripture and We sent apostles after <br/>
him and We gave Jesus, Son of Mary, the clear proofs,’ i.e. the signs which <br/>
were wrought by Him in raising the dead; forming the likeness of birds <br/>
from clay and then breathing into them so that they became birds by <br/>
God’s permission * healing the sick; and news of many hidden things which </p>
<p>1 Your blood and yourselves, because in ancient Semitic thought the tribe was one blood <br/>
and had as it were one personality. </p>
<p>254 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>they stored in their houses; and His confuting them from the Torah and <br/>
the Gospel which God had created for Him . 1 Then he mentions their <br/>
disbelief in all that and says: ‘Is it that whenever there comes to you an <br/>
apostle with w r hat you do not like you act arrogantly; some you declare <br/>
liars and some you put to death?’ Then he says: ‘And they said, Our <br/>
hearts are uncircumcised,’ i.e. in coverings. ‘Nay, but God has cursed <br/>
them for their unbelief. Little do they believe. And when a scripture <br/>
comes to them from God confirming what they already have, though <br/>
before that they were asking for a victory over the unbelievers, when there <br/>
comes to them what they know they deny it. God’s curse is on the un¬ <br/>
believers.’ </p>
<p>'Asim b. 'Umar b. Qatada told me that shaykhs of his people said: <br/>
This passage came down about us and them. We had got the better of <br/>
them in the pagan era, we being polytheists and they scripture folk. They <br/>
374 used to say to us, ‘Soon a prophet will be sent whom we shall follow; his <br/>
time is at hand. With his help we shall kill you like 'Ad and Iram.’ And <br/>
when God sent His apostle from Quraysh and we followed him they <br/>
denied him. God said: ‘And w r hen there comes to them what they know <br/>
they deny it. God’s curse is on the unbelievers. Wretched is that for <br/>
w r hich they sell themselves in disbelieving in what God has sent down, <br/>
grudging that God should send down of His bounty upon whom He will of <br/>
His servants,’ i.e. that He should have given it to one who was not of them. <br/>
‘They have incurred anger upon anger and for the unbelievers there is a <br/>
shameful punishment’ (312). </p>
<p>The double anger is His anger at what they have disregarded of the <br/>
Torah which they had and His anger at their disbelieving in this prophet <br/>
whom God had sent to them . 2 Then He told them of 3 the raising of the <br/>
mountain above them and their taking the calf as a god instead of their <br/>
Lord. God then said: ‘Say, If the last dwelling with God is for you alone <br/>
excluding others, then long for death if you are truthful,’ i.e. pray for <br/>
death to which of the two parties is most false with God. And they <br/>
refused the apostle’s suggestion. God said to His prophet: ‘They will <br/>
never long for it because of what their hands have sent before them ,’ 4 <br/>
i.e. because they know about thee by the knowledge which they have <br/>
and deny it, It is said that if they had longed for it the day he said that to <br/>
them, not a single Jew would have remained on the earth but would have <br/>
died. Then He mentions their love of this life and of a long life and God <br/>
said: ‘Thou wilt find them the most eager of men for life’, the Jew's, ‘even <br/>
more than the polytheists; each one W'ould like to live a thousand years <br/>
and to be allowed to live long would not remove him from the punishment,’ <br/>
i.e. it w r ould not deliver him from it. The reason is that the polytheist </p>

to him’. 2 Ahdatha ilayhirn. </p>
<p>3 The text of VV. and C. annabahum ‘blamed them’ yields no suitable meaning. The true <br/>

<p>4 i.e. their past deeds. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 255 </p>
<p>does not hope for raising after death so he w'ants to live long, and the Jew <br/>
know's what awaits him of shame in the next life because he has wasted the <br/>
knowledge that he has. I hen God said: ‘Say, Who is an enemy to Gabriel ? </p>
<p>For it is lie who brought it down to thy heart by God’s permission.’ </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. 'Abdu’l-Rahman b. Abu Husayn al-Makkl told me from 375 <br/>
Shahr b. Haushab al-Ash ari that a number of Jewish rabbis came to the <br/>
apostle and asked him to answer lour questions, saying that if he did so <br/>
they would follow him and testify to his truth, and believe in him. He <br/>
got them to swear a solemn oath that if he gave them the right answers <br/>
they would acknowledge his truth and they began: ‘Why does a boy <br/>
resemble his mother when the semen comes from the man?’ ‘I adjure <br/>
you by God and^ His favours towards the children of Israel, 1 do you not <br/>
know that a man’s semen is white and thick while a woman’s is yellow and <br/>
thin, and the likeness goes with that which comes to the top?’ ‘Agreed,’ <br/>
they said. Tell us about your sleep.’ ‘Do you not know that a sleep which <br/>
you allege I do not have is when the eye sleeps but the heart is awake?’ <br/>
Agreed.’ ‘Thus is my sleep. My eye sleeps but my heart is awake.’ ‘Tell <br/>
us about what Israel voluntarily forbade himself.’ ‘Do you not know that <br/>
the food he loved best was the flesh and milk of camels and that once when <br/>
he was ill God restored him to health so he deprived himself of his favourite <br/>
food and drink in gratitude to God?’ ‘Agreed. Tell us about the Spirit.’ </p>
<p>Do you not know that it is Gabriel, he who comes to me?’ ‘Agreed, but <br/>
0 Muhammad he is an enemy to us, an angel who comes only ’with <br/>
violence and the shedding of blood, and were it not for that we would <br/>
follow you.’ So God sent down concerning them: ‘Who is an enemy to <br/>
Gabriel? For it is he who brought it down to thy heart by God’s permis¬ <br/>
sion confirming what was before it and a guidance and good tidings to the <br/>
believers as far as the words ‘ Is it not that when they make a covenant some <br/>
of them set it aside, nay most of them do not believe. And when an apostle 376 <br/>
comes to them from God confirming that which they have, some of them <br/>
who have received the scripture, the book of God, put it behind them as if <br/>
they did not know it and they follow that which the satans read concerning <br/>
the kingdom of Solomon,’ i.e. sorcery. ‘Solomon did not disbelieve, but <br/>
the satans disbelieved, teaching men sorcery.’ 2 </p>
<p>This, so I have heard, happened when the apostle mentioned Solomon <br/>
b. David among the sent ones. One of the rabbis said, ‘Don’t you wonder <br/>
at Muhammad? He alleges that Solomon was a prophet, and by God he <br/>
was nothing but a sorcerer.’ So God sent down concerning that: ‘Solomon <br/>
did not disbelieve but the satans disbelieved,’ i.e. in following sorcery <br/>
and practising it. ‘And that which was revealed to the two angels Harut and <br/>
Marut in Babylon and they taught nobody.’ </p>
<p>Someone above suspicion told me from ; Ikrima from Ibn 'Abbas that he <br/>
used to say: ‘What Israel forbade himself was the two lobes of the liver, </p>
<p>1 This formula is repeated four times. </p>
<p>2 v. 94. </p>
<p>256 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>the kidneys and the fat (except what was upon the back), for that used to be <br/>
offered in sacrifice and the fire consumed it .’ 1 </p>
<p>The apostle wrote to the Jews of Khaybar according to what a freedman <br/>
of the family of Zayd b. Thabit told me from Ikrima or from Sa id b. <br/>
Jubayr from Ibn 'Abbas: Tn the name of God the compassionate the <br/>
merciful from Muhammad the apostle of God friend and brother of <br/>
Moses who confirms what Moses brought. God says to you, O scripture <br/>
folk, and you will find it in your scripture ii Muhammad is the apostle o <br/>
God; and those with him are severe against the unbelievers, merciful <br/>
among themselves. Thou seest them bowing, falling prostrate seeking <br/>
bounty and acceptance from God. The markof their prostrations is on their <br/>
foreheads. That is their likeness in the Torah and in the Gospel like a <br/>
seed which sends forth its shoot aftd strengthens it and it becomes thick <br/>
and rises straight upon its stalk delighting the sowers that He may anger the <br/>
unbelievers with them. God has promised those who believe and do well <br/>
forgiveness and a great reward .” 2 I adjure you by God, and by what <br/>
He has sent down to you, by the manna and quails He gave as food to your <br/>
tribes before you, and by His drying up the sea for your fathers when <br/>
He delivered them from Pharaoh and his works, that you tell me, Do </p>
<p>377 you find in what He has sent down to you that you should believe in <br/>
Muhammad? If you do not find that in your scripture then there is no <br/>
compulsion upon you. “The right path has become plainly distinguished <br/>
from error ” 3 so I call you to God and His prophet (313)- </p>
<p>Among those people concerning whom the Quran came down, especially <br/>
the rabbis and unbelieving Jews who used to ask him questions and annoy <br/>
him in confusing truth with falsehood'—as I was told on the authority of <br/>
‘Abdullah b. ‘Abbas and Jabir b. 'Abdullah b. Ri ab was Abu Yasir b. <br/>
Akhtab who passed by the apostle as he was reciting the opening words of <br/>
The Cow: ‘Alif, Lam, MIm, That is the book about which there is no <br/>
doubt.<em> He came to his brother Huyayy who was with some other, Jews <br/>
and said: ‘Do you know that I have heard Muhammad reciting in what has <br/>
been sent down to him Alif Lam Mim, &amp;c?</em> After expressing surprise <br/>
Huyayy and these men went to the apostle and told him what had been <br/>
reported to them and asked if Gabriel had brought the message from God. <br/>
When he said that he had they said: God sent prophets before you but we <br/>
do not know of anyone of them being told how long his kingdom would <br/>
last and how long his community would last. Huyayy went up to his men <br/>
and said to them: ‘Alif is 1; Lam is 30; and Mim is 40, i.e. 71 years. Are <br/>
you going to adopt a religion whose kingdom and community will last </p>
<p>378 for only 71 years?’ Then he went to the apostle and said, ‘Have you any¬ <br/>
thing else, Muhammad?* ‘Yes, Alif Lam Mim Sad.’ ‘This by God is <br/>
more weighty and longer: Alif 1; Lam 30; Mim 40, Sad 96, i.e. 161 years. </p>
<p>1 This is the sacrificial law given in Leviticus 3,4, io, 15, &amp;c., and the tradition shows a <br/>
remarkable knowledge of the Jewish Law. </p>
<p>2 Sura 48. 29. </p>
<p>3 Sura 2. 257. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 257 </p>
<p>Similar questions were asked and answered in respect of Alif Lain' Ra 231; <br/>
Alii Lam Mim Ra 271; then he said, ‘Your situation seems obscure to us, <br/>
Muhammad, so that we do not know whether you will have a short or <br/>
long duration.’ 1 hen they left him. Abu Yasir said to his brother Huyayy <br/>
and the others, ‘How do you know that all these totals should not be added <br/>
together to make a grand total of 734 years?’ They answered, ‘His affair <br/>
is obscure to us.* They allege that these verses came down in reference to <br/>
them: ‘The plain verses are the mother of the Book; the rest are obscure.’ 1 </p>
<p>I heard a scholar above suspicion mentioning that these verses were sent <br/>
down about the people of Najran when they came to the apostle to ask <br/>
him about Jesus, Son of Mary. </p>
<p>Muhammad b. Abu Umama b. Sahl b. Hunayf told me that he had heard <br/>
that they were sent down about a number of Jews, but he did not explain <br/>
that to me. God knows best. </p>
<p>According to what I heard from ‘Ikrima, freedman of Ibn ‘Abbas or <br/>
from Sa Id b. Jubayr from Ibn ‘Abbas, Jews used to hope that the <br/>
apostle would be a help to them against Aus and Khazraj before his mission <br/>
began; and when God sent him from among the Arabs they disbelieved <br/>
in him and contradicted what they had formerly said about him. 2 Mu'adh <br/>
b. Jabal and Bishr b. al-Bara b. Ma rur brother of the B. Salama said to <br/>
them: O Jews, fear God and become Muslims, for you used to hope for <br/>
Muhammad’s help against us when we were polytheists and to tell us that 379 <br/>
he would be sent and describe him to us.’ Salam b. Mishkam, one of B. <br/>
al-Nadlr, said, ‘He has not brought us anything we recognize and he is <br/>
not the one we spoke of to you.’ So God sent down about that saying of <br/>
theirs: ‘And when a book comes to them from God confirming what they <br/>
have, though beforehand they were asking for help against those who <br/>
disbelieve, when there came to them what they knew, they disbelieved in <br/>
it, so God’s curse rests on the unbelievers.’ 3 </p>
<p>Malik b. al-Sayf 4 said when the apostle had been sent and they were <br/>
reminded of the condition that had been imposed on them and what God <br/>
had covenanted with them concerning him, ‘bio covenant was ever made <br/>
with us about Muhammad.’ So God sent down concerning him: ‘Is it not <br/>
that whenever they make a covenant a party of them set it aside? blay most <br/>
of them do not believe’.’ 5 </p>
<p>Abu Saluba al-Fityunl said to the apostle: ‘O Muhammad, you have <br/>
not brought us anything we recognize, and God has not sent down to you <br/>
any sign that we should follow' you.’ So God sent down concerning his <br/>
words, ‘We have sent down to thee plain signs and only evildoers dis¬ <br/>
believe in them.’ </p>
<p>Rafi‘ b. Huraymila and Wahb b. Zayd said to the apostle, ‘Bring us a </p>
<p>1 Sura 3. 5, </p>
<p>2 This and similar passages seem to indicate that the messianic: hope was strong among </p>
<p>the Jews. 3 Sura 2. 83. </p>
<p>Or al-Dayf. v.s. s S ura 2&lt; 94 </p>
<p>B 40S0 </p>
<p>258 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>book; bring it down to us from heaven that we may read it; bring out <br/>
rivers for us from the earth, then we will follow you and believe in you.’ <br/>
So God sent down concerning that: ‘Or do you wish to question your <br/>
apostle as Moses w'as questioned aforetime; he who exchanges faith for <br/>
unbelief has wandered from the straight road’ (314)- 1 </p>
<p>Huyayy and Abu Yasir were the most implacable enemies of the Arabs <br/>
when God chose to send them an apostle from among themselves and they <br/>
3 g 0 used to do all they could to turn men away from Islam. So God sent down <br/>
concerning them: ‘Many of the scripture folk wish to make you unbelievers <br/>
again after you have believed being envious on their own account after the <br/>
truth has become plain to them. But forgive and be indulgent until God <br/>
shall give you His orders. God can do anything.’ 2 </p>
<p>When the Christians of Najran came to the apostle the Jewish rabbis <br/>
came also and they disputed one with the other before the apostle. RafV <br/>
said, ‘You have no standing,’ and he denied Jesus and the Gospel; and a <br/>
Christian said to the Jew’s, ‘You have no standing’ and he denied that <br/>
Moses was a prophet and denied the Torah. So God sent down concerning <br/>
them: ‘The Jews say the Christians have no standing; and the Christians <br/>
say that Jews have no standing, yet they read the scriptures. They do not <br/>
know what they are talking about. God will judge between them on the <br/>
day of resurrection concerning their controversy,’ i.e. each one reads in his <br/>
book the confirmation of w’hat he denies, so that the Jew's deny’ Jesus <br/>
though they have the Torah in which God required them by the word of <br/>
Moses to hold Jesus true; while in the Gospel is what Jesus brought in <br/>
confirmation of Moses and the Torah he brought from God: so each one <br/>
denies what is in the hand of the other. </p>
<p>Raft' said: ‘If you are an apostle from God as you say, then ask God to <br/>
speak to us so that we may hear His voice.’ So God revealed concerning <br/>
that: ‘And those who do not know say, Why does not God speak to us or a <br/>
sign come to us ? Those w’ho were before them said the same. Their minds <br/>
are just the same. We have made the signs clear to a people who are sure.’ </p>
<p>‘Abdullah b. Suriya, the one-eyed man, said to the apostle, ‘The only <br/>
guidance is to be found wdth us, so follow us, Muhammad, and you will <br/>
381 be rightly guided.’ The Christians said the same. So God sent down <br/>
concerning them both: ‘And they say, Be Jew’s or Christians then you <br/>
will be rightly guided. Say, Nay, the religion of Abraham a hamf who was <br/>
no polytheist,’ as far as the words ‘Those are a people who have passed <br/>
away; they have what they earned and you have what you have earned and <br/>
you will not be asked about w’hat they used to do.’ 3 </p>

<p>2 6o The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>When God smote Quraysh at Badr, the apostle assembled the Jews in the <br/>
market of the B. Qaynuqa' when he came to Medina and called on them to <br/>
accept Islam before God should treat them as he had treated Quraysh. <br/>
They answered, ‘Don’t deceive yourself, Muhammad. You have killed a <br/>
number of inexperienced Quraysh who did not know how to fight. But <br/>
if you fight us you will learn that we are men and that you have met your <br/>
equal.’ So God sent down concerning their words: ‘Say to those who <br/>
disbelieve, You will be defeated and gathered into hell, a wretched resting- <br/>
place. You had a sign in the two parties which met: one party fought in the <br/>
way of God and the other was unbelieving seeing twice their number with <br/>
their very eyes. God will strengthen with His help whom He will. In that </p>
<p>there is a warning for the observant.’ 1 </p>
<p>The apostle entered a Jewish school where there was a number of Jews <br/>
and called them to God. Al-Nu' man b. 'Amr and al-Harith b. Zayd said <br/>
to him: </p>
<p>‘What is your religion, Muhammad? </p>
<p>‘The religion of Abraham.’ </p>
<p>‘But Abraham was a Jew.’ </p>
<p>‘Then let the Torah judge between us.’ </p>
<p>They refused, and so God sent down concerning them: ‘Hast thou not <br/>
seen how those who have received a portion of scripture when invited to <br/>
God’s book that it may judge between them, a party of them turn their <br/>
backs in opposition. That is because they say, The fire will not touch us <br/>
except for a limited time. What they were inventing has deceived them in </p>
<p>their religion.’ , . </p>
<p>The Jewish rabbis and the Christians of Najran, when they were together <br/>
before the apostle, broke into disputing. The rabbis said that Abraham <br/>
was nothing but a Jew. 1 he Christians said he was nothing but a Christian, <br/>
so God revealed concerning them: ‘O Scripture folk, Why do you argue <br/>
about Abraham when the Torah and the Gospel were not sent down untd <br/>
after his time? Can it be that you do not understand ? Behold, you are <br/>
they who argue of what you know something, but why do you argue <br/>
about what you know nothing ? God knows but you do not know. Abiaham <br/>
was neither'a Jew nor a Christian but he was a Muslim hamf and he was <br/>
not a polytheist. Those who are the nearest to Abraham are those who <br/>
follow him and this prophet and those who believe, God being the friend of </p>
<p>believers.’ 2 , TT . , , ,. , , </p>
<p>‘Abdullah b. Sayf and ‘Adiy b. Zayd and .al-Harith b. Auf agreed </p>
<p>among themselves that they should affect to believe in what had been sent <br/>
down to Muhammad and his companions at one time and deny it at another <br/>
so as to confuse them, with the object of getting them to follow their <br/>
example and give up his religion. So God sent down concerning them. <br/>
‘O Scripture folk, why confuse ye the true with the false and conceal the <br/>
truth which you know? Some of the Scripture folk said, Believe in that <br/>
i e r ,, Q , TO 2 Sura 3. 58. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 261 </p>
<p>which has been sent down to those that believe at the beginning of the <br/>
day and deny it at the end of the day; perhaps they will go back (on it). <br/>
Believe only in one who follows your religion. Say, The guidance is <br/>
God’s guidance that anyone should be given the like of what you have <br/>
been given or that they may argue with you before their Lord. Say: the <br/>
bounty is in the hand of God. He giveth it to whom he pleases and God is <br/>
all-embracing and all-knowing.’ 1 </p>
<p>Abu Rafi' al-Qurazi said when the rabbis and the Christians from <br/>
Najran had assembled before the apostle and he invited them to Islam, </p>
<p>‘Do you want us, Muhammad, to worship you as the Christians worship <br/>
Jesus, Son of Mary?’ One of the Christians called al-Ribbis (or al-Ris or <br/>
al-Ra’Ts) said, ‘Is that what you want of us and invite us to, Muhammad?’ <br/>
or words to that effect. The apostle replied, ‘God forbid that I should <br/>
worship anyone but God or order that any but He should be worshipped. </p>
<p>God did not send me and order me to do that’ or words to that effect. So <br/>
God sent down concerning their words: ‘No mortal to whom God has <br/>
sent a book and authority and prophecy could say to men,Worship me <br/>
instead of God; but Be learned in that you teach the book and in that you <br/>
study it’ as far as the words ‘after ye had become Muslims’ (316). 2 </p>
<p>‘And he did not command you to take the angels and prophets as 385 <br/>
lords. Would He command you to disbelieve after you had become <br/>
Muslims ?’ </p>
<p>Then he mentions how God had imposed on them and on their prophets <br/>
the obligation to bear witness to his truth when he came to them and their <br/>
taking that upon themselves and he says: ‘When God made His covenant <br/>
with the prophets (He said) Behold that which I have given you—a book <br/>
and wisdom. Then when an apostle shall come to you confirming what <br/>
you have, you shall believe in him and help him. He said, Do you agree <br/>
and take upon yourselves my burden ? They answered, We agree. He said, <br/>
Then bear witness, I being with you as a witness’ to the end of the passage. </p>
<p>Shiis b. Qays, who was an old man hardened in unbelief and most <br/>
bitter against the Muslims and exceeding envious of them, passed by a <br/>
number of the apostle’s companions from Aus and Khazraj in a meeting <br/>
while they were talking together. When he saw their amity and unity and <br/>
their happy relations in Islam after their enmity in pagan times he was <br/>
filled with rage and said: ‘The chiefs of B. Qayla in this country having <br/>
united there will be no firm place for us with them.’ So he gave orders to a <br/>
Jewish youth who was with them to go to them and sit with them and <br/>
mention the battle of Bu'ath and the preceding events, and recite to them <br/>
some of the poetry composed by each side. </p>
<p>Now at the battle of Bu'ath Aus and Khazraj fought and the victory <br/>
went to Aus who were commanded at the time by Hudayr b. Simak 386 <br/>
al-Ashhall the father of Usayd b. Hudayr, Khazraj being led by 'Amr b. al- <br/>
Nu'man al-Bayadi, and both were killed (317). </p>
<p>1 Sura 3. . </p>
<p>2 Sura 3. 73. </p>
<p>262 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>The youth did so. Thereupon the people began to talk and to quarrel <br/>
and to boast until two men of the two clans leapt up, Aus b. Qayzi of B. <br/>
Haritha b, Harith of Aus and Jabbar b. Sakhr of B. Salama of Khazraj. <br/>
They began to hold forth against each other until one of them said, ‘If <br/>
you wish we will do the same again.’ Thereupon both sides became enraged <br/>
and said, ‘We will. Your meeting-place is outside—that being the volcanic <br/>
tract—To arms! To arms!’ So out they went and when the news reached <br/>
the apostle he went out with such of the emigrants as were with him and <br/>
said to them: ‘0 Muslims, remember God. Remember God. Will you <br/>
act as pagans while I am with you after God has guided you to Islam and <br/>
honoured you thereby and made a clean break with paganism; delivered <br/>
you thereby from unbelief; made you friends thereby?’ Then the people <br/>
realized that the dissension was due to Satan and the guile of their enemy. <br/>
They wept and the men of Aus and Khazraj embraced one another. Then <br/>
they went off with the apostle, attentive and obedient, God having <br/>
quenched the guile of the enemy of God Shas b. Qays. So God sent down <br/>
concerning him, and w’hat he did: ‘Say: O Scripture folk, why do you deny <br/>
God’s signs while God is witness of w’hat you do ? Say, O Scripture folk, </p>
<p>387 w'hy do you keep those w'ho believe from God’s way wishing to make it <br/>
crooked w r hen you are witnesses and God is not unmindful of what you <br/>
are doing?’ 1 </p>
<p>God sent down concerning Aus and Jabbar and the people who were <br/>
with them when Shas brought back for a moment the atmosphere of <br/>
pagan days, ‘O you w r ho believe, if you obey some of those to whom a <br/>
•book has been given they will make you unbelievers again after your <br/>
faith. How- can you disbelieve w'hen God’s verses are read to you and His <br/>
apostle is with you? He who holds fast to God is guided to a straight path. <br/>
O ye who believe, fear God as He ought to be feared and die not except as <br/>
Muslims’ as far as the words ‘Those shall have a painful punishment’. </p>
<p>When Abdullah b. Salam, Tha'laba b. Sa'ya, and Usayd b. Sa'ya, and <br/>
Asad b. 'Ubayd and other Jews became Muslims and believed and were <br/>
earnest and firm in Islam, the rabbis who disbelieved said that it was only <br/>
the bad Jews who believed in Muhammad and followed him. Had they <br/>
been good men they would not have forsaken the religion of their fathers <br/>
and adopted another. So God sent dowm concerning what they had said: <br/>
‘They are not (all) alike: of the scripture folk there is an upright community <br/>
who read God’s verses in the night season prostrating themselves (318). 2 <br/>
They believe in God and the last day and enjoin good conduct and forbid <br/>
evil and vie with one another in good works. Those are the righteous.’ </p>
<p>Some Muslims remained friends w r ith the Jew's because of the tie of <br/>
mutual protection and alliance which had subsisted between them, so <br/>
God sent down concerning them and forbidding them to take them as </p>
<p>388 intimate friends: ‘O you W'ho believe, do not choose those outside your <br/>
community as intimate friends. They will spare no pains to corrupt you </p>

<p>longing for your ruin. From their mouths hatred has already shown itself <br/>
and what their breasts conceal is greater. We have made the signs plain <br/>
to you if you will understand. Behold you love them but they love not <br/>
you and you believe in the book—all of it,” i.e. you believe in their book <br/>
and in the books that were before that w'hile they deny your book, so that <br/>
you have more right to hate them than they to hate you. ‘And when they <br/>
meet you they say, We believe and when they go apart they bite their <br/>
fingers against you in rage. Say, Die in your rage’, &amp;c. </p>
<p>Abu Bakr went into a Jew'ish school and found a good many men gathered <br/>
round a certain Finhas, one of their learned rabbis, and another rabbi <br/>
called Ashyab Abu Bakr called on the former to fear God and become a <br/>
Muslim because he knew that Muhammad w-as the apostle of God w'ho <br/>
had brought the truth from Him and that they wmuld find it written in the <br/>
Torah and the Gospel. Finhas replied: ‘We are not poor compared to <br/>
Allah but He is poor compared to us. We do not humble ourselves to <br/>
Him as He humbles Himself to us; we are independent of Him w'hile He <br/>
needs us. Were He independent of us He w ; ould not ask us to lend Him <br/>
our money as* your master pretends, prohibiting you to take interest and <br/>
allowing us to. Had He been independent of us He would not have given <br/>
us interest.’ 2 </p>
<p>Abu Bakr was enraged and hit Finhas hard in the face, saying, ‘Were <br/>
it not for the treaty between us I would cut off your head, you enemy of <br/>
Allah!’ Finhas immediately went to the apostle and said, ‘Look, Muham¬ <br/>
mad, at w’hat your companion has done.’ The apostle asked Abu Bakr <br/>
what had impelled him to do such a thing and he answered: ‘The enemy <br/>
of Allah spoke blasphemy. lie alleged that Allah was poor and that they 389 <br/>
were rich and I was so angry that I hit his face.’ Finhas contradicted this <br/>
and denied that he had said it, so Allah sent dowm refuting him and con¬ <br/>
firming what Abu Bakr had said: ‘Allah has heard the speech of those who <br/>
say: “Allah is poor and we are rich.’) We shall w'rite what they say and <br/>
their killing the prophets wrongfully and we shall say, Taste the punish¬ <br/>
ment of burning.’ 3 </p>
<p>And there came down concerning Abu Bakr and the anger that he felt: </p>
<p>‘And you will certainly hear from those who received the book before you <br/>
and from the polytheists much w r rong but if you persevere and fear God <br/>
that is of the steadfastness of things.’ </p>
<p>’Then He said concerning what Finhas and the other rabbis with him <br/>
said: ‘And when God laid a charge upon those who had received the book: </p>
<p>You are to make it clear to men and not to conceal it, they cast it behind </p>
<p>1 Sura 3. 114. </p>
<p>2 The key to this seemingly blasphemous utterance is in the words ‘as your master pre¬ <br/>
tends’. Later Muslim scholars would have called it an ilzdm, a form of the argumentum ad <br/>
absurdum in which an opponent's proposition is adopted and followed to its (absurd) conclu¬ <br/>
sion. The Jews had objected to contributing to the cost of the war against the Meccans, <br/>
saving that il God needed their money as the apostle said they must be better off than Hel </p>
<p>3 Sura 3. 177. </p>
<p>264 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>their backs and sold it for a small price. Wretched is the exchange! <br/>
Think not that those who rejoice in what they have done and want to be <br/>
praised for what they have not done—think not that they will escape the <br/>
punishment: theirs will be a painful punishment.’ 1 He means Finhas <br/>
and Ashya' and the rabbis like them who rejoice in what they enjoy of <br/>
worldly things bv making error attractive to men and wish to be praised <br/>
for what they have not done so that men will say they are learned when they <br/>
are nothing of the kind, not bringing them to truth and guidance and <br/>
wanting men to say that they have so done. </p>
<p>Kardam, Usama, Naff', Bahri, Huyayy, and Rifa'a 2 used to go to some <br/>
of the helpers advising them not to contribute to the public expenses, <br/>
Tor we fear that you will come to poverty. Don’t be in a hurry to contri- <br/>
390 bute, for you do not know the outcome.’ So God sent down concerning <br/>
them: ‘Who are avaricious and enjoin avarice on others concealing the <br/>
bounty they have received from God’, i.e. the Torah w r hich confirms what <br/>
Muhammad brought. 3 ‘We have prepared for the unbelievers a shameful <br/>
punishment, and those who spend their money to be seen of men and <br/>
believe not in God and the last day’ as far as the words ‘God knows about <br/>
them’. </p>
<p>Rifa'a was a notable Jew. When he spoke to the apostle he twisted his <br/>
tongue and said: ‘Give us your attention, Muhammad, so that we can <br/>
make you understand.’ Then he attacked Islam and reviled it. So God <br/>
sent down concerning him: ‘Hast thou considered those to whom a part <br/>
of the book has been given how they buy error and wish that you should <br/>
err as to the way. But God knows best about your enemies. God is <br/>
sufficient as a friend and helper. Some of the Jews change words from <br/>
their contexts and say: We hear and disobey; hear thou as one that heareth <br/>
not and listen to us, twisting their tongues and attacking religion. Had they <br/>
said, We hear and we obey; hear thou and look at us, it would have been <br/>
better for them and more upright. But God has cursed them for their <br/>
unbelief and only a few will believe.’ 4 </p>
<p>The apostle spoke to two of the chiefs of the Jewish rabbis 'Abdullah <br/>
b. Suriya al-A'war and Ka'b b. Asad calling on them to accept Islam, <br/>
for they knew that he had brought them the truth; but they denied that <br/>
they knew it and were obstinate in their unbelief. So God sent down <br/>
concerning them: ‘O you to whom the book was sent, Believe in what <br/>
We have sent down in confirmation of what you have before We efface </p>
<p>1 v. 184. </p>
<p>2 Their names have already been given in full. </p>
<p>3 One would naturally suppose that their wealth is referred to here. </p>
<p>4 Sura 4. 47. This text shows that Muhammad knew («) that when they said ‘We hear’ <br/>
and ‘apaynd they were playing on the similar-sounding Hebrew word astnu (with sin) mean¬ <br/>
ing ‘we carry out’, and ( b ) that ra'ina to them meant ‘our evil one’. It seems, therefore, <br/>
probable that ghayra musma'in is not to be understood in the sense given above, but as a <br/>
vocative, ‘O thou that hast not been made to hear’, i.e. thou who hast not received a divine <br/>
revelation. The ‘tongue-twisting’ is revealed as the sarcastic use of Arabic in a Hebrew <br/>
sense by a bilingual scholar. </p>

<p>And those who formed parties of Quraysh and Ghatafan ami B. Qurayza 39. <br/>
were Huyayy and Sallam and Abu Rafi' and al-Rabi' and Abu 'Ammfir and <br/>
Waliwah b. Amir, and Haudha b. Qays, the latter three being of B <br/>
\ ail while the rest were of B. al-Nadir. When they came to Quraysh <br/>
they told them that these were Jewish rabbis, the folk who possessed the <br/>
first (sacred) book, and they could ask them whether their religion or that <br/>
of Muhammad was the better. When they did ask them they answered- <br/>
Four religion is better than his and you are on a better path 'than he and <br/>
t ose who follow him.’ So God sent down concerning them: ‘Hast thou <br/>
considered those to whom a part of the book has been sent how they <br/>
beheve in al-Jibt and al-Taghut? (320). And they sav of those who <br/>
disbelieve: I hese are better guided to the right path'than those who <br/>
beheve as far as the words ’or are they envious of men because God has <br/>
given them of His bounty. We gave the family of Abraham the book <br/>
and wisdom and We gave them a great kingdom.’ 2 392 </p>
<p>Sukayn and 'Adiy b. Zayd said: ‘O Muhammad, we do not know of <br/>
God s having sent down to mortals anything after Moses.’ So God sent <br/>
down concerning their words: ‘We have revealed unto thee as we revealed <br/>
unto Noah and the prophets after him, and we revealed unto Abraham <br/>
and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the tribes and Jesus and Job and <br/>
Jonah and Aaron and Solomon and we brought to David the Psalms - and <br/>
apostles We have told thee of before and apostles We have not told thee of-■ <br/>
and God spoke directly to Moses; apostles bringing good news and warning <br/>
that men might have no argument against God after the apostles (had <br/>
come). God is Mighty, Wise.’ 3 V </p>
<p>A number of them came in to the apostle and he said to them, ‘Surely <br/>
you know that I am an apostle from God to you.’ They replied that they <br/>
did not know it and would not bear witness to him. So God sent down <br/>
concerning their words: ‘But God testifies concerning what He has sent <br/>
down to thee. With His knowledge did He send it down and the angels <br/>
bear witness. And God is sufficient as a witness.’ </p>
<p>The apostie went out to the B. al-Nadir to ask their help in the matter <br/>
of the blood-money of the two 'Amirites whom 'Amr b. Umavva al-Damri <br/>
had slam. And when they were alone together they said, ‘You will not <br/>
find Muhammad nearer than he is now; so what man will get on top of the <br/>
house and throw a stone on him so that we may be rid of him?’ 'Amr b <br/>
Jh b - Kab volunteered to do so. The apostle got to know of their <br/>
scheme and he left them and God sent down concerning him and his <br/>
people s intention: O you who believe, remember God’s favour to you </p>

<p>Nu'man b. Ada’ and Bahri b. 'Amr and Sha’s b. 'Adiy came to the apostle <br/>
393 and he invited them to come to God and warned them of His vengeance. <br/>
They replied: ‘You cannot frighten us, Muhammad. Wc are the sons and <br/>
the beloved of God’ as the Christians say. So God sent down concerning <br/>
them: ’And the Jews and the Christians say, We arc the sons and the <br/>
beloved of God. Say, Then why does He punish you for your sms? <br/>
Nav you are but mortals of those He has created. He pardons whom He <br/>
will and He punishes whom He will and to God belongs the kingdom of the <br/>
heavens and the earth and what lies between them and to Him is the </p>
<p>journeying.’ 1 . </p>
<p>The apostle invited the Jews to Islam and made it attractive to them <br/>
and warned them of God’s jealousy and His retribution ; but they repulsed <br/>
him and denied what he brought them. Mu'adh b. Jabal and Sa d b. <br/>
‘Ubada and 'Uqba b. Wahb said to them: ‘Fear God, for you know right <br/>
well that he is the apostle of God and you used to speak of him to us before <br/>
his mission and describe him to us.’ Rafi' b. Huraymila and Wahb b. <br/>
Yah fid ha said, ‘We never said that to you, and God has sent down no <br/>
book since Moses nor sent an evangelist or warner after him. So God <br/>
sent down concerning their words: ‘O scripture folk, our apostle has come <br/>
to you to make things plain to you after a cessation of apostles lest you <br/>
should say: No evangelist and no warner has come to us when an evangelist <br/>
and warner has come to you (now). God is able to do all things. </p>
<p>Then he recounted to them the story of Moses and their opposition to <br/>
him, and how they disobeyed God’s commands through him so that they <br/>
wandered in the wilderness forty years as a punishment. </p>
<p>Ibn Shihab al-Zuhrl told me that he heard a learned man of Muzayna <br/>
telling Sa'Id b. al-Musayyab that Abu Hurayra had told them that Jewish <br/>
rabbis had gathered in their school when the apostle came to Medina. <br/>
A married man had committed adultery with a married woman and they <br/>
said: ‘Send them to Muhammad and ask him what the law about them is <br/>
and leave the penalty to him. If he prescribes tajbih (which is scourging <br/>
with a rope of palm fibre smeared with pitch, the blackening of their <br/>
394 faces mounting on two donkeys with their faces to the animal s tail) <br/>
" then’follow him, for he is a king and believe in him. If he prescribes <br/>
stoning for them, he is a prophet so beware lest he deprive you of what you <br/>
hold ’ They brought the pair to Muhammad and explained the position. <br/>
The prophet walked to meet the rabbis in the school house and called on <br/>
them to bring out their learned men and they produced Abdullah . </p>
<p>’ One of the B. Qurayza told me that Abu Yasir and Wahb b. Yahudha <br/>
were with them and the apostle questioned them so that he got to the <br/>
bottom of their affair until they said (pointing) to 'Abdullah b. Suriya, <br/>
‘This is the most learned man living in the Torah’ (321). </p>
<p>I le was one of the youngest of them and when the apostle was alone </p>
<p>1 Sura 5. 21. The last word mrssir may mean ‘return . </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 267 </p>
<p>with him he put him on his oath as to whether the Forah did not prescribe <br/>
stoning for adulterers. ‘Yes,’ he said, ‘they know right well, AbiVl-Qasim, <br/>
that you arc a prophet sent (by God) but they envy you.’ The apostle <br/>
went out to them and commanded that the two should be stoned and they <br/>
y/ere stoned at the door of his mosque among B. Ghanm h. Malik b. <br/>
al-Najjar. Afterwatds Ibn Suriya disbelieved and denied that the apostle <br/>
was a prophet. So God sent down concerning them: ‘Q apostle, let not <br/>
those who vie with one another in unbelief sadden thee, those who say <br/>
with their mouths, We believe, but their hearts do not believe, those <br/>
Jews who listen to lies, listening for other people who do not come to <br/>
thee,’ i.e. those who sent others and stayed behind themselves and gave <br/>
them orders to change the judgement from its context. Then He said: <br/>
They change woids from their places, saying, If this be given to you 395 <br/>
receive it, and if it is not given to you, i.e. the stoning, beware of it’, See. </p>
<p>Muhammad b. Talha b. Yazld b. Rukana from Isma'll b. Ibrahim from <br/>
Ibn 'Abbas told me that the apostle ordered them to be stoned, and they <br/>
w : cre stoned at the door of his mosque. And when the Jew’ felt the first <br/>
stone he crouched over the woman to protect her from 'the stones until <br/>
both of them were killed. 'I his is what God did for the apostle m exacting <br/>
the penalty for adultery from the pair. </p>
<p>Salih b. Kaisan from NafY, freedman of 'Abdullah b. 'Umar from <br/>
Abdullah b. Umar, told me: When the apostle gave judgement about them <br/>
he asked for a 1 orah. A rabbi sat there reading it having put his hand over <br/>
the verse of stoning. 'Abdullah b. Salam struck the rabbi’s hand, saying, <br/>
‘This, O prophet of God, is the verse of stoning which he refuses to read <br/>
to you. The apostle said, ‘Woe to you Jews! What has induced you to <br/>
abandon the judgement of God which you hold in your hands?’ They <br/>
answered: ‘The sentence used to be carried out until a man of royal birth <br/>
and noble origin committed adultery and the king refused to allow him to <br/>
be stoned. Later another man committed adultery and the king wanted <br/>
him to be stoned but they said No, not until you stone so-and-so. And <br/>
when they said that to him they agreed to arrange the matter by tajbih and <br/>
they did away with all mention of stoning.’ The apostle said: ‘1 am the <br/>
first to revive the order of God and His book and to practise it.’ They <br/>
were duly stoned and 'Abdullah b. ‘Umar said, ‘I was among those that <br/>
stoned them.’ </p>
<p>Da’ud b. al-Husayn from Tkrima from Ibn 'Abbas said that the verses <br/>
of The Tabic in which God said: ‘Then judge between them or withdraw <br/>
from them and if you withdraw from them they will do thee no harm. And <br/>
if thou judgest, judge with fairness, for God loveth those who deal fairly’ 396 <br/>
were sent down concerning the blood-money between B. al-Nadlr and B. <br/>
Qurayza. those slain from B. al-Nadir were leaders and they wanted the <br/>
whole blood wit while B. Qurayza wanted half of it. They* referred the <br/>
matter for arbitration to the apostle, and God sent down that passage- <br/>
concerning them. The apostle ordered that the matter should be settled </p>
<p>268 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>justly and awarded the bloodwit in equal shares. But God knows which <br/>
account is correct. </p>
<p>Ka'b b. Asad and Ibn Saluba and his son 'Abdullah and Sha’s said one <br/>
to another, ‘Let us go to Muhammad to see if we can seduce him from his <br/>
religion, for he is only a mortal’; so they went to him and said: ‘You know, <br/>
Muhammad, that we are the rabbis, nobles, and leaders of the Jews; <br/>
and if we follow you the rest of the Jews will follow you and not oppose <br/>
us. Now we have a quarrel outstanding with some of our people and if we <br/>
believe in you and say that you are truthful will you, if we appoint you <br/>
arbitrator between us, give judgement in our favour ?’ The apostle refused <br/>
to do so and God sent down concerning them: ‘And judge between them <br/>
by what God has sent down and follow not their vain desires; and beware <br/>
of them lest they seduce thee from some of what God has sent down to thee. <br/>
And if they turn their backs then know that God wishes to smite them for <br/>
some of their sins. Many men are evil-doers. Is it that they are seeking <br/>
the judgement of paganism? Who is better than God in judgement for a <br/>
people who are certain?’ 1 </p>
<p>Abu Yasir and Nafi' b. Abu Naff' and 'Azir and Khalid and Zayd and <br/>
Izar and Ashya' came to the apostle and asked him about the apostles he <br/>
believed in. So the apostle said: ‘We believe in God and what he has sent <br/>
down to us and what was sent down to Abraham and Isbmael and Isaac <br/>
and Jacob and the tribes and what was given to Moses and Jesus and what <br/>
was given to the prophets from their Lord; we make no difference between <br/>
any one of them. And we are submissive unto Him.’ 2 When he mentioned <br/>
Jesus, Son of Mary, they denied that he was a prophet, saying, ‘We do not <br/>
397 believe in Jesus, Son of Mary, or in anyone who believes in him.’ So God <br/>
sent down concerning them: ‘O Scripture folk, do you blame us for any¬ <br/>
thing but our belief in God and what He has sent down to us and what was <br/>
sent down aforetime and because most of you are evil-doers?’ 3 </p>
<p>Rafi' b. Haritha and Sallam b. Mishkam and Malik b. al-Sayf and Rah' <br/>
b. Huraymila came to him and said: ‘Do you not allege that you follow <br/>
the religion of Abraham and believe in the Torah which we have and <br/>
testify that it is the truth from God?’ He replied, ‘Certainly, but you have <br/>
sinned and broken the covenant contained therein and concealed what you <br/>
were ordered to make plain to men, and I dissociate myself from your sin.’ <br/>
They said, ‘We hold by what we have. We live according to the guidance <br/>
and the truth and we do not believe in you and we will not follow you.’ <br/>
So God sent down concerning them: ‘Say, O Scripture folk, you have no <br/>
standing until you observe the Torah and the Gospel and what has been <br/>
sent down to you from your Lotd. What has been sent down to thee from <br/>
thy Lord will assuredly increase many of them in error and unbelief. <br/>
But be not sad because of the unbelieving people.’ 4 </p>
<p>Al-Nahham and Qardam and Bahrl came and said to him: ‘Do you not </p>
<p>2 Sura 3. 5K. </p>
<p>4 Sura 5. 72. </p>
<p>’ Sura 5. 54. <br/>
3 Sura 5. 64. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 269 </p>
<p>know that there is another god with God:’ The apostle answered: ‘God, <br/>
there is no God but lie. With that (message) I was sent and that I preach.’ </p>
<p>God sent down concerning their words: ‘Sav, What is the greatest testi¬ <br/>
mony? Say God is witness between me and you, and this Quran has been <br/>
revealed to me that I might warn you by it and whomsoever it reaches. </p>
<p>Do you actually testify that with God there are other gods ? Say, I do not <br/>
testify to that. Say He is only One God, and I dissociate myself from what <br/>
you associate (with Him). Those to whom We sent the book know it as <br/>
they know their own sons. Those who destroy themselves will not believe.’ 1 </p>
<p>Rifa'a and Suwayd had hypocritically affected to embrace Islam and <br/>
some of the Muslims were friendly with them. So God sent down con¬ <br/>
cerning these two men: ‘O Believers, choose not as friends those who have <br/>
chosen your religion to make a jest and game of it from among those who <br/>
received the scripture before you, nor the unbelievers, and fear God if 398 <br/>
you are believers’, as far as the words ‘And when they come to you they <br/>
say, We believe, but they came in in unbelief and they went out with it and <br/>
God knows best about what they are concealing.’ 2 </p>
<p>Jabal and Shamwil came to the apostle and said: ‘Tell us when the hour <br/>
will be if you are a prophet as you say.’ So God sent down concerning <br/>
them: ‘They will ask you about the hour when it will come to pass. Say, <br/>
only my Lord knows of it. None but He will reveal it at its proper time. </p>
<p>It is heavy in the heavens and the earth. Suddenly will it come upon you. <br/>
They will ask you as though you knew about it. Say Only God knows <br/>
about it, but most men do not know’-’ (322). </p>
<p>Sallam and Nu'man b. Aufa and Mahmud b. Dihya and Sha’s and <br/>
Malik came and said to him: ‘How can we follow you when you have <br/>
abandoned our Qihla and you do not allege that 'Uzayr is the son of God ?’ 399 <br/>
So God sent down concerning these words: ‘The Jews say that 'Uzayr <br/>
is the son of God and the Christians say the Messiah is the son of God. <br/>
That is what they say with their mouths copying the speech of those who <br/>
disbelieved aforetime. God fight them! How perverse they are’ to the <br/>
end of the passage 4 (323). </p>
<p>Mahmud b. Sayhan and Nu'man b. Ada’ and Bahrl and 'Uzayr and <br/>
Sallam came to him and said: ‘Is it true, Muhammad, that what you have <br/>
brought is the truth from God? For our part we cannot see that it is <br/>
arranged as the Torah is.’ He answered, ‘You know quite well that it is <br/>
from God; you will find it written in the Torah which you have. If men <br/>
and jinn came together to produce its like they could not.’ Finhas and <br/>
'Abdullah b. Suriya and Ibn Saluba and Kinana b. al RabI' and Ashva' <br/>
and Ka'b b. al-Asad and Shamwil and Jabal were there and they said: </p>
<p>‘Did neither men nor jinn tell you this, Muhammad ?’ He said: ‘You know </p>
<p>1 The charge of polytheism made against the Jews is very puzzling and hard to explain. <br/>
Certainly this passage (Sura 6. 19) and the context in which it occurs refers not to the Jews <br/>
but to the polytheists. 2 bum 5. (&gt;2. </p>
<p>3 Sura 7. 186. To make sense \ve must supply the words ‘that they do not know’ at the <br/>
end. 4 SG ra 9. 30. </p>
<p>270 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>well that it is from God and that I am the apostle of God. You will find <br/>
it written in the Torah you have.’ They said: ‘When God sends an apostle <br/>
He does for him what he wishes, so bring down a book to us from heaven <br/>
that we may read it and know what it is, otherwise we will produce one <br/>
like the one you bring.’ So God sent down concerning their words: <br/>
‘Sav, Though men and jinn should meet to produce the like of this Quran <br/>
they would not produce its like though one helped the other’ 1 (324). </p>
<p>400 Huyayy, Ka'b, Abu Raft', Ashya', and Shamwll said to 'Abdullah b. <br/>
Salam when he became a Muslim, ‘There is no prophecy among the Arabs, <br/>
but your master is a king.’ Then they went to the apostle and asked him <br/>
about Dhu’l-Qarnayn and he told them what God had sent him about <br/>
him from what he had already narrated to Quraysh. They were of those <br/>
who ordered Quraysh to ask the apostle about him when they sent ah Nad r <br/>
and 'Uqba to them. 2 </p>
<p>I was told that Sa'id b. Jubayr said: A number of Jews came to the apostle <br/>
and said: ‘Now, Muhammad, Allah created creation, but who created <br/>
Allah?’ The apostle was so angry that his colour changed and he rushed <br/>
at them being indignant for his Lord. Gabriel came and quietened him <br/>
saying, ‘Calm yourself, O Muhammad.’ And an answer to what they asked <br/>
came to him from God: ‘Say, He God is One. God the Eternal. He <br/>
begetteth not neither is He begotten and there is none equal to Him.’ 3 <br/>
When he recited that to them they said, ‘Describe His shape to us, <br/>
Muhammad; his forearm and his upper arm, what are they like?’ The <br/>
apostle was more angry than before and rushed at them. Gabriel came to <br/>
him and spoke as before. And an answer to what they asked came to him <br/>
from God: ‘They think not of God as He ought to be thought of; the <br/>
whole earth will be in His grasp at the day of resurrection and the heavens <br/>
folded up in His right hand. Glorified and Exalted is He above what they <br/>
associate with Him.’ 4 </p>
<p>'Utba b. Muslim freedman of the B. Taym from Abu Salama b. <br/>
'Abdu’l-Rahman from Abu Hurayra told me: I heard the apostle say, <br/>
‘Men question their prophet 5 to such an extent that one would almost <br/>
say, Now God created creation, but who created God ? And if they say <br/>
that, say ye: He God is One,’ &amp;c. Then let a man spit three times to the <br/>
left and say ‘I take refuge in God from Satan the damned’ (325). </p>
<p>401 A DEPUTATION FROM THE CHRISTIANS OF NAJRAN </p>
<p>A deputation from the Christians of Najran came to the apostle. There <br/>
were sixty riders, fourteen of them from their nobles of whom three were <br/>
in control of affairs, namely {a) the 'Aqib the leader of the people, a man <br/>
of affairs, and their chief adviser whose opinion governed their policy, </p>

<p>'Abdu’l-MasTh by name; ( b ) the Sayyid , their administrator who saw r to <br/>
transport and general arrangements, whose name was al-Ayham; and <br/>
(c) their Bishop, scholar, and religious leader who controlled their schools, </p>
<p>Abu Haritha b. 'Alqama, one of B. Bakr b. Wa’il. </p>
<p>Abu Haritha occupied a position of honour among them, and was a <br/>
great student, so that he had an excellent knowledge of their religion, and <br/>
the Christian kings of Byzantium had honoured him and paid him a sub¬ <br/>
sidy and gave him servants, built churches for him and lavished honours <br/>
on him, because of his knowledge and zeal for their religion. </p>
<p>When they set out 1 from Najran to see the apostle Abu Haritha was <br/>
riding on a mule of his with a brother at his side whose name was Kuz b. <br/>
'Alqama (326). Abu Haritha’s mule stumbled and Kuz said, ‘May So-and- <br/>
so stumble,’ [i.e. Curse him!], meaning the apostle. Abu Haritha said, ‘Nay <br/>
but may you stumble.’ ‘But why, brother ?’ he asked. ‘Because by God he <br/>
is the prophet we have been waiting for.’ Kuz said, ‘Then if you know <br/>
that, what stops you from accepting him?’ He replied, ‘The way these <br/>
people have treated us. They have given us titles, paid us subsidies, and <br/>
honoured us. But they arc absolutely opposed to him, and if I were to <br/>
accept him they would take from us all that you see.’ Kuz pondered over <br/>
the matter until later he adopted Islam, and used to tell this story, so I <br/>
have heard (327). </p>
<p>Muhammad b. Ja'far b. al-Zubayr told me that when they came to <br/>
Medina they came into the apostle’s mosque as he prayed the afternoon <br/>
prayer clad in YamanI garments, cloaks, and mantles, with the elegance of <br/>
men of B. al-IIarith b. Ka'b. The prophet’s companions who saw them <br/>
that day said that they never saw their like in any deputation that came <br/>
afterwards. The time of their prayers having come they stood and prayed <br/>
in the apostle’s mosque, and he said that they w r ere to be left to do so. <br/>
They prayed towards the east. </p>
<p>The names of the fourteen principal men among the sixty riders were: <br/>
'Abdu’l-Masih the 'Aqib, al-Ayham the Sayyid; Abu Haritha b. 'Alqama <br/>
brother of B. Bakr b. Wa’il; Aus; al-Harith; Zayd; Qays; Yazid ; Nubayh; 403 <br/>
Khuwaylid; 'Amr; Khalid; 'Abdullah; Johannes; of these the first three <br/>
named above spoke to the apostle. They were Christians according <br/>
to the Byzantine rite, though they differed among themselves in some <br/>
points, saying He is God; and He is the son of God; and He is the third <br/>
person of the Trinity, which is the doctrine of Christianity. They argue <br/>
that he is God because he used to raise the dead, and heal the sick, and <br/>
declare the unseen; and make clay birds and then breathe into them so <br/>
that they flew away; 2 and all this was bv the command of God Almighty, </p>
<p>‘W e will make him a sign to men.’ 3 They argue that he is the son of God in <br/>
that they say he had no known father; and he spoke in the cradle and this <br/>
is something that no child of Adam has ever done. They argue that he is <br/>
the third of three in that God says: We have done, We have commanded, </p>
<p>1 Reading wajjahu with W. 2 Sura 3. 43. 3 Sura 19. 21. </p>
<p>4°4 </p>
<p>272 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>We have created and We have decreed, and they say, If He were one he <br/>
would have said I have done, I have created, and soon, but He is He and <br/>
Jesus and Mary. Concerning all these assertions the Quran came down. </p>
<p>When the two divines spoke to him the apostle said to them, ‘Submit <br/>
yourselves.’ 1 They said, ‘We have submitted.’ He said: ‘You have not <br/>
submitted, so submit.’ They said, ‘Nay, but we submitted before you.’ <br/>
He said, ‘You lie. Your assertion that God has a son, your worship of the <br/>
cross, and your eating pork hold you back from submission.’ They said, <br/>
‘But who is his father, Muhammad?’ The apostle was silent and did not <br/>
answer them. So God sent down concerning their words and their in¬ <br/>
coherence the beginning of the sura of the Family of 'Imran up to more <br/>
than eighty verses, and He said: ‘Alif Lam Mlm. God there is no God but <br/>
He the Living the Ever-existent.’ 2 Thus the sura begins with the statement <br/>
that He transcends what they say, and His oneness in creation and autho¬ <br/>
rity, without associate therein, in refutation of the infidelity they have <br/>
invented, and their making rivals to Him; and using their own arguments <br/>
against them in reference to their master to show them their error thereby. <br/>
‘God there is no God but He,’ no associate is with Him in His authority. <br/>
‘The Living the Ever-existent,’ the living Who cannot die, whereas Jesus <br/>
died and was crucified according to their doctrine; ‘The Ever-existent’ one <br/>
who remains unceasingly in the place of His sovereignty in His creation, <br/>
whereas Jesus, according to their doctrine, removed from the place where <br/>
he was and went from it elsewhere. ‘He has brought down to thee the book <br/>
in truth,’ i.e. with the truth about which they differ. ‘And He sent down <br/>
the Torah and the Gospel,’ the Torah to Moses and the Gospel to Jesus, <br/>
as He sent down books to those who were before him. ‘And He sent down <br/>
the Criterion,’ i.e. the distinction between truth and falsehood about <br/>
which the sects differ in regard to the nature 3 of Jesus and other matters. <br/>
‘Those who disbelieve in God’s signs will have a severe punishment. God <br/>
is Mighty, Vengeful,’ i.e. God will take vengeance on all who deny His <br/>
signs, after knowing about them and about what comes from Him in them. <br/>
‘Nothing in heaven or earth is hidden from God,’ i.e. He knows what they <br/>
intend and scheme and what comparison they seek to establish in their <br/>
doctrine of Jesus when they make him God and Lord, when they possess <br/>
the knowledge that he is nothing of the kind, thus behaving with insolence <br/>
and infidelity. ‘He it is who forms you in the womb as He pleases,’ i.e. <br/>
Jesus was one who was formed in the womb—they do not attempt to deny <br/>
that—like every other child of Adam, so how can he be God when he had <br/>
occupied such a place? Then He says, to lift His transcendence and <br/>
His essential Unity above what they put with Him, ‘There is no God but <br/>
He the Mighty the Wise.’ The Mighty in Ilis victory over those who deny </p>
<p>1 The ordinary meaning of the word must stand here. Muhammad, of course, meant <br/>
‘Become Muslims’. The Christians answered that they had already submitted themselves <br/>
to Cod—sec what was said on p. 1 79 - 2 3 ' T - </p>
<p>3 Not in the theological sense, though undoubtedly christological differences form the <br/>
background of this sura. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 273 </p>
<p>Him when He wills, and the Wise in Ilis argument and His case against <br/>
His creatures. ‘He it is who has sent down to thee the book which has <br/>
plain verses: they arc the core 1 of the book’, in them is the divine argument, <br/>
the protection of (His) creatures, and the thrusting aside of controversy <br/>
and falsehood. These are not subject to modification or alteration 2 in the <br/>
meaning which has been given. ‘And others are obscure’, they are subject <br/>
to modification and interpretation. By them God tests His creatures as He <br/>
tests them with things permitted and forbidden that they should not be <br/>
changed into what is false and altered by declining from the truth. ‘But <br/>
as to those in whose hearts is a deviation, i.e. turning away from true <br/>
guidance, ‘they follow what is ambiguous,’ i.e. what can be otherwise <br/>
interpreted to substantiate thereby what they have invented and introduced <br/>
anew that they may have an argument and a plausible reason for their doc¬ <br/>
trine, ‘desiring fitna,' i.e. confusion, and ‘desiring an arbitrary interpreta¬ <br/>
tion,’ e.g. the error they adopted in explaining ‘We created’ and ‘We <br/>
decreed’. ‘And none knows its interpretation,’ i.e. what they mean by it, <br/>
‘except God; and those grounded in knowledge. They say, We believe in <br/>
it. Everything comes from our Lord.’ So how can there be any contro¬ <br/>
versy when it is one speech from one Lord ? Then they carry over the 405 <br/>
inteipretation of the obscure to the plain which can have only one meaning <br/>
and thus the book becomes consistent, one part confirming another, the <br/>
argument effective and the case clear; falsehood is excluded and unbelief <br/>
is overcome. ‘None but the intelligent take heed’ in this way. ‘0 Lord, <br/>
Suffer not our hearts to go astray after Thou hast guided us,’ i.e. Do not let <br/>
our hearts swerve, though wc swerve aside through our sins. ‘Grant us <br/>
mercy from Thy presence. Thou art the Generous Giver.’ Then He says, </p>
<p>God witnesses that there is no God but He, and the angels and the men <br/>
of knowledge too’ contrary to what they say ‘subsisting ever in justice,’ i.e. <br/>
in equity. There is no God but He the IMighty the Wise. The religion <br/>
with God is Islam,’ i.e. the religion you practise, O Muhammad, aeknow- <br/>
ledging the oneness of God iind confirming the apostles. ‘ 1 hose to whom <br/>
the book was brought differed only after knowledge had come to them,’ j.e. <br/>
that which came to thee, namely that God is One without associate, <br/>
‘through transgression among themselves. And whosoever disbelieves in <br/>
God’s revelations—God is swift to take into account. And if they argue <br/>
with thee,’ i.e. with the false doctrine they produce about ‘Wc created,.’ </p>
<p>1 Lit. ‘the mother’. </p>
<ul>
<li>two words used, tasrif and tahrif, are not always dearly defined by the Arab com¬ <br/>
mentators. Lane says that the lasrif of the verses means ‘the varying or diversifying of the <br/>
verses of the Quran by repeating them in different forms, or the making of them distinct in <br/>
their meanings by repeating and varying them’. As to tahrif, Buhl’s article in E.I. should <br/>
be consulted: ‘It may happen in various ways, by direct alteration of the written text, by <br/>
arbitrary alterations in reading aloud the text which is itself correct, by omitting parts of it <br/>
or by interpolations or by a wrong exposition of the true sense. . . .’ Ibn Ishaq says that <br/>
neither the plain nor the obscure verses may be treated with tahrif - hut in the iatter category <br/>
tahrif and interpretation may be resorted to—i.e. a meaning may be given to them which <br/>
the words taken as they stand do not justify. </li>
</ul>
<p>B 4080 </p>
<p>T </p>
<p>274 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>‘We did’, and ‘We commanded’, it is only a specious argument devoid of <br/>
truth. ‘Say, I have surrendered my purpose 1 to God,’ i.e. to Him alone, ‘as <br/>
have those who follow me. And say to those who received the book and <br/>
to the gentile (converts) who have no book, ‘Have you surrendered? For <br/>
if they have surrendered they will be rightly guided and if they turn their <br/>
backs it is only incumbent on thee to deliver the message. And God sees <br/>
(His) servants.’ </p>
<p>Then He combined the Jews and Christians and reminded them of <br/>
what they had newly invented and said: ‘Those who disbelieve in God’s <br/>
revelations and kill the prophets wrongfully and kill men who enjoin <br/>
justice’ as far as the words, ‘Say, O God possessor of sovereignty,’ i.e. <br/>
Lord of mankind and the King who alone decrees among them. ‘Thou <br/>
givest sovereignty to whom Thou wilt and takest it aw r ay from whom <br/>
Thou wilt. Thou exaltest and abasest whom Thou wilt; in Thy hand is <br/>
good,’ i.e. there is no God but Thee. ‘Thou canst do all things,’ i.e. none <br/>
406 but Thou can do this in thy majesty and power. ‘Thou causest the night <br/>
to pass into day and the day into night and bringest forth the living from <br/>
the dead and the dead from the living’ by that power. ‘And Thou nur- <br/>
turest whom Thou wilt without stint.’ None has power to do that but <br/>
Thou; i.e. though I gave Jesus power over those matters in virtue of which <br/>
they say that he is God such as raising the dead, healing the sick, creating <br/>
birds of clay, and declaring the unseen, I made him thereby a sign to men <br/>
and a confirmation of his prophethood wherewith I sent him to his people. <br/>
But some of My majesty and power I withheld from him such as appoint¬ <br/>
ing kings by a prophetic command and placing them where I wished, and <br/>
making the night to pass into day and the day into night and bringing <br/>
forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living and nurturing <br/>
whom I wall without stint, both the good and the evil man. All that I <br/>
withheld from Jesus and gave him no power over it. Have they not an <br/>
example and a clear proof that if he were a God all that would be within <br/>
his power, while they know that he fled from kings and because of them <br/>
he moved about the country from town to town. </p>
<p>Then he admonished and warned the believers and said: ‘Say, If you <br/>
love God,’ i.e. if w r hat you say is true in love to God and in glorifying Him <br/>
‘and follow 1 me, God will love you and forgive you your sins,’ i.e. your past <br/>
unbelief. ‘And God is Forgiving Merciful. Say, Obey God and His <br/>
apostle,’ for you know him and find him (mentioned) in your book. ‘But if <br/>
you turn back,’ i.e. to your unbelief, ‘God loveth not the unbelievers.’ </p>
<p>Then He explained to them how what God intended to do with Jesus <br/>
originated and said; ‘God chose Adam and Noah and the family of Abra¬ <br/>
ham and the family of 'Imran above the worlds. They were descendants <br/>
one of another and God is a Hearer, a Knower.’ Then he mentioned the <br/>
affair of 'Imran’s wife and how- she said: ‘My Lord, I vow to Thee what is <br/>
in my womb as a consecrated offering,’ i.e. I have vowed him and made </p>
<p>1 zvajki. </p>

<p>The Life of Muhammad 277 </p>
<p>a male is no more wonderful than this. 'Whoso argues with thee about him <br/>
after knowledge has come to thee,’ i.e. after I have told thee his story and <br/>
how his affair was, ‘Then say: Come, let us summon our sons and your <br/>
sons, our wives and your wives, ourselves and yourselves, then let us pray <br/>
earnestly 5 and invoke God’s curse upon the liars’ (331)- ‘Verily this’ which 410 <br/>
I have brought you of the story of Jesus ‘is the true story’ of his affair. <br/>
‘There is no God but God, and God is Mighty Wise. If they turn back <br/>
God knows about the corrupt doers. Say, O Scripture folk, Come to a <br/>
just word between us that we will worship only God and associate nothing <br/>
with Him and some of us will not take others as lords beside God. And if <br/>
they turn back say: Bear witness that we are Muslims.’ Thus he invited <br/>
them to justice and deprived them of their argument. </p>
<p>When there came to the apostle news of Jesus from God and a decisive <br/>
judgement between him and them, and he was commanded to resort to <br/>
mutual invocation of a curse if they opposed him, he summoned them to <br/>
begin. But they said: ‘O Abu ’ 1 -Qasim, let us consider our affairs; then we <br/>
will come to you later with our decision.’ So they left him and consulted <br/>
.with the 'Aqib who was their chief adviser and asked him what his opinion <br/>
was. He said: ‘O Christians, you know right well that Muhammad is a <br/>
prophet sent (by God) and he has brought a decisive declaration about the <br/>
nature of your master. You know too that a people has never invoked a <br/>
curse on a prophet and seen its elders live and its youth grow up. If you <br/>
do this you will be exterminated. But if you decide to adhere to your <br/>
religion and to maintain your doctrine about your master, then take your <br/>
leave of the man and go home.’ So they came to the apostle and told him <br/>
that they had decided not to resort to cursing and to leave him in his <br/>
religion and return home. But they would like him to send a man he could <br/>
trust to decide between them in certain financial matters in dispute among <br/>
them. </p>
<p>Muhammad b. Ja'far said: The apostle said, ‘If you come to me this <br/>
evening I will send a firm and trusty man.’ 'Umar used to say, ‘I never <br/>
wanted an office more than I wanted that one and hoped that I should get <br/>
it. I went to the noon prayer in the heat and when the apostle had con¬ <br/>
cluded it he looked to right and left and I began to stretch myself to my <br/>
full height so that he could see me; but he kept on searching with his eyes <br/>
until he saw Abu 'Ubayda b. al-Jarrah and calling him he said, “Go with 411 <br/>
them and judge between them faithfully in matters they dispute about.’” </p>
<p>So, said 'Umar, Abu 'Ubayda went with them. </p>
<p>SOME ACCOUNT OF THE HYPOCRITES </p>
<p>'Asim b. 'Umar b. Qatada told me that when the apostle came to Medina <br/>
the leader there was 'Abdullah b. Ubayy b. Salul al-'Aufi of the clan of B. <br/>
al-Hublii; none of his own people contested his authority and Aus and </p>
<p>1 As the sequel shows, the meaning is ‘let us invoke God’s curse on which of us is K ing’. </p>
<p>278 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Khazraj never rallied to one man before or after him until Islam came, as <br/>
they did to him. With him was a man of Aus whom Aus obeyed, Abu <br/>
‘Amir 'Abdu 'Amr b. Sayfl b. al-Nu'man, one of 13 . Dubay'a b. Zayd, <br/>
the father of Ilanzala, ‘the washed’ on the day of Uhud. 1 He had been an <br/>
ascetic in pagan days and had worn a coarse hair garment and was called the <br/>
monk’. These two men were damned through their high status and it did <br/>
them harm. </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. Ubayy’s people had made a sort of jewelled diadem to <br/>
crown him and make him their king when God sent His apostle to them, <br/>
so when his people forsook him in favour of Islam he was filled with cn~ <br/>
mitv realizing that the apostle had deprived him of his kingship. However, <br/>
when he saw that his people w r ere determined to go over to Islam he went <br/>
too, but unwillingly, retaining his enmity and dissimulating. </p>
<p>Abu 'Amir stubbornly refused to believe and abandoned his people <br/>
when they went over to Islam and -went off to Mecca w r ith about ten fol¬ <br/>
lowers to get away from Islam and the apostle. Muhammad b. Abu <br/>
Umama from one of the family of Hanzala b. Abu Amir told me that the <br/>
apostle said, ‘Don’t call him the monk but the evil-doer.’ </p>
<p>Ja'far b. 'Abdullah b. Abu’l-Hakam whose memory went back to aposto¬ <br/>
lic days and who was a narrator of tradition told me that before he left for <br/>
Mecca Abu 'Amir came to the apostle in Medina to ask him about the <br/>
religion he had brought. </p>
<p>‘The Hanlflya, the religion of Abraham.’ </p>
<p>‘That is what I follow.’ </p>
<p>412 ‘You do not.’ </p>
<p>‘But I do! You, Muhammad, have introduced into the Hanlflya things <br/>
which do not belong to it.’ </p>
<p>‘I have not. I have brought it pure and white.’ </p>
<p>‘May God let the liar die a lonely, homeless, fugitive!’ (meaning the <br/>
apostle as if he had falsified his religion). </p>
<p>‘Well and good. May God so reward him!’ </p>
<p>That actually happened to the enemy of God. He went to Mecca and <br/>
when the apostle conquered it he went to Ta’if; when Ta if became Mus¬ <br/>
lim he went to Syria and died there a lonely, homeless, fugitive. </p>
<p>Now there went with him 'Alqama b. 'Ulatha b. 'Auf b. al-Ahwas b. <br/>
Ja'far b. Kilab, and Kinana b. 'Abd Yalil b. 'Amr b. 'Umayr al-Thaqafl. <br/>
When he died they brought their rival claims to his property before Caesar, <br/>
lord of Rome. 2 fcaesar said, ‘Let townsmen inherit townsmen and let <br/>
nomads inherit nomads.’ So Kinana b. *Abd A alii inherited his property <br/>
and not 'Alqama. </p>
<p>Ka'b b. Malik said of Abu 'Amir and what he had done: </p>
<p>God save me from an evil deed </p>
<p>Like yours against your clan, O 'Abdu 'Amr. </p>
<p>2 i.e. Nova Roma. </p>
<p>279 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>You said, ‘I have honour and wealth’, </p>
<p>But of old you sold your faith for infidelity (332). </p>
<p>‘Abdullah b. Ubayy while maintaining his position among his people <br/>
kept wavering until finally he adopted Islam unwillingly. </p>
<p>Muhammad b. Muslim al-Zuhri from 'Urwa b. al-Zubayr from Usama <br/>
b. Zayd b. Haritha, the beloved friend of the apostle, told me that the <br/>
apostle rode to Sa'd b. 'Ubada to visit him during his illness, mounted on <br/>
an ass with a saddle surmounted by a cloth of Fadak with a bridle of palm- <br/>
fibre. Said Zayd: ‘The apostle gave me a seat behind him. He passed <br/>
'Abdullah b. Ubayy as he was sitting in the shade of his fort Muzaham <br/>
(333). Round him were sitting some of his men, and when the apostle saw <br/>
him his sense of politeness would not allow him to pass without alighting. 413 <br/>
So he got off the animal and sat for a little while reciting the Quran and <br/>
inviting him to God. He admonished and warned him and preached the <br/>
good news to him while he, with his nose in the air, uttered not a word. <br/>
Finally, when the apostle had finished speaking he said, “There would be <br/>
nothing finer than w r hat you say if it were true. But sit in your own house <br/>
and if anyone comes, talk to him about it; but don’t importune those who <br/>
do not come to you, and don’t come into a man’s gathering with talk which <br/>
he docs not like.” 'Abdullah b. Rawaha, who was one of the Muslims who <br/>
were sitting with him, said, “Nay, do come to us with it and come into our <br/>
gatherings and quarters and houses. For by God it is what we love and <br/>
what God has honoured us with, and guided us to.” When 'Abdullah b. <br/>
Ubayy saw that his people were opposed to him he said: </p>
<p>When your friend is your opponent you will always be humiliated </p>
<p>And your adversaries will overthrow you. 1 </p>
<p>Can the falcon mount without his wings? </p>
<p>If his feathers are clipped he falls to the ground (334). </p>
<p>‘Al-Zuhri from 'Urwa b. al-Zubayr from Usama told me that the <br/>
apostle got up and went into the house of Sa'd b. 'Ubada, his face showing <br/>
the emotions raised by I bn Ubayy, the enemy of God. Sa'd asked the <br/>
apostle why he looked so angry as though he had heard something that <br/>
displeased him, and then he told him what Ibn Ubayy had said. Sa'd said: <br/>
‘Don’t be hard on him; for God sent you to us as we were making a diadem <br/>
to crown him, and by God he thinks that you have robbed him of a king¬ <br/>
dom.’ </p>
<p>FEVER ATTACKS THE APOSTLE’S COMPANIONS </p>
<p>Hisham b. 'Urwa and 'Umar b. 'Abdullah b. 'Urwa from 'Urwa b. al- <br/>
Zubayr told me that 'A’isha said: When his apostle came to Medina it </p>
<p>1 Ibn Qutayba, Muqaddima, tr. Gaudefroy-Demombynes, Paris, 1947, p. 22, has vn'Iuka <br/>
for y« sraka. G.-D. translates maulaka by ’ton patron’. The word is a homonym and in <br/>
its context seems to require the meaning I have given. </p>
<p>280 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>was the most fever-infested land on earth, and his companions suffered </p>
<p>414 severely from it, though God kept it from His apostle. 'Amir b. Fuhayra <br/>
and Bilal, freedmen of Abu Bakr, were with him in one house when the <br/>
fever attacked them, and I came in to visit them, for the veil had not then <br/>
been ordered for us. Only God knows how much they suffered from the <br/>
fever. I came to my father and asked him how he fared and he said: </p>
<p>Any man might be greeted by his family in the morning <br/>
While death was nearer than the thong of his sandal. </p>
<p>I thought that my father did not know what he was saying. Then I went to <br/>
'Amir and asked him how he was and he said: </p>
<p>I have experienced death before actually tasting it: </p>
<p>The coward’s death comes upon him as he sits. </p>
<p>Every man resists it with all his might </p>
<p>Like the ox who protects his body with his horns (335). </p>
<p>I thought that 'Amir did not know' what he was saying. Bilal when the <br/>
fever left him lay prostrate in a corner of the house. Then he lifted up his <br/>
voice and said: </p>
<p>Shall I ever spend a night again in Fakhkh 1 <br/>
With sweet herbs and thyme around me? </p>
<p>Will the day dawm when I come down to the waters of Majanna <br/>
Shall I ever see Shama and Tafll again? (336) </p>
<p>I told the apostle what they had said and he remarked that they were <br/>
delirious and out of their minds with a high temperature. He said, “O God, <br/>
make Medina as dear to us as Mecca and even dearer! And bless to us its <br/>
food, and carry its fever to Mahya'a.” Mahya'a is al-Juhfa.’ 2 </p>
<p>Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri from 'Abdullah b. 'Amr b. al- As mentioned that, <br/>
when the apostle came to Medina with his companions, the fever of Medina <br/>
smote them until they were extremely ill (though God turned it away from </p>
<p>415 his prophet) to such a degree that they could only pray sitting. The apostle <br/>
came out to them when they were praying thus and said: ‘Know that the <br/>
prayer of the sitter is only half as valuable as the prayer of the stander.’ <br/>
Thereupon the Muslims painfully struggled to their feet despite then <br/>
weakness and sickness, seeking a blessing. </p>
<p>Then the apostle prepared for war in pursuance of God’s command to <br/>
fight his enemies and to fight those polytheists who were near at hand <br/>
whom God commanded him to fight. This was thirteen years after his <br/>
call. </p>
<p>1 Cf. Ya&lt;|. iii. 8^4. 11, and Bukhari, i. 47U 13. Fakhkh is a place outside Mecca. Majanna <br/>
in the lower part of Mecca was a market of the Arabs in pa^an days. </p>
<p>2 Cf. Yaq. i. 35. j 6, who says it was once a large village with a pulpit on the road from’ <br/>
Medina to Mecca about four stages distant from the latter. It was the rendezvous of the <br/>
Egyptians and Syrians if they wished to avoid Medina. </p>
<p>The Life of d / a ham mad 2 81 </p>
<p>THE DATE OE THE HIJRA </p>
<p>By the preceding isnad from 'Abdullah b. Iiisham who said Ziyad b. <br/>
'Abdullah al-Bakka’I from Muhammad b. Ishaq told me that the apostle <br/>
came to Medina on Monday at high noon on the 12th of Rabi'u’l-awwal. </p>
<p>The apostle on that day was fifty-three years of age, that being thirteen <br/>
years after God called him. He stayed there for the rest of Rabi'u’l-awwal, <br/>
the month of Rabl'u’l-Akhir, the two Jumadas, Rajab, Sha'ban, Ramadan, <br/>
Shawwal, Dhu’l-Qa'da, Dhu’l -Hijja (when the polytheists supervised the <br/>
pilgrimage), and Muharram. Then he went forth raiding in Safar at the <br/>
beginning of the twelfth month from his coming to Medina (337). </p>
<p>(THE RAID ON WADDAN WHICH WAS HIS FIRST RAID) </p>
<p>until he reached Waddan, which is the raid of al-Abwa’, making for Quravsh <br/>
and B. Damra b. Bakr b. 'Abdu Manat b. Kinana. The B. Damra there 41 <br/>
made peace with him through their leader MakhshI b. 'Amr al-Damrl. <br/>
Then he returned to Medina without meeting war and remained there lor <br/>
the rest of Safar and the beginning of Rabi'u’l-awwal (338). </p>
<p>THE EXPEDITION OF 'iJBAYDA B. AL-IIARTTH </p>
<p>During that stay in Medina the apostle sent X'bayda b. al-Jlarith b. al- <br/>
Muttalib with sixty or eighty riders from the emigrants, there not being a <br/>
single one of the Ansar among them. He went as far as- water in the Hijaz <br/>
below Thanlyatu’l-Murra, where he encountered a large number of <br/>
Quravsh. No fighting took place except that Sa'd b. Abu Waqqas shot an <br/>
arrow on that day. It was the first arrow to he shot in Islam. Then the two <br/>
companies separated, the Muslims having a rearguard. Al-Miqdad b. <br/>
'Amr al-Bahrani, an ally of the B. Zuhra, and 'Utba b. Gha/,wan b. Jabir <br/>
al-Mazini, an ally of the B. Naufal b. 'Abdu Manat’, fied from the poly¬ <br/>
theists and joined the Muslims to whom they really belonged. They had <br/>
gone out with the unbelievers in order to be able to link up with the Mus¬ <br/>
lims. 'Ikrima h. Abu Jahl was in command of the Meccans (339). <br/>
Concerning this raid Abu Bakr composed the following (340). </p>
<p>Could you not sleep because of the spectre of Salma in the sandy <br/>
valleys, </p>
<p>And the important event that happened in the tribe? </p>
<p>You see that neither admonition nor a prophet’s call <br/>
Can save some of Lu’avy from unbelief; </p>
<p>A truthful prophet came to them and they gave him the lie, 4 1 </p>
<p>And said, ‘You shall not live among us.’ </p>
<p>When we called them to the truth they turned their backs, </p>
<p>They howled like bitches driven back panting to their lairs; </p>
<p>282 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>With how many of them have we ties of kinship. </p>
<p>Yet to abandon piety did not weigh upon them; </p>
<p>If they turn back from their unbelief and disobedience <br/>
(For the good and lawful is not like the abominable); </p>
<p>If they follow' their idolatry and error <br/>
God’s punishment on them will not tarry; </p>
<p>We are men of Ghalib’s highest stock <br/>
From which nobility comes through many branches; </p>
<p>I swear by the lord of camels urged on at even by singing, </p>
<p>Their feet protected by old leather thongs, </p>
<p>Like the red-backed deer that haunt Mecca <br/>
Going down to the well’s slimy cistern; </p>
<p>I sw'ear, and I am no perjurer, </p>
<p>If they do not quickly repent of their error, </p>
<p>A valiant band will descend upon them, </p>
<p>Which will leave women husbandless. </p>
<p>It will leave dead men, with vultures wheeling round, </p>
<p>It will not spare the infidels as Ibn Harith did. 1 <br/>
Give the Banu Sahm with you a message <br/>
And every infidel who is trying to do evil; </p>
<p>If you assaiF my honour in your evil opinion <br/>
I will not assaiF yours. </p>
<p>‘Abdullah b. al-Ziba'ra al-Sahml replied thus: </p>
<p>Does your eye weep unceasingly </p>
<p>Over the ruins of a dwelling that the shifting sand obscures? </p>
<p>And one of the wonders of the days <br/>
(For time is full of wonders, old and new) </p>
<p>Is a strong army which came to us <br/>
Led by 'Ubayda, called Ibn Harith in war, </p>
<p>That we should abandon images venerated in Mecca, </p>
<p>Passed on to his heirs by a noble ancestor. </p>
<p>When we met them with the spears of Rudayna, </p>
<p>And noble steeds panting for the fray, </p>
<p>And swords so white they might be salt-strewm <br/>
In the hands of w'arriors, dangerous as lions, </p>
<p>4x8 Wherewith eve deal with the conceited 3 </p>
<p>And quench our thirst for vengeance without delay, </p>
<p>They withdrew 7 in great fear and aw : e, </p>
<p>Pleased wfith the order of him w-ho kept them back. </p>
<p>Ilad they not done so the women would have wailed, </p>
<p>1 i.c. 'Ubayda. </p>
<p>2 Abu Dharr refers the meaning of this word to the divine omniscience. In this line <br/>
possibly ‘ancestry’ rather than ‘honour’ is the meaning of ' ird. </p>
<p>} Lit., the turning away of him who turns to one side. Possibly the writer has in mind <br/>
Sura 31. 17, ‘Turn not thy cheek in scorn towards people’. </p>
<p>2S3 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Bereft of their husbands all of them. </p>
<p>The slain would have been left for those concerned <br/>
And those utterly heedless to talk about. </p>
<p>Give Abu Bakr with you a message: </p>
<p>You have no further part in the honour 1 of Fihr, </p>
<p>No binding oath that cannot be broken <br/>
That w r ar will be renewed is needed from me (341). </p>
<p>Sa r d b. Abu Waqqas, according to reports, said about his having shot an <br/>
arrow 7 : </p>
<p>Has the news reached the apostle of God </p>
<p>That I protected my companions with my arrows? </p>
<p>By them I defended their vanguard <br/>
In rough ground and plain. </p>
<p>No archer who shoots an arrow at the enemy <br/>
Will be counted before me, O apostle of God. </p>
<p>’Twits because thy religion is true </p>
<p>Thou hast brought what is just and truthful. </p>
<p>By it the believers are saved </p>
<p>And unbelievers recompensed at the last. </p>
<p>Stop, thou hast gone astray, so do not slander me. </p>
<p>Woe to thee Abu Jahl, lost one ot the tribe! (342). </p>
<p>The flag of ‘Ubayda b. al-Harith according to my information was the <br/>
first flag which the apostle entrusted to a believer in Islam. Some scholars <br/>
allege that the apostle sent him when he came back from the raid of al- <br/>
Abwa’ before he got to Medina. </p>
<p>hamza’s expedition to the sea-siiore 419 </p>
<p>While he w r as staying there he sent Hamza bt 'Abdu’l-Muttalib to the sea¬ <br/>
shore in the neighbourhood of Al-'Is (T. in the territory of Juhayna) with <br/>
thirty riders from the emigrants; none of the helpers took part. He met <br/>
Abu Jahl with three hundred riders from Mecca on the shore, and Majdl <br/>
b. 'Amr al-Juhani intervened between them, for he was at peace with both <br/>
parties. So the people separated one from another without fighting. </p>
<p>Some people say that Hamza's flag was the first which the apostle gave <br/>
to any Muslim because he sent him and 'Ubayda at the same time, and <br/>
thus people became confused on the point. They alleged that Hamza had <br/>
composed poetry in which he says that his flag was the first which the <br/>
apostle entrusted to anyone. Now' if Hamza actually said that, it is true if <br/>
God wills. lie would not have said it if it were not true, but God knows <br/>
what happened. We have heard from learned people that 'Ubayda was the <br/>
first man to receive a flag. Hamza said concerning that, so they allege (343): <br/>
Wonder, O my people, at good sense and at folly, </p>
<p>At lack of sound counsel and at sensible advice, </p>
<p>1 See n. 2 on the previous page. </p>
<p>284 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>At those who have wronged us, while we have left <br/>
Their people and their property inviolate, </p>
<p>As though we had attacked them; </p>
<p>But all we did was to enjoin chastity and justice <br/>
And call them to Islam, but they received it not, </p>
<p>And they treated it as a joke. </p>
<p>They ceased not so until I volunteered to attack them <br/>
Where they dwelt, desiring the satisfaction of a task well done <br/>
At the apostle’s command—the first to march beneath his flag, <br/>
Seen with none before me, </p>
<p>A victorious flag from a generous, mighty God, </p>
<p>Whose acts are the most gracious. </p>
<p>At even they sallied forth together, </p>
<p>Each man’s pot burning with his companion’s rage; </p>
<p>When we saw each other, they halted and hobbled the camels, <br/>
And we did the same an arrow-shot distant. </p>
<p>We said to them, ‘God’s rope is our victorious defence, </p>
<p>You have no rope but error.’ </p>
<p>Abu Jahl warred there unjustly, </p>
<p>And was disappointed, for God frustrated his schemes. </p>
<p>W e were but thirty riders, while they were two hundred and one. <br/>
Therefore, O Lu’ayy, obey not your deceivers, </p>
<p>Return to Islam and the easy path, </p>
<p>For I fear that punishment will be poured upon you <br/>
And you will cry out in remorse and sorrow. </p>
<p>Abu Jahl answered him, saying: </p>
<p>I am amazed at the causes of anger and folly <br/>
And at those who stir up strife by lying controversy, </p>
<p>Who abandon our fathers’ ways. </p>
<p>Those noble, powerful men, </p>
<p>They come to us with lies to confuse our minds, </p>
<p>But their lies cannot confuse the intelligent. </p>
<p>We said to them, ‘O our people, strive not with your folk— <br/>
Controversy is the utmost folly— </p>
<p>For if you do, your weeping women will cry out <br/>
Wailing in calamity and bereavement. </p>
<p>If you give up what you are doing, </p>
<p>We are your cousins, trustworthy and virtuous.’ </p>
<p>They said to us, ‘We find Muhammad </p>
<p>One whom our cultured and intelligent accept.’ </p>
<p>W hen they were obstinately contentious <br/>
And all their deeds were evil, </p>
<p>I attacked them by the sea-shore, to leave them <br/>
Like a withered leaf on a rootless stalk. </p>
<p>285 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Majdl held me and my companions back from them <br/>
And they helped me with swords and arrows <br/>
Because of an oath binding on us, which we cannot discard, </p>
<p>A firm tie which cannot be severed. </p>
<p>But for Ibn 'Amr I should have left some of them <br/>
Food for the ever-present vultures, unavenged: </p>
<p>But he had sworn an oath, which made <br/>
Our hands recoil from our swords. </p>
<p>II time spares me I will come at them again, </p>
<p>With keen, new polished swords, </p>
<p>In the hands of warriors from Lu’ayy, son of Ghalib, </p>
<p>Generous in times of dearth and want (344). 1 </p>
<p>THE RAID ON BUWAT </p>
<p>Then the apostle went raiding in the month of Rabfu’I-Awwal making for <br/>
Quraysh (345), until he reached Buwat in the neighbourhood of Radwa. <br/>
Then he returned to Medina without fighting, and remained there for the <br/>
rest of Rabi'u’l-Akhir and part of Jumada’l-llla. </p>
<p>THE RAID ON AL-WjSIIAYRA </p>
<p>Then he raided the Quraysh (346). He went by the way of B. Dinar, then <br/>
by Fayfa’u-l-Khabar, and halted under a tree in the valley of Ibn Azhar <br/>
called Dhatu’l-Saq. There he prayed and there is his mosque. Food was <br/>
prepared and they all ate there. The place occupied by the stones which <br/>
supported his cooking-pot is still known. He drank from a watering place <br/>
called al-Mushtarib. 2 Then he went on leaving al-Khala’iq 3 on the left <br/>
and went through a glen called 'Abdullah to this day; then he bore to the <br/>
left 4 until he came down to Yalyal and halted where it joins al-Dabu'a. <br/>
He drank of the well at al-Dabu'a and then traversed the plain of Malal <br/>
until he met the tiack in Sukhayrat al-A amam which curried him straight <br/>
to al-'Ushayra in the valley of Yanbu' where he stopped during Jumada’l- <br/>
Ola and some days of the following month. He made a treaty of friend¬ <br/>
ship there with B. Mudlij and their allies B. Damra, and then returned to <br/>
Medina without a fight. It was on this raid that he spoke the well-known <br/>
words to 'Ah. </p>
<p>Yazid b. Muhammad b. Khaytham al-Muharibt from Muhammad b. <br/>
Ka'b. al-Qurazi from Muhammad b. Khaytham the father of Yazid from <br/>
Ammar b. Ausn told me that the latter said: All and I were close com¬ <br/>
panions in the raid of al-'Lshayra and when the apostle halted there we saw </p>
<p>1 The language of this ‘poem’ and its predecessor owes much to the Quran. </p>
<p>i Tab. and Suhayli have hil-Mushavrib. </p>
<p>3 According to Yaqiit there is a place of this name near Medina which belonged to <br/>
Abdullah b. Ahmad b, Jahsh. </p>
<p>4 Reading yasdr for W.’s Sad. Cf. Suhayli in lot:. </p>
<p>286 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>some men of B. Mudlij working at a well and on the date palms. ‘All <br/>
suggested' that we should go and see what the men were doing, so we went <br/>
and watched them for a time until we were overcome by drowsiness and <br/>
we went and lay down under some young palms and fell fast asleep in the <br/>
soft fine dust. And then who should wake us but the apostle himself as he <br/>
stirred us with his foot! It was as we were dusting ourselves that the apostle <br/>
said to r Ali when he saw him covered with dust, ‘What have you been up <br/>
to, Abu Turab (father of dust)?’ Then he went on, ‘Shall I tell you of the <br/>
two most wretched creatures? Uhaymir of Thamud who slaughtered the <br/>
camel, and he who shall strike you here, 'All’—and he put his hand to the <br/>
side of his head—‘until this is soaked from it’—and he took hold of his <br/>
beard. </p>
<p>A learned traditionist told me that the real reason why the apostle called <br/>
‘Ali Abu Turab was that when 'All’ was angry with Fatima he would not <br/>
speak to her. He did not say anything to annoy her, but he used to sprinkle <br/>
dust on his head. Whenever the apostle saw dust on 'All’s head he knew' <br/>
that he was angry with Fatima and he would say, ‘What is your trouble, 0 <br/>
Abu Turab?’ But God knows the truth of the matter. </p>
<p>THE RAID OF Sa'd B. ABU WAQQAS </p>
<p>Meanwhile the apostle had sent Sa'd b. Abu Waqqas with eight men from <br/>
the emigrants. He went as far as al-Kharrar in the Hijaz. Then he returned <br/>
424 without fighting (347). </p>
<p>THE RAID ON SAFAWAN, WHICH IS T 1 IE FIRST RAID OF BADR </p>
<p>The apostle stayed only a few nights, less than ten, in Medina when he <br/>
came back from raiding Al-'Ushayra, and then Kurz b. Jabir al-Fihrl <br/>
raided the pasturing camels of Medina. The apostle went out in search of <br/>
him (348), until he reached a valley called Safawan, in the neighbourhood <br/>
of Badr. Kurz escaped him and he could not overtake him. This was the <br/>
first raid of Badr. Then the apostle returned to Medina and*stayed there <br/>
for the rest of Jumada’l Akhira, Rajab, and Sha'ban. </p>
<p>EXPEDITION OF ‘ABDULLAH B. JAIISII AND THE <br/>
COMING DOWN OF ‘THEY WILL ASK YOU ABOUT THE <br/>
SACRED MONTH’ </p>
<p>The apostle sent 'Abdullah b. Jahsh b. Ri’iib al-Asadi in Rajab on his <br/>
return from the first Badr. He sent with him eight emigrants, without any <br/>
of the Ansar. He wrote for him a letter, and ordered him not to look at it </p>
<p>1 In IE (1271 ult.) the suggestion is made to 'AH by 'Ammar. Someone has been guilty <br/>
of a deliberate alteration. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 287 </p>
<p>until he had journeyed for two days, and to do what he was ordered to do, <br/>
but not to put pressure on any of his companions. The names of the eight <br/>
emigrants were, Abu Hudhayfa, 'Abdullah b. Jahsh, TJkkasha b. Mihsan, <br/>
'Utba b. Ghazwan, Sa'd b. Abu Waqqas, 'Amir b. Rabl'a, Waqid b. 424 <br/>
'Abdullah, and Khalid b. al-Bukayr. 1 </p>
<p>When 'Abdullah had travelled for two days he opened the letter and <br/>
looked into it, and this is what it said: ‘When you have read this letter of <br/>
mine proceed until you reach Nakhla between Mecca and Al-Ta’if. Lie in <br/>
wait there for Quraysh and fund out for us what they are doing.’ Having <br/>
read the letter he said, Fo hear is to obey.’ I hen he said to his com¬ <br/>
panions, ‘The apostle has commanded me to go to Nakhla to lie in wait <br/>
there for Quraysh so as to bring him news of them. He has forbidden me <br/>
to put pressure on any of you, so if anyone wishes for martyrdom let him <br/>
go forward, and he who does not, let him go back ; as for me I am going on <br/>
as the prophet has ordered.’ So he went on, as did all his companions, not <br/>
one of them falling back. He journeyed along the Hijaz until at a mine <br/>
called Bahran above al-Furu', Sa'd and 'Utba lost the camel which they <br/>
were riding by turns, so they stayed behind to look for it,'while 'Abdullah <br/>
and the rest of them went on to Nakhla. A caravan of Quraysh carrying <br/>
dry raisins and leather and other merchandise of Quraysh passed by them, </p>
<p>Amr b. al-Hadrami (349), Uthman b. Abdullah b. al-Mughira and his <br/>
brother Naufal the Makhzumites, and al-Hakam b. Kaysan, freedman <br/>
of Hisham b. al-Mughira being among them. When the caravan saw them <br/>
they were afraid of them because they had camped near them. 'Ukkasha, <br/>
who had shaved his head, looked down on them, and when they saw him <br/>
they felt safe and said, ‘They are pilgrims, you have nothing to fear from <br/>
them.’ The raiders took council among themselves, for this was the last <br/>
day of Rajab, and they said, ‘If you leave them alone tonight they will get <br/>
into the sacred area and will be safe from you; and if you kill them, you 4 2 5 <br/>
will kill them in the sacred month,’ so they were hesitant and feared to <br/>
attack them. Then they encouraged each other, and decided to kill as <br/>
many as they could of them and take what they had. Waqid shot 'Amr b. <br/>
al-Hadrami with an arrow and killed him, and 'Uthman and al-Hakam <br/>
surrendered. Naufal escaped and eluded them. 'Abdullah and his com¬ <br/>
panions took the caravan and the two prisoners and came to Medina with <br/>
them. One of 'Abdullah’s family mentioned that he said to his companions, </p>
<p>‘A fifth of what we have taken belongs to the apostle.’ (This was before <br/>
God had appointed a fifth of the booty to him.) So he set apart for the <br/>
apostle a fifth of the caravan, and divided the rest among his companions. </p>
<p>When they came to the apostle, he said, T did not order you to fight in <br/>
the sacred month,’ and he held the caravan and the two prisoners in sus¬ <br/>
pense and refused to take anything from them. When the apostle said that, <br/>
the men were in despair and thought that they were doomed. Their Mus- </p>
<p>1 As these men have already been named with full particulars of their genealogy and <br/>
tribes, only their first names are repeated here. </p>
<p>288 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>lim brethren reproached them for what they had done, and the Quraysh <br/>
said ‘Muhammad and his companions have violated the sacred month, <br/>
shed blood therein, taken booty, and captured men.’ The Muslims in <br/>
Mecca who opposed them said that they had done it in Sha'ban. The <br/>
Jews turned this raid into an omen against the apostle. 'Ann* b. al-Hadrami <br/>
whom Waqid had killed they said meant ' amarati’l-harb (war has come to <br/>
life), al-Hadrami meant had aratL l-harb (war is present), and Waqid meant <br/>
icaqadati l-harb (war is kindled); but God turned this against them, not <br/>
for them, and when there was much talk about it, God sent down to his <br/>
apostle: ‘They will ask you about the sacred month, and war in it. Say, <br/>
war therein is a serious matter, but keeping people from the way of God <br/>
and disbelieving in Him and in the sacred mosque and driving out His <br/>
people therefrom is more serious with God.’ 1 i.e. If you have killed in the <br/>
sacred month, they have kept you back from the way of God with their <br/>
unbelief in Him, and from the sacred mosque, and have driven you from <br/>
it when vou were its people. This is a more serious matter with God than </p>
<p>426 the killing of those of them whom you have slain. ‘And seduction is <br/>
worse than killing.’ i.e. They used to seduce the Muslim in his religion <br/>
until they made him return to unbelief after believing, and that is worse <br/>
with God than killing. ‘And they will not cease to fight you until they <br/>
turn you back from your religion if they can.’ i.e. They are doing more <br/>
heinous acts than that contumaciously. </p>
<p>And when the Quran came down about that and God relieved the Mus¬ <br/>
lims of their anxiety in the matter, the apostle took the caravan and the <br/>
prisoners. Quraysh sent to him to redeem 'Uthman and al-Hakam, and <br/>
the apostle said, ‘We will not let you redeem them until our two com¬ <br/>
panions come,’ meaning Sa'd and 'Utba, ‘for we fear for them on your <br/>
account. If you kill them, we will kill your two friends.’ So when Sa'd and <br/>
'Utba turned up the apostle let them redeem them. As for al-Hakam he <br/>
became a good Muslim and stayed with the apostle until he was killed as <br/>
a martyr at Bi’r Ma'una. 'Uthman went back to Mecca and died there as <br/>
an unbeliever. When 'Abdullah and his companions were relieved of their <br/>
anxiety when the Quran came down, they were anxious for reward, and <br/>
said, ‘Can we hope that it will count as a raid for which we shall be given <br/>
the reward of combatants?’ So God sent down concerning them: ‘Those <br/>
who believe and have emigrated and fought in the way of God, these may <br/>
hope for God’s mercy, for God is forgiving, merciful.’ That is, God gave <br/>
them the greatest hopes therein. The tradition about this comes from Al- <br/>
Zuhrl and Yazld b. Human from 'Urwa b. al-Zubayr. </p>
<p>One of 'Abdullah’s family mentioned that God divided the booty when <br/>
He made it permissible and gave four-fifths to whom God had allowed to <br/>
take it and one-fifth to God and His apostle. So it remained on the basis <br/>
of what 'Abdullah had done with the booty of that caravan (350). </p>
<p>427 Abu Bakr said concerning 'Abdullah’s raid (though others say that 'Ab- </p>
<p>1 Sura 2. 214. </p>
<p>7 he Life of Muhammad 289 </p>
<p>dullah himself said it), when Quraysh said, ‘Muhammad and his com¬ <br/>
panions have broken the sacred month, shed blood therein, and taken <br/>
booty and made prisoners’ (351): </p>
<p>\ou count war in the holy month a grave matter, </p>
<p>But graver is, if one judges rightly, </p>
<p>Your opposition to Muhammad’s teaching, and your <br/>
Unbelief in it, which God sees and witnesses, </p>
<p>^our driving God’s people from His mosque <br/>
So that none can be seen worshipping Him there. </p>
<p>Though you defame us for killing him, </p>
<p>More dangerous to Islam is the sinner who envies. </p>

<p>THE CHANGE OF THE Q 1 HLA TO THE' Ka'bA </p>
<p>It is said that the Qibla was changed in Sha'ban at the beginning of the <br/>
eighteenth month after the apostle’s arrival in Medina. </p>
<p>i,o 1 1 A ^ 1 &gt; </p>
<p>Then the apostle heard that Abu Sufyan b. Harb was coming from Svria <br/>
with a large caravan of Quraysh, containing their money and merchandise, <br/>
accompanied by some thirty or forty men, of whom were Makhrama b. </p>
<p>Naufal b. Uhayb b. ‘Abdu Manaf b. Zuhra, and 'Amr b. al-'As b. Wa’il b <br/>
Hisham (352). </p>
<p>( Muhammad b. Muslim al-Zuhri and 'Asim b. 'Umar b Qatada and <br/>
Abdullah b. Abu Bakr and Ya/.Td b. Human from 'Urwa b. al-Zubavr, and <br/>
other scholars of ours from Ibn 'Abbas, each one of them told me some of <br/>
this story and their account is collected in what I have drawn up of the <br/>
story of Badr. They said that when the apostle heard about Abu Sufvan <br/>
commg from Syria, he summoned the Muslims and said, “Phis is the <br/>
Quraysh caravan containing their property. Go out to attack it, perhaps <br/>
j od will give it as a prey.’ The people answered his summons, some <br/>
eagerly, others reluctantly because they had not thought that the apostle <br/>
wouU go to war. When he got near to the Ilijaz, Abu Sufvan was seeking <br/>
news, and questioning every rider in his anxiety, until he'got news from <br/>
some rulers that Muhammad had called out his companions against him <br/>
and Us caravan. He took alarm at that and hired Damdam b. 'Amr al- <br/>
Ghifari and sent him to Mecca, ordering him to call out Quraysh in defence <br/>
of their property, and to tell them that Muhammad was lying in wait for <br/>
it with his companions. So Damdam left for Mecca at full speed. </p>
<p>1 Cf. Sura 2. 214 f. which these lines endeavour to put into verse <br/>

<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>the dream of 'atika d. of 'abdu l-mutialib </p>
<p>A person above suspicion told me on the authority of 'Iknma from b. <br/>
'Abbas and Yazld b. Ruman from ‘Urwa b. al-Zubayr, saying: ‘three days <br/>
before Damdam arrived 'Atika saw a vision which frightened her. She sent <br/>
to her brother aI-‘Abbas saying, “Brother, last night I saw a vision which <br/>
frightened me and I am afraid that evil and misfortune will come upon <br/>
your people, so treat what I tell you as a confidence.” lie asked wlvat she <br/>
had seen, and she said, “I saw a rider coming upon a camel who halted m <br/>
the valley. Then he cried at the top of his voice, ‘Come forth, O people, <br/>
do not leave your men to face a disaster that will come in three days time. </p>
<p>I saw the people flock to him, and then he went into the mosque with the <br/>
people following him. While they were round him his camel mounted to <br/>
the top of the Ka'ba. Then he called out again, using the same words. </p>
<p>429 Then his camel mounted to the top of Abu Qubays, 1 2 and he cried out <br/>
again. Then he seized a rock and loosened it, and it began to fall, until at <br/>
the bottom of the mountain it split into pieces. There was not a house or <br/>
a dwelling in Mecca but received a bit of it.” al-'Abbas said. By God, this <br/>
is indeed^ a vision, and you had better keep quiet about it and not tell <br/>
anvone.” Then 'Abbas went out and met al-Walld b. 'Utba, who was a <br/>
friend of his, and told him and asked him to keep it to himself. al-YVa id <br/>
told his father and the story spread in Mecca until Quraysh were talking </p>
<p>about it in their public meetings. . T ,ki </p>
<p>‘al-'Abbas said, “I got up early to go round the temple, while Abu Jahl <br/>
was sitting with a number of Quraysh talking about ‘Atika s vision. W hen <br/>
he saw me he said, ‘Come to us when you have finished going round the <br/>
temple.’ When I had finished I went and sat with them, and he said, U <br/>
Banu 'Abdu’I-Muttalib, since when have you had a prophetess among you r <br/>
‘And what do you mean by that ?’ I said. ‘That vision which 'Atika saw, he <br/>
answered. I said, ‘And what did she see?’ He said, ‘Are you not satisfie <br/>
that your men should play the prophet that your women should do so also. <br/>
'Atika has alleged that in her vision someone said, “Come forth to war m <br/>
three days.” We shall keep an eye on you these three days, and if what s ae <br/>
says is true, then it will be so; but if the three days pass and nothing hap¬ <br/>
pens, we will write you down as the greatest liars of the temple peop e <br/>
among the Arabs.’ Nothing much had passed between us except that X <br/>
contradicted that and denied that she had seen anything. on we sepa <br/>
rated. When night came every single woman of B. ‘Abdu 1 -Muttahb came <br/>
to me and said, ‘Have you allowed this evil rascal to attack your men and <br/>
then go on to insult your women while you listened? Have you no shame <br/>
that you should listen to such things ?’ I said, ‘By God I have done some¬ <br/>
thing; nothing much passed between us but I swear by God that I will <br/>
confront him, and if he repeats what he has said, I will rid you of him. </p>

<p>2 A mountain hard by. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 291 </p>
<p>On the third day after ‘Atika’s vision, while I was enraged, thinking that <br/>
I had let something slip which I wanted to get from him, I went into the 430 <br/>
mosque and saw him, and as I was walking towards him to confront him <br/>
so that he should repeat some of what he had said and I could attack him, <br/>
for he was a thin man with sharp features, sharp tongue, and sharp sight, <br/>
lo, he came out towards the door of the mosque hurriedly, and I said to <br/>
myself, ‘What is the matter with him, curse him, is all this for fear that I <br/>
should insult him?’ But lo, he had heard something which I did not hear, <br/>
the voice of Damdam crying out in the bottom of the wadi, as he stood <br/>
upon his camel, having cut its nose, turned its saddle round, and rent his <br/>
shirt, while he was saying, ‘O Quraysh, the transport camels, the transport <br/>
camels! Muhammad and his companions are lying in wait for your pro¬ <br/>
perty which is with Abu Sufyan. I do not think that you will overtake it. <br/>
Help! Help!’ This diverted him and me from our affair.” </p>
<p>QURAYSH PREPARE TO GO TO BADR </p>
<p>The men prepared quickly, saying, “Do Muhammad and his companions <br/>
think this is going to be like the caravan of Ibn Hadrami? By God, they <br/>
will soon know that it is not so.” Every man of them either went himself or <br/>
sent someone in his place. So all went; not one of their nobles remained <br/>
behind except Abu Lahab. fie sent in his place al-'As b. Hisham b. al- <br/>
Mughira who owed him four thousand dirhams which he could not pay. </p>
<p>So he hired him with them on the condition that he should be cleared of his <br/>
debt. So he went on his behalf and Abu Lahab stayed behind.’ </p>
<p>‘Abdullah b. Abu Najlh told me that Umayya b. Khalaf had decided to <br/>
stay at home. He w r as a stately old man, corpulent and heavy. ‘Uqba b. </p>
<p>Abu Mu'ayt came to him as he was sitting in the mosque among his com¬ <br/>
panions, carrying a censer burning with scented wood. He put it in front <br/>
of him and said, ‘Scent yourself with that, for you belong to the women!’ </p>
<p>‘God curse you and what you have brought,’ he said, and then got ready <br/>
and went out with the rest. When they had finished their preparations <br/>
and decided to start, they remembered the quarrel there was between them <br/>
and B. Bakr b. ‘Abdu Manat b. Kinana, and were afraid that they would <br/>
attack them in the rear. </p>
<p>The cause of the war between Quraysh and B. Bakr, according to what 431 <br/>
one of B. ‘Amir b. Lu’ayy from Muhammad b. Sa'Id b. al-Musayyab told <br/>
me, was a son of Hafs b. al-Akhyaf, one of the B. Ma'Is b. 'Amir b. Lu’ayy. </p>
<p>He had gone out seeking a lost camel of his in Dajnan, He was a youngster <br/>
with flowing locks on his head, wearing a robe, a good-looking, clean youth. </p>
<p>He passed by 'Amir b. Yazld b. 'Amir b. al-Mulawwih, one of B. Ya'mar b. </p>
<p>'Auf b. Ka'b b. ‘Amir b. Layth b. Bakr b. ‘Abdu Manat b, Kinana in <br/>
Pajnan, he being the chief of B. Bakr at that time. When he saw' him he <br/>
liked him and asked him who he was. When he told him, and had gone <br/>
away, he called his tribesmen, and asked them if there was any blood </p>
<p>2 Q2 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>outstanding with Quraysh, and when theysaid there was, he said,‘Any man <br/>
who kills this youngster in revenge for one of his tribe will have exacted <br/>
the blood due to him.’ So one of them followed him and killed him m <br/>
revenge for the blood Quraysh had shed. When Quraysh discussed the <br/>
matter, 'Amir b. Yazld said, ‘You owed us blood so what do you want ? If <br/>
you wish pay us what you owe us, and we will pay you what we owe. If, <br/>
you want only blood, man for man, then ignore your claims and we will <br/>
ignore ours’; and since this youth was of no great importance to this clan <br/>
of Quraysh, they said, ‘All right, man for man’, and ignored his death and <br/>
sought no compensation for it. </p>
<p>Now while his brother Mikraz was travelling in Marr al-Zahran he saw <br/>
'Amir on a camel, and as soon as he saw ? him 'Amir went up to him and made <br/>
his camel kneel beside him. "'Amir was wearing a sword, and Mikraz brought <br/>
his sword down on him and killed him. Then he twirled his sword about in <br/>
his belly, and brought it back to Mecca and hung it overnight among the <br/>
curtains of the Ka'ba. When morning came Quraysh saw 'Amir’s sword <br/>
hanging among the curtains of the Ka'ba and recognized it. They said, <br/>
43 2 ‘This is 'Amir’s sword; Mikraz has attacked and killed him.’ This is what <br/>
happened, and while this vendetta was going on, Islam intervened between <br/>
men, and they occupied themselves with that, until when Quraysh decided <br/>
to go to Badr they remembered the vendetta with B. Bakr and were afraid </p>
<p>of them. </p>
<p>Mikraz b. Hafs said about his killing 'Amir: </p>
<p>When I saw that it was 'Amir I remembered the fleshless corpse of my <br/>
dear brother. </p>
<p>I said to myself, it is 'Amir, fear not my soul and look to what you do. </p>
<p>I was certain that as soon as I got in a shrewd blow with the sword, it <br/>
would be the end of him. </p>
<p>I swooped down on him, on a brave, experienced man, with a sharp </p>
<p>sword. . </p>
<p>When we came to grips I did not show myself a son of ignob e </p>
<p>parents, </p>
<p>I slaked my vengeance, forgetting not revenge which only weaklings <br/>
forgo (353). </p>
<p>Yazld b. Ruman from 'Urwa b. al-Zubayr told me that when Quraysh <br/>
were ready to set off they remembered their quarrel with B. Bakr and it <br/>
almost deterred them from starting. However, Iblls appeared to them in <br/>
the form of Suraqa b. Malik b. Ju'tham al-Mudliji who was one of the <br/>
chiefs of B. Kinana saying, ‘I will guarantee that Kinana will not attack <br/>
you in the rear,’ so they went off speedily. </p>
<p>The apostle set out in the month of Ramadan (354). He gave the flag to <br/>
433 Mus'ab b. 'Umayr b. Hashim b. 'Abdu Manaf b. 'Abdu’l-Dar (355). The <br/>
apostle was preceded by two black flags, one with 'All called al- Uqab and <br/>
the other with one of the Ansar. His companions had seventy camels on </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 293 </p>
<p>which men rode in turns: the apostle with 'All and Marthad b. Abu Mar- <br/>
thad al-Ghanawi one camel; Hamza and Zayd b. Haritha and Abu Kabsha <br/>
and Anasa freedmen of the apostle one camel; and Abu Bakr, and 'Umar, <br/>
and 'Abdu’I-Rahman b. 'Auf one camel. The apostle put over the rear¬ <br/>
guard Qays b. Abu Sa'sa'a brother of B. Mazin b. al-Najjar (356). </p>
<p>He took the road to Mecca by the upper route from Medina, then by al- <br/>
'Aqlq, Dhu’l-Hulayfa, and Olatu’l-Jaysh (357). Then he passed '[’urban, <br/>
Malal, Ghamisu’I-Hamam, Sukhayratu’l-Yamam, and Sayala; then by the <br/>
ravine of al-Rauha’ to Shaniika, which is the direct route, until at 'Irqu’l- <br/>
Zabya (35S) be met a nomad. He asked him about the Quraysh party, but <br/>
found that he had no news. The people said, ‘Salute God’s apostle.’ He <br/>
said, ‘Have you got God’s apostle with you V and when they said that they <br/>
had, he said, ‘If you are God’s apostle, then tell me what is in the belly of <br/>
my she-camel here.’ Salama b. Salama said to him, ‘Don’t question God’s <br/>
apostle; but come to me and I will tell you about it. You leapt upon her <br/>
and she has in her belly a little goat from you!’ The apostle said, ‘Enough! </p>
<p>You have spoken obscenely to the man.’ Then he turned away from <br/>
Salama. </p>
<p>The apostle stopped at Sajsaj which is the well of al-Rauha ; then went <br/>
on to al-Munsaraf, leaving the Meccan road on the left, and went to the <br/>
right to al-Naziya making for Badr. Arrived in its neighbourhood he 434 <br/>
crossed a wadi called Ruhqan between al-Naziya and the pass of al-Safra’; <br/>
then along the pass; then he debouched from it until when near al-Safra’ <br/>
he sent Basbas b. 'Amr al-Juhani, an ally of B. Sa'ida, and 'Adiv b. Abu <br/>
Zaghba’ al-Juhani, ally of B. al-Najjar, to Badr to scout for news about <br/>
Abu Sufvan and his caravan. 1 Having sent them on ahead he moved off <br/>
and when he got to al-Safra’, w'hich is a village between two mountains, he <br/>
asked what their names were. He was told that they were Muslih and <br/>
Mukhrik 2 He asked about their inhabitants and was told that they were <br/>
B. al-Nar and B. Huraq, 1 two clans ot B. Ghifar. The apostle drew an ill <br/>
omen from their names and so disliked them that he refused to pass be¬ <br/>
tween them, so he left them and al-Safra’ on his left and went to the right <br/>
to a wadi called Dhafiran which he crossed and then halted. </p>
<p>News came to him that Quraysh had set out to protect their caravan, <br/>
and he told the people of this and asked their advice. Abu Bakr and then <br/>
'Umar got up and spoke well. Then al-Miqdad got up and said, ‘O apostle <br/>
of God, go where God tells you for we are with you. We will not say as the <br/>
children of Israel said to Moses, “You and your Lord go and fight and wc <br/>
will stay at home,’’ 4 but you and your Lord go and fight, and we will fight </p>
<p>1 Though there is no authority in the printed editions, or in the variants cited therein, </p>
<p>I cannot help thinking that the reading should be 'irihi and not ejmyrihi, ‘anyone else’. In <br/>
the earlier raids the prophet had not made inquiries about all and sundry and all he was <br/>
concerned vvith was the Meccan caravan and the Meccan army. If the latter were meant in <br/>
the assumed reading - j’hayrihi, one feels they would have been explicitly mentioned. No!, <br/>
reads ‘'irihi T. 129c}’. 2 Both names mean ‘defecator’. </p>
<p>3 ‘.Fire’ and ‘Burning’ respectively. 4 Sura 5. 27. </p>
<p>294 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>with you. By God, if you were to take us to Bark al-Ghimad, 1 we would <br/>
fight resolutely with you against its defenders until you gained it.’ The <br/>
apostle thanked him and blessed him. Then he said, ‘Give me advice, O <br/>
Men,’ by which he meant the Ansar. This is because they formed the <br/>
majority, and because when they had paid homage to him in al-'Aqaba <br/>
they stipulated that they were not responsible for his safety until he entered <br/>
their territory, and that when he was there they would protect him as they <br/>
did their wives and children. So the apostle was afraid that the Ansar <br/>
would not feel obliged to help him unless he was attacked by an enemy in <br/>
Medina, and that they would not feel it incumbent upon them to go with </p>
<p>435 him against an enemy outside their territory. When he spoke these words <br/>
Sa'd b. Mu'adh said, ‘It seems as if you mean us,’ and when he said that <br/>
he did, Sa'd said, ‘We believe in you, we declare your truth, and we witness <br/>
that wdiat you have brought is the truth, and we have given you our word <br/>
and agreement to hear and obey; so go where you wish, we are with you; <br/>
and by God, if you were to ask us to cross this sea and you plunged into it, <br/>
we would plunge into it with you; not a man would stay behind. We do <br/>
not dislike the idea of meeting your enemy tomorrow'. We are experienced <br/>
in war, trustworthy in combat. It may w'ell be that God will let us show <br/>
you something W'hich will bring you joy, so take us along with God’s <br/>
blessing.’ The apostle was delighted at Sa'd’s words which greatly encou¬ <br/>
raged him. Then he said, ‘Forward in good heart, for God has promised <br/>
me one of the two parties, 2 and by God, it is as though I now saw the <br/>
enemy lying prostrate.’ Then the apostle journeyed from Dhafran and <br/>
w'ent over passes called Asafir. Then he dropped dowm from them to a <br/>
towm called al-Dabba and left al-Hannan on the right. This w'as a huge <br/>
sandhill like a large mountain. Then he stopped near Badr and he and <br/>
one of his companions (359) rode on, as Muhammad b. Yahya b. Habban <br/>
told me, until he stopped by an old man of the Beduin and inquired about <br/>
Quraysh and about Muhammad and his companions, and wdiat he had <br/>
heard about them. The old man said, ‘I w'on’t tell you until you tell me <br/>
which party you belong to.’ The apostle said, ‘If you tell us w r e w T ill tell <br/>
you.’ He said, ‘Tit for tat?’ ‘Yes,’ he replied. The old man said, ‘I have <br/>
heard that Muhammad and his companions went out on such-and-such a' <br/>
day. If that is true, today they are in such-and-such a place,’ referring to <br/>
the place in w'hich the apostle actually was, ‘and I heard that Quraysh <br/>
W'ent out on such-and-such a day, and if this is true, today they are in <br/>
such-and-such a place,’ meaning the one in W'hich they actually w'ere. <br/>
When he had finished he said, ‘Of wdiom are you ?’ The apostle said, ‘We <br/>
are from Ma’.’ 3 Then he left him, while the old man w r as saying, ‘What does </p>
<p>436 “from Ma”’ mean? Is it from the water of Iraq?’ (360). </p>
<p>1 A place in the Yemen, others say the farthest point of Hajar. q I 3 °° adds ‘a town of <br/>
the Abyssinians’. </p>
<p>2 i.e. the caravan or the army. Cf. Sura 8. 7 </p>
<p>3 i.e. Water. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 295 </p>
<p>Then the apostle returned to his companions; and when night fell he <br/>
sent ‘Ah and al-Zubayr b. al-'Awwam and Sa'd b. Abu Waqqas with a <br/>
number of his companions to the well at Badr in quest of new's of both <br/>
parties, according to wdiat Yazld b. Ruman from TJrwa b. al-Zubayr told <br/>
me, and they fell in with some water-camels of Quraysh, among whom <br/>
were Aslam, a slave of B. al-Hajjaj, and ‘Arid Abu Yasar, a young man of <br/>
B. Al-'As b. Sa'Id, and they brought them along and questioned them <br/>
while the apostle was standing praying. 'They said, ‘We are the watermen <br/>
of Quraysh; they sent us to get them water.’ The people w'ere displeased <br/>
at their report, for they had hoped that they would belong to Abu Sufyan, <br/>
so they beat them, and w r hen they had beaten them soundlv, the two men <br/>
said, ‘We belong to Abu Sufyan,’ so they let them go. The apostle bowed <br/>
and prostrated himself twice, and said, ‘When they told you the truth you <br/>
beat them; and w'hen they lied you let them alone. They told the truth; <br/>
they do belong to Quraysh. Tell me you two about the Quraysh.’ 1 They <br/>
replied, ‘They arc behind this hill which you see on the farthest side.’ <br/>
(The hill was al-'Aqanqal.) The apostle asked them how many they were, <br/>
and w'hen they said, ‘Many,’ he asked for the number, but they did not <br/>
know r ; so he asked them how many beasts they slaughtered every day, and <br/>
when they said nine or ten, he said, ‘The people are between nine hundred <br/>
and a thousand.’ Then he asked how' many nobles of Quraysh were <br/>
among them. They said: “Utba, Shayba, Abu’l-Bakhtari, Hakim, Xaufal, <br/>
al-Harith b. ‘Amir, Tu'ayma, al-Nadr, Zama'a, Abu Jald, Umayya, Nabih, <br/>
Munabbih, Suhayl, 'Amr b. 'Abdu Wudd.’ The apostle went to the people <br/>
and said, ‘This Mecca has thrown to you the pieces of its liver!’ 2 </p>
<p>Basbas and ‘Adiy had gone on until they reached Badr, and halted on a <br/>
hill near the water. Then they took an old skin to fetch water while Majdi <br/>
b. 'Amr al-Juhani was by the water. 'Adiy and Basbas heard two girls <br/>
from the village discussing a debt, and one said to the other, ‘The caravan 43 <br/>
will come tomorrow' or the day after and I will w'ork for them and then <br/>
pay you what I owe you.’ Majdi said, ‘You are right,’ and he made <br/>
arrangements with them. Adiy and Basbas overheard this, and rode off to <br/>
the apostle and told him wdiat they had overheard. </p>
<p>Abu Sufyan w'ent forward to get in front of the caravan as a precaution¬ <br/>
ary measure until he came dowm to the water, and asked Majdi if he had <br/>
noticed anything. He replied that he had seen nothing untoward: merelv <br/>
two riders had stopped on the hill and taken water away in a skin. Abu <br/>
Sufyan came to the spot where they had halted, picked up some camel <br/>
dung and broke it in pieces and found that it contained date-stones, ‘By <br/>
God,’ he said, ‘this is the fodder of Yathrib.’ He returned at once to his <br/>
companions and changed the caravan’s direction from the road to the sea¬ <br/>
shore leaving Badr on the left, travelling as quickly as possible. </p>
<p>Quraysh advanced and when they reached al-Juhfa Juhavm b. al-Salt b. <br/>
Makhrama b. al-Muttalib saw a vision. He said, ‘Between waking and </p>
<p>1 T- I 3°4&gt; 4. ‘where the Quraysh are’. 2 i.e. ‘its best men’. </p>
<p>296 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>sleeping I saw a man advancing on a horse with a camel, and then he <br/>
halted and said: “Slain are 'Utba and Shayba and Abu’I-Ilakam and <br/>
Umayya” (and he went on to enumerate the men who were killed at Badr, <br/>
all nobles of Quraysh). Then I saw him stab his camel in the chest and <br/>
send it loose into the camp, and every single tent was bespattered with its <br/>
blood.’ When the story reached Abu Jahl he said, ‘Here’s another prophet <br/>
from B. al-Muttalib! He’ll know tomorrow if we meet them who is going <br/>
to be killed!’ </p>
<p>When Abu Sufyan saw that he had saved his caravan he sent word to <br/>
Quraysh, ‘Since you came out to save your caravan, your men, and your </p>
<p>438 property, and God has delivered them, go back.’ Abu Jahl said, ‘By God, <br/>
we will not go back until we have been to Badr’—Badr was the site of one <br/>
of the Arab fairs where they used to hold a market every year. ‘We will <br/>
spend three days there, slaughter camels and feast and drink wane, and <br/>
the girls shall play for us. The Arabs will hear that we have come and <br/>
gathered together, and will respect us in future. So come on!’ </p>
<p>AI-Akhnas b. Sharlq b. 'Amr b. Wahb al-Thaqafl, an ally of B. Zuhra <br/>
who were in al-Juhfa, addressed the latter, saying, ‘God has saved you <br/>
and your property and delivered your companion Makhrama b. Naufal; <br/>
and as you only came out to protect him and his property, lay any <br/>
charge of cowardice on me and go back. There is no point in going to war <br/>
without profit as this man would have us,’ meaning Abu Jahl. So they <br/>
returned and not a single Zuhrite w r as present at Badr. They obeyed him <br/>
as he was a man of authority. Every clan of Quraysh was represented <br/>
except B. 'AdTv b. Ka'b: not one of them took part, so with the return of <br/>
B. Zuhra with al-Akhnas these two tribes were not represented at all. <br/>
There was some discussion between Talib b. Abu Talib, who was with the <br/>
army, ami some of Quraysh. The latter said, ‘We know, O B. flashim, <br/>
that if you have come out with us your heart is with Muhammad.’ So <br/>
Talib and some others returned to Mecca. Talib said: </p>
<p>O God, if Talib goes forth to war unwillingly <br/>
With one of these squadrons, </p>
<p>Let him be the plundered not the plunderer, </p>
<p>The vanquished not the victor (361). </p>
<p>439 Quraysh w'ent on until they halted on the farther side of the wadi <br/>
behind al-'Aqanqal. The bed of the wadi—Yalyal—w r as between Badr and <br/>
al-'Aqanqal, the hill behind which lay Quraysh, while the wells at Badr <br/>
were on the side of the wadi bed nearest to Medina. God sent a rain which <br/>
turned the soft sand of the wadi into a compact surface w'hich did not <br/>
hinder the apostle’s movements, but gravely restricted the movements of <br/>
Quraysh. The apostle went forth to hasten his men to the water and when <br/>
he got to the nearest water of Badr he halted. </p>
<p>I was told that men of B. Salama said that at-Hubab b. al-Mundhir b. <br/>
al-Jamuh said to the apostle: ‘Is this a place which God has ordered </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 297 </p>
<p>you to occupy, so that we can neither advance nor withdraw from it, <br/>
or is it a matter of opinion and military tactics?’ When he replied that <br/>
it was the latter he pointed out that it was not the place to stop but that <br/>
they should go on to the water nearest to the enemy and halt there, stop <br/>
up the wells beyond it, and construct a cistern so that they would have <br/>
plenty of water; then they could fight their enemy who would have nothing <br/>
to drink. The apostle agreed that this was an excellent plan and it was <br/>
immediately carried out; the wells were stopped; a cistern was built and <br/>
filled with water from which his men replenished their drinking-vessels. </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr told me that he was informed that Sa'd b. Mu'adh <br/>
said: ‘O prophet of God, let us make a booth (T. of palm-branches) for <br/>
you to occupy and have your riding camels standing by; then we will meet <br/>
the enemy and if God gives us the victory that is what we desire; if the 440 <br/>
worst occurs you can mount your camels and join our people who are left <br/>
behind, for they are just as deeply attached to you as we are. Had they <br/>
thought that you would be fighting they would not have stayed behind. </p>
<p>God will protect you by them; they will give you good counsel and fight <br/>
with you.’ The apostle thanked him and blessed him. Then a booth was <br/>
constructed for the apostle and he remained there. </p>
<p>Quraysh, having marched forth at daybreak, now came on. When the <br/>
apostle saw them descending from the hill 'Aqanqal into the valley, he <br/>
cried, ‘O God, here come the Quraysh in their vanity and pride, contending <br/>
with Thee and calling Thy apostle a liar. O God, grant the help which <br/>
Thou didst promise me. Destroy them this morning!’ Before uttering <br/>
these words he had seen among the enemy 'Utba b. Rabi'a, mounted on a <br/>
red camel of his, and said, ‘If there is any good in any one of them, it will <br/>
be with the man on the red camel: if they obey him, they will take the right <br/>
way.’ Khufaf b. Aima’ b. Rahada, or his father Aims’ b. Rahada al- <br/>
Ghifan, had sent to Quraysh, as they passed by, a son of his with some <br/>
camels for slaughter, which he gave them as a gift, saving, ‘If you want us <br/>
to support you with arms and men, we will do so;’ but they sent to him the <br/>
following message by the mouth of his son—‘You have done all that a <br/>
kinsman ought. If we are fighting only men, w ? e are surely equal to them; <br/>
and if we are fighting God, as Muhammad alleges, none is able to with¬ <br/>
stand Him.’ And when Quraysh encamped, some of them, among whom <br/>
was Hakim b. Hizam, went to the cistern of the apostle to drink. ‘Let them <br/>
be!’ he said; and every man that drank of it on that day was killed, except <br/>
Hakim, 1 who afterwards became a good Muslim and used to say, w hen he <br/>
was earnest in his oath, ‘Nay, by Him who saved me on the day of Badr.’ </p>
<p>My father, Ishaq b. Yasar, and other learned men told me on the autho- 441 <br/>
rity of some elders of the Ansar that when the enemy had settled in their <br/>
camp they sent TJmayr b. Wahb al-Jumahl to estimate the number of <br/>
Muhammad’s followers. He rode on horseback round the camp and on his <br/>
return said, ‘Three hundred men, a little more or less; but wait till 1 see <br/>
1 T. adds: ‘He escaped on a horse of his called al-Wajih. 1 So also al-Agh. </p>
<p>298 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>whether they have any in ambush or support.’ He made his way far into <br/>
the valley but saw nothing. On his return he said, ‘I found nothing, but O <br/>
people of Quraysh, I have seen camels carrying Death—the camels of <br/>
Yathrib laden with certain death. These men have no defence or refuge <br/>
but their swords. By God! I do not think that a man of them will be slain <br/>
till he slay one of you, and if they kill of you a number equal to their own, <br/>
what is the good of living after that ? Consider, then, what you will do.’ <br/>
When I laklm b. Hizam heard those words, he went on foot amongst the <br/>
folk until he came to 'Utba b. Rabl'a and said, 'O Abu’l-Walld, you are <br/>
chief and lord of Quraysh and he whom they obey. Do you wish to be <br/>
remembered with praise among them to the end of time?’ 'Utba said, <br/>
‘Ilow' may that be, O Hakim ?’ He answered, ‘Lead them back and take up <br/>
the cause of your ally, 'Amr b. al-Hadrami.’ ‘I will do it,’ said 'Utba, ‘and <br/>
you are witness against me (if I break my word): he was under my protec¬ <br/>
tion, so it behoves me to pay his bloodwit and w 7 hat w 7 as seized of his wealth <br/>
(to his kinsmen). Now go you to Ibn al-Hanzaliya, for I do not fear that <br/>
any one will make trouble except him (362).’ Then 'Utba rose to speak <br/>
and said, ‘O people of Quraysh! By God, you wall gain naught by giving <br/>
battle to Muhammad and his companions. If you fall upon him, each one <br/>
of you will always be looking with loathing on the face of another w r ho has <br/>
slain the son of his paternal or maternal uncle or some man of his kin. <br/>
Therefore turn back and leave Muhammad to the rest of the Arabs. If <br/>
442 they kill him, that is what you want; and if it be otherwise, he will find <br/>
that you have not tried to do to him what you (in fact) wmuld have liked <br/>
to do.’ </p>
<p>HakI m said: ‘I went to Abu Jahl and found him oiling a coat of mail </p>
<p>(363) 1 which he had taken out of its bag. 1 said to him, “O Abu’l-Hakam, <br/>
'Utba has sent me to you with such-and-such a message,” and I told him <br/>
what 'Utba had said. “By God,” he cried, “his lungs became swollen (with <br/>
fear) w'hen he saw 7 Muhammad and his companions. No, by God, w 7 e will <br/>
not turn back until God decide between us and Muhammad. 'Utba does <br/>
not believe his own words, but he saw that Muhammad and his com¬ <br/>
panions are (in number as) the eaters of one slaughtered camel, and his <br/>
son is among them, so he is afraid lest you slay him.” Then he sent to <br/>
'Amir b. al-Hadrami, saying, “This ally of yours is for turning back w 7 ith <br/>
the folk at this time when you see your blood-revenge before your eyes. <br/>
Arise, therefore, and remind them of your covenant and the murder of <br/>
your brother.” 'Amir arose and uncovered; then he cried, “Alas for 'Amr! <br/>
Alas for 'Amr!” And w 7 ar was kindled and all was marred and the folk held <br/>
stubbornly on their evil course and 'Utba’s advice was w'asted on them. <br/>
When 'Utba heard how Abu Jahl had taunted him, he said, “He with the <br/>
befouled garment 2 will find out whose lungs are swollen, mine or his </p>
<p>(364) .”’ Then 'Utba looked for a helmet to put on his head; but seeing </p>
<p>1 Or ‘shield’, </p>
<p>2 A coarse expression for a coward. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 299 </p>
<p>that his head w r as so big that he could not find in the army a helmet that <br/>
would contain it, he wound a piece of cloth he had round his head. </p>
<p>Al-Aswad b. 'Abdu’l-Asad al-Makhzumi, who was a quarrelsome ill- <br/>
natured man, stepped forth and said, ‘I sw 7 ear to God that I will drink <br/>
from their cistern or destroy it or die before reaching it.’ Hamza b. 'Abdu- <br/>
’l-Muttalib came forth against him, and when the two met, Hamza smote <br/>
him and sent his foot and half his shank flying as he was near the cistern. </p>
<p>He fell on his back and lav there, blood streaming from his foot towards 443 <br/>
his comrades. Then he crawded to the cistern and threw 7 himself into it <br/>
with the purpose of fulfilling his oath, but Hamza followed him and smote <br/>
him and killed him in the cistern. </p>
<p>Then after him 'Utba b. Rabl'a stepped forth between his brother <br/>
Shayba and his son al-Walid b. 'Utba, and when he stood clear of the <br/>
ranks gave the challenge for single combat. Three men of the Ansar came <br/>
out against him: 'Auf and Mu'awwidh the sons of Harith (their mother <br/>
was 'Afra) and another man, said to have been 'Abdullah b. Rawaha. The <br/>
Quraysh said, ‘Who are you ?’ They answered, ‘Some of the Ansar,’ where¬ <br/>
upon the three of Quraysh said, ‘We have nothing to do with you.’ Then <br/>
the herald of Quraysh shouted, ‘O Muhammad! Send forth against us our <br/>
peers of our own tribe!’ The apostle said, ‘Arise, O 'Ubayda b. ljarith, <br/>
and arise, O Hamza, and arise, O 'All.’ And when they arose and ap¬ <br/>
proached them, the Quraysh said, ‘Who are you ?’ And having heard each <br/>
declare his name, they said, “Yes, these are noble and our peers.’ Now 7 <br/>
'Ubayda w 7 as the eldest of them, and he faced 'Utba b. Rabl'a, while <br/>
Hamza faced Shayba b. Rabl'a and 'All faced al-Walid b. 'Utba. It was <br/>
not long before Hamza slew 7 Shayba and 'All slew al-Walid. 'Ubayda and <br/>
'Utba exchanged tw 7 o blows with one another and each laid his enemy low. <br/>
Then Hamza and 'All turned on 'Utba with their swords and dispatched <br/>
him and bore aw ; ay their comrade and brought him back to his friends. </p>
<p>(T. 1318. 2. His leg had been cut off and the marrow w as oozing from it. <br/>
When they brought 'Ubayda to the prophet he said, ‘Am I not a martyr, </p>
<p>0 apostle of God?’ ‘Indeed you are,’ he replied. Then 'Ubayda said, <br/>
‘Were Abu Talib alive he would know that his words 1 </p>
<p>We will not give him up till we lie dead around him <br/>
And be unmindful of our women and children </p>
<p>are truly realized in me.’) 'Asim b. 'Umar b. Qatada told me that when <br/>
the men of the Ansar declared their lineage, 'Utba said, ‘You are noble <br/>
and our peers, but we desire men of our own tribe.’ </p>
<p>Then they advanced and drew near to one another. The apostle had <br/>
ordered his companions not to attack until he gave the word, and if the <br/>
enemy should surround them 2 they were to keep them off with showers of <br/>
arrows. He himself remained in the hut with Abu Bakr. 1 was informed <br/>
by Abu Ja'far Muhammad b. al-Husayn that the battle of Badr was fought </p>
<p>1 W. 174. 9. 2 T. 1318. ii ‘come near’. </p>
<p>30i </p>
<p>300 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>on Friday morning on the 17th of Ramadan. Habban b. Wasi' b. Habban <br/>
444 told me on the authority of some elders of his tribe that on the day of <br/>
Badr the apostle dressed the ranks of his companions with an arrow which <br/>
he held in his hand. As he passed by Sawad b. Ghazlya, an ally of B. <br/>
'Adiy b. al-Najjar (365), who was standing out (366) of line he pricked him <br/>
in his belly with the arrow, saying, ‘Stand in line, O Sawad!’ ‘You have <br/>
hurt me, 6 apostle of God,’ he cried, ‘and God has sent you with right and <br/>
justice so let me retaliate.’ The apostle uncovered his belly and said Take <br/>
your retaliation.’ Sawad embraced him and kissed his belly. He asked <br/>
what had made him do this and he replied, ‘O apostle of God, you see <br/>
what is befoYe us and I may not survive the battle and as this is my last <br/>
time with you I want my skin to touch yours.’ The apostle blessed him. </p>
<p>Then the apostle straightened the ranks and returned to the hut and <br/>
entered it, and none was with him there but Abu Bakr. The apostle was <br/>
beseeching his Lord for the help which He had promised to him, and <br/>
among his words were these: ‘O God, if this band perish today Thou wilt <br/>
be worshipped no more.’ But Abu Bakr said, 0 prophet of God, your <br/>
constant entreaty will annoy thy Lord, for surely God will fulfil His <br/>
promise to thee.’ While the apostle was in the hut he slept a light sleep; <br/>
then he awoke and said, ‘Be of good cheer, O Abu Bakr. God s help is <br/>
come to you. Here is Gabriel holding the rein of a horse and leading it. <br/>
The dust is upon his front teeth.’ </p>
<p>’(’he first Muslim that fell was Mihja', a freedman of 'Umar: he was shot <br/>
by an arrow. Then while Haritha b. Suraqa, one of B. 'Adiy b. al-Najjar, <br/>
was drinking from the cistern an arrow pierced his throat and killed him. </p>
<p>445 Then the apostle went forth to the people and incited them saying, ‘ By <br/>
God in whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, no man will be slain this <br/>
day fighting against them with steadfast courage advancing not retreating <br/>
but God wall cause him to enter Paradise.’ 'Umayr b. al-Humam brother <br/>
of B. Salima was eating some dates which he had in his hand. ‘Fine, Fine!’ <br/>
said he, ‘is there nothing between me and my entering Paradise save to be <br/>
killed by these men ?’ He flung the dates from his hand, seized his sword, <br/>
and fought against them till he w’as slain, [saying the while </p>
<p>In God’s service take no food <br/>
But piety and deeds of good. </p>
<p>If in God’s war you’ve firmly stood <br/>
You need not fear as others should <br/>
While you are righteous true and good.] 1 </p>
<p>'Asim b. 'Umar b. Qatada told me that 'Auf b. Harith—his mother was <br/>
‘Afra’—said ‘O apostle of God, what makes the Lord laugh with joy at His <br/>
servant?’ He answered, ‘When he plunges into the midst of the enemy <br/>
without mail.’ 'Auf drew' off the mail-coat that was on him and threw it <br/>
away: then he seized his sword and fought the enemy till he was slain. </p>
<p>1 Mawardi, 67. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Muhammad b. Muslim b. Shihab al-Zuhrl on the authority of 'Abdullah <br/>
b. Tha'laba b. Su'ayr al-'Udhri, an ally of B. Zuhra, told me that when the <br/>
warriors advanced to battle and drew' near to one another Abu Jahl cried, </p>
<p>‘0 God, destroy this morning him that more than any of us hath cut the <br/>
ties of kinship and wrought that which is not approved.’ 1 Thus he con¬ <br/>
demned himself to death. </p>
<p>Then the apostle took a handful of small pebbles and said, turning <br/>
towards Quraysh, ‘Foul be those faces!’ Then he threw the pebbles at <br/>
them and ordered his companions to charge. The foe was routed. God <br/>
slew many of their chiefs and made captive many of their nobles. Mean¬ <br/>
while the apostle was in the hut and Sa'd b. Mu'adh was standing at the <br/>
door of the hut girt with his sword. With him were some of the Ansar <br/>
guarding the apostle for fear lest the enemy should come back at him. <br/>
While the folk were laying hands on the prisoners the apostle, as I have <br/>
been told, saw displeasure on the face of Sa'd at what they were doing. He <br/>
said to him, ‘You seem to dislike what the people are doing.’ ‘Yes, by 446 <br/>
God,’ he replied, ‘it is the first defeat that God has brought on the infidel <br/>
and I would rather see them slaughtered than left alive.’ </p>
<p>Al-'Abbas b. 'Abdullah b. Ma'bad from one of his family from Ibn <br/>
'Abbas told me that the latter said that the prophet said to his companions <br/>
that day, ‘I know that some of B. Hashim and others have been forced to <br/>
come out against their will and have no desire to fight us; so if any of you <br/>
meet one of B. Hashim or Abu’l-Bakhtari or al-'Abbas the apostle’s uncle <br/>
do not kill him, for he has been made to come out against his will.’ Abu <br/>
Hudhayfa said: ‘Are we to kill our fathers and our sons and our brothers <br/>
and our families and leave al-'Abbas ? By God, if I meet him I will flesh <br/>
my sword in him!’ (367). </p>
<p>This saying reached the apostle’s ears and he said to 'Umar, ‘O Abu <br/>
Hafs’—and 'Umar said that this was the first time the apostle called him <br/>
by this honorific—‘ought the face of the apostle’s uncle to be marked with <br/>
the sword?’ 'Umar replied, ‘Let me off with his head! By God, the man <br/>
is a false Muslim.’ 2 Abu Hudhayfa used to say, ‘I never felt safe after my <br/>
words that day. I was always afraid unless martyrdom atoned for them.’ </p>
<p>He was killed as a martyr in the battle of al-Yamama. </p>
<p>The reason w'hy the apostle forbade the killing of Abu’l-Bakhtari was <br/>
because he had kept back the people in Mecca from the apostle; he never <br/>
insulted him or did anything offensive; and lie took a prominent part in <br/>
the cancelling of the boycott which Quraysh had written against 13 . Hashim <br/>
and B. al-Muttalib. Now' al-Mujadhdhar b. Dhiyad al-BalavvI, an ally of <br/>
the Ansar, of the clan of B. Salim b. 'Auf, fell in with him and told him <br/>
that the apostle had forbidden them to kill him. Now al-'As Abu’l-Bakh- </p>
<p>1 v.i. W. 478. </p>
<ul>
<li>The verb from which mtmafiqutt , generally rendered ‘hypocrites’, is formed. Clearly it <br/>
includes the meaning of a rebel against the prophet’s authority; perhaps the underlying idea <br/>
is feigned obedience. </li>
</ul>
<p>302 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>447 tari was accompanied by his fellow-rider Junada b. Mulayha d. Zuhayr b. <br/>
al-Harith b. Asad who was one of B. Layth, and he said, ‘And what about <br/>
my friend here?’ ‘No, by God,’ said al-Mujadhdhar, ‘we are not going to <br/>
spare your friend. The apostle gave us orders about you only.’ ‘In that <br/>
case,’ he said, ‘I will die with him. The women of Mecca shall not say that <br/>
I forsook my friend to save my own life.’ hie uttered this rajaz as al- <br/>
Mujadhdhar came at him and he insisted on fighting: </p>
<p>A son of the free betrays not his friend </p>
<p>Till he’s dead, or sees him safe on his way. </p>
<p>The result was that al-Mujadhdhar killed him and composed these lines <br/>
thereon: </p>
<p>Do you not know or have you forgotten ? </p>
<p>Then note well my line is from Bali. </p>
<p>Those who thrust with Yazani spears </p>
<p>Smiting down chiefs and bringing them low. </p>
<p>Tell Bakhtari that he’s bereaved of his father </p>
<p>Or tell my son the like of me. </p>
<p>I am he of whom it is said my origin is in Bali. </p>
<p>When I thrust in my spear it bends almost double. </p>
<p>I kill my opponent with a sharp MashrafI sword, </p>
<p>I yearn for death like a camel overfull with milk. </p>
<p>You will not see Mujadhdhar telling a lie (368). </p>
<p>Then al-Mujadhdhar went to the apostle and told him that he had done <br/>
his best to take him prisoner and bring him to him but that he had insisted <br/>
on fighting and the result had been fatal to him (369). </p>
<p>448 Yahya b. 'Abbad b. 'Abdullah b. al-Zubavr told me on the authority of <br/>
his father; and 'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr and others on the authority of <br/>
'Abdu’l-Rahman b. 'Auf told me the same, saying: 'Umayya b. Khalaf was <br/>
a friend of mine in Mecca and my name was 'Abdu 'Amr, but I was called <br/>
'Abdu’l-Rahman when I became a Muslim. When we used to meet in <br/>
Mecca he would say, “Do you dislike the name your parents gave you?” <br/>
and I would say yes; and he would say, “As for me, I don’t know al- <br/>
Rahman, so adopt a name which I can call you between ourselves. You <br/>
won’t reply to your original name, and I won’t use one I don’t know.” <br/>
When he said “O 'Abdu'Amr” I wouldn’t answer him, and finally I said ,“0 <br/>
Abu 'All, call me what you like,” and he called me “ 'Abdu’l-Ilah” and I <br/>
accepted the name from him. On the day of Badr I passed by him standing <br/>
with his son 'All holding him by the hand. I was carrying coats of mail <br/>
which I had looted; and when he saw me he said, “O 'Abdu 'Amr,” but <br/>
I would not answer until he said “O 'Abdu’l-Ilah.” Then he said, “Won’t <br/>
you take me prisoner, for I am more valuable than these coats of mail <br/>
which you have ?” “By God I will,” I said. So I threw away the mail and <br/>
took him and his son by the hand, he saying the while “I never saw a day </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 303 </p>
<p>like this. Have you no use for milk?” Then I walked off with the pair of <br/>
them (370). * </p>
<p>'A^ b u U rM V5l,nd H b ' Aba Aun fr0m SaV1 b - ibr5h &gt;m from his father <br/>
r n L , mSn Auf t0ld m£ that lhc Iatter said: Imavva said to me <br/>
as I walked between them holding their hands, ‘Who is that man who is <br/>
wearing an ostrich feather on his breast?’ When I told him it was Hamza <br/>
e said that it was he who had done them so much damage. As I was <br/>
leading them away Bilal saw him with me. Now it was Umayya who used <br/>
to torture Bilal in Mecca to make him abandon Islam, bringing him out to <br/>
the scorching heat of the sun, laying him on his back, and putting a great <br/>
stone on his chest, telling him that he could stay there until he gave up the 449 <br/>
religion of Muhammad, and Bilal kept saying ‘One! One!’ As'soon as he <br/>
saw him he said, The arch-infidel Umayya b. Khalaf! May I not live if <br/>
he lives. I said, ‘(Would you attack) my prisoners ?’ But he kept crying out <br/>
these words m spite of my remonstrances until finally he shouted at the <br/>
top of his voice, ‘O God’s Helpers, the arch-infidel Umayya b. Khalaf! </p>
<p>May I not live if he lives.’ The people formed a ring round us as I was <br/>
protecting him. Then a man drew his sword 1 and cut off his son’s foot so <br/>
that he fell down and Umayya let out a cry such as I have never heard • and <br/>
I said to him‘Make your escape’ (though he had no chance of escape) ‘I can <br/>
do nothing for you.’ They hewed them to pieces with their swords until <br/>
they were dead. Abdu’l-Rahman used to say, ‘God have mercy on Bilal, <br/>
i lost my coats of mail and he deprived me of my prisoners.’ </p>
<p>f iw-v'r-h b ‘ Ahu Babr toId me he was toIti as from I bn 'Abbas: ‘A man <br/>
ot BGhifar told me: I and a cousin of mine went up a hill from which we <br/>
could look down on Badr, we being polytheists waiting to see the result of <br/>
the battle so that we could join in the looting. And while we were on the <br/>
hill a cloud came near and we heard the neighing of horses and I heard one <br/>
saying Forward, HayzOm!” 2 As for my cousin, his heart burst asunder <br/>
and he died on the spot; I almost perished, then I pulled myself together.’ </p>
<p>Abdullah b. Abu Bakr from one of B. Sa'ida from Abu Usavd Malik <br/>
b. Rabi a who was present at Badr told him after he had lost his sight: ‘If <br/>
I were in Badr today and had my sight I could show you the glen from <br/>
which the angels emerged. I have not the slightest doubt on the point.’ </p>
<p>My father Ishaq b. Yasiir from men of B. Mazin b. al-Najjar from Abu <br/>
Da ud aKMaz.nl, who was at Badr, told me: ‘I was pursuing a polvtheist 450 <br/>
at Badr to smite him, when his head fell off before I could get at him with <br/>
my sword, and I knew that someone else had killed him.’ </p>
<p>One above suspicion from Miqsam, freedman of 'Abdullah b al-I-Iarith <br/>
from 'Abdullah b. 'Abbas, told me, ‘The sign of the angels at Badr was <br/>
white turbans flowing behind them: at Ilunayn thev wore red turbans’ </p>

<p>304 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>did not fight in any battle but Badr. In the other battles they were there as <br/>
reinforcements, but they did not fight. </p>
<p>As he was fighting that day Abu Jahl was saying: </p>
<p>What has fierce war to dislike about me, </p>
<p>A young he-camel with razor-like teeth ? </p>
<p>For this very purpose did my mother bear me (372). </p>
<p>When the apostle had finished with the enemy he ordered that Abu Jahl <br/>
should be looked for among the slain. (T. He said, ‘O God, don’t let him <br/>
escape Thee!’) The first man to find him—so Thaur b. Yazld from 'Ikrima <br/>
from Ibn 'Abbas told me; as well as 'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr who told me <br/>
the same—was Mu'adh b. 'Arm* b. al-Jamuh, brother of B. Salama, whom <br/>
they reported as saying: I heard the people saying when Abu Jahl was in a <br/>
sort of thicket, 'Abu’l-Hakam cannot be got at’ (373). When I heard that </p>
<p>451 I made it my business, and made for him. When I got within striking dis¬ <br/>
tance I fell upon him and fetched him a blow which sent his foot and half <br/>
his shank flying. I can only liken it to a date-stone flying from the pestle <br/>
when it is beaten. His son 'Ikrima struck me on the shoulder and severed <br/>
my arm and it hung by the skin from my side, and the battle compelled me <br/>
to leave him. 1 fought the whole of the day dragging my arm behind me <br/>
and when it became painful to me I put my foot on it and standing on it I <br/>
tore it off.’ He lived after that into the reign of 'Uthman. </p>
<p>Mu'awwidh b. 'Afra’ passed Abu Jahl as he lay there helpless and smote <br/>
him until he left him at his last gasp. He himself went on fighting until he <br/>
was killed. Then 'Abdullah b. Mas'ud passed by Abu Jahl when the apostle <br/>
had ordered that he was to be searched for among the slain. I have heard <br/>
that the apostle had told them that if he was hidden among the corpses <br/>
they were to look for the trace of a scar on his knee. When they both were <br/>
young they had been pressed together at the table of 'Abdullah b. Jud'an. <br/>
He was thinner than Abu Jahl and he gave him a push which sent him to <br/>
his knees and one of them was scratched so deeply that it left a permanent <br/>
scar. 'Abdullah b. Mas'ud said that he found him at his last gasp and put <br/>
his foot on his neck (for he had once clawed at him and punched him in <br/>
Mecca), and said to him: ‘Has God put you to shame, you enemy of God?’ <br/>
He replied ‘How has He shamed me? Am I anything more remarkable <br/>
than a man you have killed? 1 Tell me how the battle went. He told him <br/>
that it went in favour of God and His apostle (374). </p>
<p>Men of B. Makhzum assert that Ibn Mas'ud used to say: He said to me, </p>
<p>452 ‘You have climbed high, you little shepherd.’ Then I cut off his head and <br/>
brought it to the apostle saying, ‘This is the head of the enemy of God, <br/>
Abu Jahl.’ He said, ‘By God than Whom there is no other, is it?’ (This <br/>
used to be his oath.) ‘Yes,’ I said, and I threw his head before the apostle <br/>
and he gave thanks to God (375). </p>
<p>1 This is a difficult expression much commented on by Arab writers: other possibilities <br/>
are: ‘Am 1 to wonder at, or be angry’, &amp;c. Cf. Lane, 2151c and 'gab. Glos. 376. </p>

<p>'Ukkasha b. Mihsan b. Hurthan al-Asadi, ally of B. 'Abdu Shams, fought <br/>
at Badr until his sword was broken in his hand. He came to the apostle <br/>
who gave him a wooden cudgel telling him to fight with that. When he <br/>
took it he brandished it and it became in his hand a long, strong, gleaming <br/>
sword, and he fought with it until God gave victory to the Muslims. The <br/>
sword was called al-'Aun and he had it with him in all the battles he fouaht <br/>
with the apostle until finally he was killed in the rebellion, still holding it. </p>
<p>Tulay(ia b. Khuwayhd al-Asadi 1 killed him, and this is what he said <br/>
about it: </p>
<p>What do you think about a people when you kill them? </p>
<p>Are they not men though they are not Muslims ? </p>
<p>If camels and women *were captured <br/>
Fou will not get away scatheless after killing Hibah <br/>
I set Himala’s breast against them—a mare well used to <br/>
The cry of ‘Warriors dow r n to the fight!’ </p>
<p>(One day you see her protected and covered, </p>
<p>Another day unencumbered dash to the fray) </p>
<p>The night I left Ibn Aqram lying </p>
<p>And 'Ukkasha the Ghanmite dead on the field (376). 453 </p>
<p>When the apostle said, '70,000 of my people shall enter Paradise like the <br/>
u moon Ukkasha asked if he could be one of them, and the apostle <br/>
prayed that he might be one. One of the Ansar got up and asked that he <br/>
too might be one of them, and he replied, "Ukkasha has forestalled you <br/>
and the prayer is cold.’ J </p>
<p>I have heard from his family that the apostle said: ‘Ours is the-best <br/>
horseman among the Arabs,’ and when we asked who, he said that i, was <br/>
Ukkasha When Dirar b. al-Azwar al-Asadi said, ‘That is a man of ours ’ <br/>
the apostle answered, ‘He is not yours but ours through alliance’ (177). ’ </p>
<p>latIr Z s‘ a d ;d'‘wi! nan k fr0m l ! rWa b ' al * Zubayr from 'A’isha told me that the <br/>

body dintegrated;.so they left it where it was and heaped earth and stones <br/>
upon it As they threw them into the pit the apostle stood and said- “O <br/>

<p>Humayd al-Tawil told me that Anas b. Malik said: ‘The apostle’s com¬ <br/>
panions heard him saying in the middle of the night “O people of the pit: <br/>
O 'Utba, O Shayba, 0 Umayya, O Abu Jahl,” enumerating all who had <br/>
been thrown into the pit, “Have you found that what God promised you <br/>
is true? I have found that what my Lord promised me is true.” The <br/>
Muslims said, “Are you calling to dead bodies?” He answered: “You <br/>
cannot hear what I say better than they, but they cannot answer me.”’ </p>
<p>A learned person told me that the apostle said that day, ‘O people of the <br/>
pit, you were an evil kinsfolk to your prophet. You called me a liar when <br/>
others believed me; you cast me out when others took me in; you fought <br/>
against me when others fought on my side.’ Then he added ‘Have you <br/>
found that what your Lord promised you is true?’ </p>
<p>Hassan b. Thabit said: </p>
<p>I recognize the dwellings of Zaynab on the sandhill <br/>

<p>Were once the abodes of dearly loved friends. </p>
<p>Abandon this constant refnembrance of them, </p>
<p>Quench the heat of the sorrowing breast. </p>
<p>Tell the truth about that in which there is no shame, </p>
<p>Not the tale of a liar, </p>
<p>Of what God did on the day of Badr, </p>
<p>Giving us victory over the polytheists. </p>
<p>The day when their multitude was like Hira’ </p>
<p>Whose foundations appear at sunset. </p>
<p>We met them with a company <br/>
Like lions of the jungle young and old <br/>
455 In defence of Muhammad in the heat of war </p>
<p>Helping him against the enemy. </p>
<p>In their hands were sharp swords <br/>
And well-tried shafts with thick knots. </p>
<p>The sons of Aus the leaders, helped by <br/>
The sons of al-Najjar in the strong religion. </p>
<p>Abu Jahl we left lying prostrate <br/>
And f Utba we left on the ground. </p>
<p>Shayba too with others <br/>
Of noble name and descent. </p>
<p>The apostle of God called to them <br/>
When we cast them into the pit together. </p>
<p>‘Have you found that I spoke the truth? </p>
<p>And the command of God takes hold of the heart ?’ </p>
<p>1 I follow S.’s suggestion for the meaning of qashib. </p>
<p>3°7 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>They spoke not. Had they spoken they would have said, </p>
<p>‘Thou wast right and thy judgment was sound.’ </p>
<p>, When thc a P° stIe g av e the order for them to be thrown into the pit <br/>
Utba was dragged to it. I have been told that the apostle looked at the <br/>
face of his son Abu Hudhayfa, and lo he was sad and his colour had <br/>
changed. He said, ‘I fear that you feel deeply the fate of your father’ or <br/>
words to that effect. ‘No,’ he said, ‘I have no misgivings about my father <br/>
and his death, but I used to know my father as a wise, cultured, and vir¬ <br/>
tuous man and so I hoped that he would be guided to Islam. ’ When I <br/>
saw what had befallen him and that he had died in unbelief after my hopes <br/>
for him it saddened me. The apostle blessed him and spoke kindly to him. </p>
<p>I have been told that the Quran came down about certain men who were <br/>
killed at Badr: Those whom the angels took who were wronging them¬ <br/>
selves they asked, What were you (doing) ? They said: We were oppressed <br/>
m the earth. They said: Was not God’s earth wide enough that you could <br/>
have migrated therein ? As for them their habitation will be hell—an evil 456 <br/>
resort ” They were: al-Harith b. Zama'a; Abu Qays b. al-Fakih; Abu <br/>
Qays b. al-Walid; 'All b. Umayya; and al-'As b. Munabbih. These had <br/>
been Muslims while the apostle was in Mecca. When he migrated to <br/>
Medina their fathers and families in Mecca shut them up and seduced <br/>
them and they let themselves be seduced. Then they joined their people <br/>
in the expedition to Badr and were all killed. </p>
<p>Then the apostle ordered that everything that had been collected in the <br/>
camp should be brought together, and the Muslims quarrelled about it. <br/>
Those who had collected it claimed it, and those who had fought and <br/>
pursued thc enemy claimed that had it not been for them there would <br/>
have been no booty and that had they not engaged the enemv they would <br/>
not have been able to get anything; while those who were guarding the <br/>
apostle lest the enemy should attack him claimed that they had an equal <br/>
right, for they had wanted to fight the enemy, and they had wanted to <br/>
seize the booty when there was none to defend it, but they were afraid <br/>
that the enemy might return to the charge and so thev kept their position <br/>
round the apostle. </p>
<p>'Abdu’l-Rahman b. al-Harith and others of our friends from Sulavman <br/>
b. Musa from Makhul from Abu Umama al-Bahill (378) said: ‘I asked <br/>
Ubada b. al-Samit about the chapter of al-Anfal and he said that it came <br/>
down concerning those who took part in the battle of Badr when thev <br/>
quarrelled about the booty and showed their evil nature. God took it out <br/>
of their hands and gave it to the apostle, and he divided it equally among <br/>
the Muslims.’ ' 6 </p>
<p>‘Abdullah b. Abu Bakr told me that Malik b. Rabi'a one of B. Sa'ida 457 <br/>
from Abu Usayd al-Sa'idi said: ‘I got a sword belonging to B. ‘A’idh the <br/>
Makhzumites which was called al-Marzuban, and when the apostle ordered </p>

</ol>
<p>308 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>everyone to turn in what they had taken I came and threw it into the heap <br/>
of spoils. Now the apostle never held back anything he was asked for and <br/>
al-Arqam b. Abu’l-Arqam knew this and asked him for it and the apostle <br/>
gave it him.’ </p>
<p>Then the apostle sent 'Abdullah b. Rawaha with the good news of the <br/>
victory to the people of Upper Medina, and Zayd b. Haritha to the people <br/>
of Lower Medina. Usama b. Zayd said: ‘The news came to us as we had <br/>
heaped earth on Ruqayya the apostle’s daughter who was married to <br/>
'Uthman b. 'Affan, (the apostle having left me behind with 'Uthman to <br/>
look after her), that Zayd b. Haritha had come. So I went to him as he <br/>
was standing in the place of prayer surrounded by the people, and he was <br/>
saying: “ 'Utba and Shayba and Abu Jahl and Zama'a and Abu’I-Bakhtar! <br/>
and Umayya and Nubayh and Munabbih have been slain.” I said, “Is <br/>
this true, my father?” and he said, “Yes, by God it is, my son.”’ </p>
<p>Then the apostle began his return journey to Medina with the un¬ <br/>
believing prisoners, among whom were 'Uqba b. Abu Mu'ayt and al-Nadr <br/>
b. al-Harith. The apostle carried with him the booty that had been taken <br/>
from the polytheists and put 'Abdullah b. Ka'b in charge of it. A rajaz <br/>
poet of the Muslims (379) said: </p>
<p>Start your camels, O Basbas) </p>
<p>There’s no halting-place in Dhu Talh 1 <br/>
458 Nor in the desert of Ghumayr a pen. </p>
<p>The people’s camels cannot be locked up. </p>
<p>So to set them on the way is wiser </p>
<p>God having given victory and Akhnas having fled. </p>
<p>Then the apostle went forward until when he came out of the pass of <br/>
al-Safra’ he halted on the sandhill between the pass and al-Naziya called <br/>
Sayar at a tree there and divided the booty which God had granted to the <br/>
Muslims equally. 2 Then he marched until he reached Rauha’ when the <br/>
Muslims met him congratulating him and the Muslims on the victory God <br/>
had given him. Salama b. Salama—so 'Asim b. ‘Umar b. Qatada and <br/>
Yazld b. Ruman told me—said, ‘What are you congratulating us about? <br/>
By God, we only met some bald old women like the sacrificial camels <br/>
who are hobbled, and we slaughtered them!’ The apostle smiled and <br/>
said, ‘But, nephew, those were the chiefs’ (380). When the apostle was in <br/>
al-Safra’, al-Nadr was killed by ‘All, as a learned Meccan told me. When <br/>
he was in 'Irqu’l-Zabya 'Uqba was killed (381). He had been captured by <br/>
'Abdullah b. Salima, one of the B. al-'Ajlan. </p>
<p>When the apostle ordered him to be killed 'Uqba said, ‘But who will <br/>
look after my children, O Muhammad?’ ‘Hell’, he said, and 'Asim b. <br/>
Thabit b. Abu’l-Aqlah al-Ansari killed him according to what Abu <br/>
'Ubayda b. Muhammad b. 'Ammar b. Yasir told me (382). </p>
<p>1 Or, possibly, acacia trees; no place for them to halt. </p>
<p>1 T. adds; ‘He drank from the water there called al-Arwaq’. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad yog </p>
<p>Abu Hind, freedman of Farwa b. 'Amr al-Bayadi, met the apostle there <br/>
with a jar full of butter and dates (383). He had stayed behind from Badr <br/>
but was present at all the other battles and afterwards became the apostle’s </p>
<p>cupper. The apostle said, ‘Abu Hind is one of the Ansar; intermarry with 450 <br/>
him, and they did so. </p>
<p>The apostle arrived in Medina a day before the prisoners. 'Abdullah b <br/>
Abu Bakr told me that Yahya b. 'Abdullah b. 'Abdu’I-Rahman b. As'ad b.' <br/>
Zurara told him that the prisoners were brought in when Sauda d. Zama'a <br/>
the wife of the prophet, was with the family of 'Afra’ when they were be¬ <br/>
wailing 'Auf and Mu'awwidh 'Afra”s sons, this being before the veil was <br/>
imposed on them. Sauda said: ‘As I was with them, suddenly it was said: </p>
<p>Here are the prisoners” and I returned to my house where the apostle <br/>
was. And there was Abu Yazld Suhayl b. 'Amr in a corner of the room <br/>
with his hands tied to his neck. I could hardly contain myself when I saw <br/>
Abu Yazld in this state and I said, “O Abu Yazld, you surrendered too <br/>
readily, \ou ought to have died a noble death!” Suddenly the pro¬ <br/>
phet’s voice startled me: “Sauda, would you stir up trouble against God <br/>
and his apostle?” I said, “By God, I could hardly contain myself when I <br/>
saw Abu Yazld in this state and that is why i said what I did ” ’ </p>
<p>Nubayh b. Wahb brother of B. 'Abdu’l-Dar told me that the apostle <br/>
divided the prisoners amongst his companions and said, ‘Treat them well.’ </p>
<p>Now Abu 'Aziz b. 'Umayr b. Hashim, brother of Mus'ab b. 'Umayr by <br/>
the same mother and father, was among the prisoners and he said, ‘My <br/>
brother Mus'ab passed by me as one of the Ansar was binding me and he <br/>
said: “Bind him fast, for his mother is a wealthy woman; perhaps she will <br/>
redeem him from you.” I was with a number of the Ansar when they <br/>
brought me from Badr, and when they ate their morning and evening <br/>
meals they gave me the bread and ate the dates themselves in accordance <br/>
with the orders that the apostle had given about us. If anyone had a 460 <br/>
morsel ot bread he gave it to me. I felt ashamed and returned it to one of <br/>
them but he returned it to me untouched’ {384). </p>
<p>The first to come to Mecca with news of the disaster was al-Haysuman <br/>
b. Abdullah al-Khuza i, and when they asked for news he enumerated all <br/>
the Quraysh chiefs who had been killed. Safwan who was sitting in the <br/>
hij r said, ‘This fellow is out of his mind. Ask him about me.’ So they <br/>
said: ‘What happened to Safwan b. Umayya?’ He answered, ‘There he is <br/>
sitting in the hijr } and by God I saw his father and his brother when they <br/>
were killed.’ 1 </p>
<p>Uusayn b. 'Abdullah b. 'Ubaydallah b. 'Abbas from 'Ikrima, freedman <br/>
ot I bn Abbas, tojd me that Abu Rafi', freedman of the apostle, said, ‘I used <br/>
to be a slave of 'Abbas. Islam had entered among us, the people of the <br/>
house; <em>'Abbas had become a Muslim,</em> and so had Ummu’l-FadI and so <br/>
had L But 'Abbas was afraid of his people and disliked to go against them, <br/>
so he hid his faith; he had a great deal of money scattered among the </p>
<p>These words are not found in q\’s quotation from I. I, </p>
<p>310 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>people. Abu Lahab had stayed behind from the Badr expedition sending <br/>
in his stead ai-'As b. Hisham; for that is what they did—any man who <br/>
stayed behind sent another in his place. And when news came of the <br/>
Quraysh disaster at Badr God humiliated Abu Lahab and put him to <br/>
shame w'hile we found ourselves in a position of power and respect. Now <br/>
I was a weak man and I used to make arrows, sharpening them in the tent <br/>
of Zamzam, and lo as I was sitting there with Ummu’l-Fadl sharpening <br/>
arrows delighted with the news that had come, up came Abu Lahab <br/>
dragging his feet in ill temper and sat down at the end of the tent with his <br/>
back to mine. As he was sitting there people said, “Here is Abu Sufyan b. <br/>
al-Harith b. 'Abdu’l-Muttalib (385) just arrived.” Abu Lahab said, <br/>
“Come here, for you have news.” So he came and sat with him while the <br/>
people stood round, and when he asked his nephew for the news he said, <br/>
“As soon as we met the party we turned our backs and they w r ere killing <br/>
and capturing us just as they pleased; and by God I don’t blame the people <br/>
for that. We met men in white on piebald horses between heaven and <br/>
earth, and by God they spared nothing and none could withstand them.” <br/>
So I lifted the rope of the tent and said: “Those w r ere the angels.” Abu <br/>
Lahab struck me violently in the face. I leapt at him, but he knocked me <br/>
down and knelt on me beating me again and again, for I w'as a weak man. <br/>
Ummu’l-Fadl went and got one of the supports of the tent and split his <br/>
head with a blow which left a nasty wound, saying, “You think you can <br/>
despise him now his master is away!” He got up and turned tail humiliated. <br/>
He only lived for another week, for God smote him with pustules, from <br/>
which he died.* </p>
<p>(T. 1340. 10. His two sons left him unburied for two or three nights so <br/>
that the house stank (for the Quraysh dread pustules and the like as men <br/>
dread plague) until finally a man said to them: ‘It is disgraceful! Are you <br/>
not ashamed that your father should stink in his house while you do not <br/>
cover him from the sight of men ?’ They replied that they were afraid of <br/>
those ulcers. He offered to go with them. They did not w'ash the body <br/>
but threw water over it from a distance without touching it. Then they <br/>
took it up and buried it on the high ground above Mecca by a wall and <br/>
threw stones over it until it was covered. </p>
<p>Ibn Hamid said that Salama b. al-Fadl said that Muhammad b. Ishaq <br/>
said that al-'Abbas b. 'Abdullah b. Ma'bad from one of his family on the <br/>
authority of 'Abdullah b. 'Abbas said: ‘On the night of Badr w f hen the <br/>
prisoners were safely guarded, the apostle could not sleep during the first <br/>
part of the night. When his companions asked him the reason he said: <br/>
“I heard the writhing of al-'Abbas in his prison.” So they got up and <br/>
liberated him whereupon the apostle slept soundly.’ </p>
<p>On the same authority I heard that Muhammad b. Ishaq said: ‘“al- <br/>
Hasan b. 'Umara told me from al-Hakam b. 'Utayba from Miqsam from <br/>
Ibn 'Abbas: The man who captured al-'Abbas was Abu’I-Yasar Ka'b b. <br/>
'Amr brother of the B. Salima. Abu’I-Yasar was a compact little man </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 311 </p>
<p>while al-'Abbas w r as bulky. When the apostle asked the former how he <br/>
had managed to capture him, he said that a man such as he had never seen <br/>
before or afterwards had helped him, and when he described him, the <br/>
apostle said, “A noble angel helped you against him.’”) </p>
<p>(Suhayll, ii. 79: In the riwdya of Yunus I. I. recorded that the apostle <br/>
saw her (Ummu’l-Fadl) when she was a baby crawling before him and <br/>
said, ‘If she grows up and I am still alive I will marry her.’ But he died <br/>
before she grew up and Sufyan b. al-Aswad b. 'Abdu’l-Asad al-Makhzuml <br/>
married her and she bore him Rizq and Lubiiba. . . . </p>
<p>They did not bury Abu Lahab, but he was put against a wall and stones <br/>
were thrown upon him from behind the wall until he was covered. It is <br/>
said that when 'A’isha passed the place she used to veil her face.) </p>
<p>Yahya b. 'Abbad b. 'Abdullah b. al-Zubayr from his father 'Abbad told <br/>
me that Quraysh bewailed their dead. Then they said, ‘Do not do this, <br/>
for the news will reach Muhammad and his companions and they will <br/>
rejoice over your misfortune; and do not send messengers about your <br/>
captives but hold back so that Muhammad and his companions may not <br/>
demand excessive ransoms.’ Al-Aswad b. al-Muttalib had lost three of his <br/>
sons: Zama'a, ‘Aqll, and al-Harith b. Zama'a, and he wanted to bewail <br/>
them. Meanwhile he heard a weeping woman, and as he was blind he told a <br/>
servant to go and see whether lamentation had been permitted, for if Quraysh <br/>
were weeping over their dead he might weep for Zam'a Abu Haklma, for 4^z <br/>
he was consumed by a burning sorrow. The servant returned to say that <br/>
it was a woman weeping over a camel she had lost. Thereupon he said: </p>
<p>Does she weep because she has lost a camel ? </p>
<p>And does this keep her awake all night ? </p>
<p>Weep not over a young camel </p>
<p>But over Badr where hopes were dashed to the ground. </p>
<p>Over Badr the finest of the sons of Husays <br/>
And Makhzum and the clan of Abu’l-Walld. </p>
<p>Weep if you must weep over 'Aqll, </p>
<p>Weep for Harith the lion of lions, </p>
<p>Weep unweariedly for them all, </p>
<p>For Abu Hakima had no peer. </p>
<p>Now they are dead, men bear rule </p>
<p>Who but for Badr would be of little account (386). </p>
<p>Among the prisoners was Abu Wada'a b. Dubayra al-Sahml. The <br/>
apostle remarked that in Mecca he had a son who was a shrewd and rich <br/>
merchant and that he would soon come to redeem his father. When <br/>
Quraysh counselled delay in redeeming the prisoners so that the ransom <br/>
should not be extortionate al-Muttalib b. Abu Wada'a—the man the <br/>
apostle meant—said, ‘You arc right. Don’t be in a hurry.’ And he slipped <br/>
away at night and came to Medina and recovered his father for 4,000 <br/>
dirhams and took him away. </p>
<p>312 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Then Quraysh sent to redeem the prisoners and Mikraz b. Hafs b. al- <br/>
Akhyaf came about Suhayl b. 'Amr who had been captured by Malik b. <br/>
al-Dukhshum, brother of the B. Salim b. 'Auf, who said: </p>
<p>I captured Suhayl and I would not exchange him <br/>
For a prisoner from any other people. </p>
<p>Khindif knows that its hero is Suhayl <br/>
When injustice is complained of. </p>
<p>I struck with my keen sword until it bent. </p>
<p>I forced myself to fight this hare-lipped man. </p>
<p>Suhayl was a man whose lower lip was split (387). </p>
<p>463 Muhammad b. 'Amr b. 'Ata brother of B. 'Amir b. Lu’ayy, told me <br/>
that 'Umar said to the apostle, ‘Let me pull out Suhayl’s two front teeth; <br/>
his tongue will stick out and he will never be able to speak against you <br/>
again.’ He answered, ‘I will not mutilate him, otherwise God would muti¬ <br/>
late me though I am a prophet.’ </p>
<p>I have heard that in this tradition the apostle said to 'Umar, ‘Perhaps he <br/>
will make a stand for which you will not blame him’ 1 (388). </p>
<p>When Mikraz had spoken about him and finally agreed on terms with <br/>
them they demanded the money, and he asked that they would hold him <br/>
as security and let Suhayl go so that he could send his ransom. They did <br/>
so and imprisoned Mikraz in his stead. Mikraz said: </p>
<p>I redeemed with costly 2 she-camels a captive hero. </p>
<p>(The payment is for a true Arab not for clients). </p>
<p>I pledged my person, though money would be easier for me. </p>
<p>But I feared being put to shame. </p>
<p>I said, 'Suhayl is the best of us, so take him back </p>
<p>To our sons so that we may attain our desires’ (389). </p>
<p>(T. 1344. Ibn Hamid from Salama from Ibn Ishaq from al-Kalbl from <br/>
Abu Salih from Ibn 'Abbas told me that the apostle said to al-'Abbas when <br/>
he was brought to Medina, ‘Redeem yourself, O 'Abbas, and your two <br/>
nephews 'Aqll b. Abu Talib and Naufal b. al-Harith and your ally 'Utba b. <br/>
'Amr b. Jahdam brother of the B. al-Harith b. Fihr, for you are a rich <br/>
man.’ He replied, ‘I was a Muslim but the people compelled me (to fight). <br/>
He answered, ‘God knows best about your Islam. If what you say is true <br/>
God will reward you for it. But to all outward appearance you have been <br/>
against us, so pay us your ransom.’ Now the apostle had taken twenty okes <br/>
of gold from him and he said, ‘O apostle of God, credit me with them in <br/>
my ransom.’ He replied, ‘That has nothing to do with it. God took that <br/>
from you and gave it to us.’ He said, ‘I have no money.’ ‘Then where is <br/>
the money which you left with Ummu’I-FadI d. al-Harith when you left </p>
<p>1 r.t. 1021 for Suhayl’s speech after the death of the prophet. </p>
<p>2 Reading thimdn, The variant thamdnin is Jess likely because dhaud generally means <br/>

<p>The Life of Muhammad 313 </p>
<p>Mecca? You two were alone when you said to her, “If I am killed so much <br/>
is for al-Fadl, 'Abdullah and Qutham and 'Ubaydullah.”’ ‘By him who <br/>
sent you with the truth,’ he exclaimed, ‘none but she and I knew of this <br/>
and now I know that you are God’s apostle.’ So he redeemed himself and <br/>
the three men named above.) 1 </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr told me that Abu Sufyan’s son ‘Amr whom he <br/>
had by a daughter of 'Uqba b. Abu Mu'ayt (390) was a prisoner in the <br/>
apostle’s hands from Badr (391); and when Abu Sufyan was asked to <br/>
ransom his son 'Amr he said, ‘Am I to suffer the double loss of my blood <br/>
and my money? They have killed Hanzala and am I to ransom 'Amr? <br/>
Leave him with them. They can keep him as long as they like!’ </p>
<p>While he was thus held prisoner in Medina with the apostle Sa'd b. al- <br/>
Nu'man b. Akkal, brother of B. 'Amr b. 'Auf, one of the B. Mu'awiya, 464 <br/>
went forth on pilgrimage accompanied by a young wife of his. He was an <br/>
old man and a Muslim who had sheep in al-Naqi'. 2 He left that place on <br/>
pilgrimage without fear of any untoward events, never thinking that he <br/>
would be detained in Mecca, as he came as a pilgrim, for he knew that <br/>
Quraysh did not usually interfere with pilgrims, but treated them well. </p>
<p>But Abu Sufyan fell upon him in Mecca and imprisoned him in retaliation <br/>
for his son 'Amr. Then Abu Sufyan said: </p>
<p>O family of Ibn Akkal, answer his plea </p>
<p>May you lose each other! Do not surrender the chief in his prime. </p>
<p>The Banu 'Amr will be base and contemptible </p>
<p>If they do not release their captive from his fetters. </p>
<p>Hassan b. Thabit answered him: </p>
<p>If Sa'd had been free the day he was in Mecca <br/>
He would have killed many of you ere he was captured. </p>
<p>With a sharp sword or a bow of nab’a wood <br/>
Whose string twangs when the arrow is shot. </p>
<p>The B. 'Amr b. 'Auf went to the apostle and told him the news and <br/>
asked him to give them 'Amr b. Abu Sufyan so that they could let him go <br/>
in exchange for their man and the apostle did so. So they sent him to Abu <br/>
Sufyan and he released Sa'd. </p>
<p>Among the prisoners was Abu’l-'As b. al-Rabi', son-in-law of the apostle, <br/>
married to his daughter Zaynab (392). Abu’l-'As was one of the important <br/>
men of Mecca in wealth, respect, and merchandise. His mother was <br/>
Hala d. Khuwaylid, and Khadlja was his aunt. Khadlja had asked the <br/>
apostle to find him a wife. Now the apostle never opposed her—this was <br/>
before revelation came to him—and so he married him to his daughter. <br/>
Khadlja used to regard him as her son. When God honoured His apostle 465 </p>
<p>1 All writers on the Sira have drawn attention to the passages referring to the capture of <br/>
'Abbas which I.H. omitted. See now the pre-'Abbasid tradition of Musa b. 'Uqba, No. 6. </p>
<p>2 A place near Medina. </p>
<p>314 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>with prophecy Khadija and her daughters believed in him and testified <br/>
that he had brought the truth and followed his religion, though Abu’I-'As <br/>
persisted in his polytheism. Now the apostle had married Ruqayva or <br/>
Umm Kulthum to 'Utba b. Abu Lahab, and when he openly preached to <br/>
Quraysh the command of God and showed them hostility they reminded <br/>
one another that they had relieved Muhammad of his care for his daughters <br/>
and decided to return them so that he should have the responsibility of <br/>
looking after them himself. They went to Abu’1-'As and told him to <br/>
divorce his wife and they would give him any woman he liked. He refused, <br/>
saying that he did not want any other woman from Quraysh; and I have <br/>
heard that the apostle used to speak warmly of his action as a son-in-law. <br/>
Then they went to 'Utba b. Abu Lahab with the same request and he <br/>
said that if they would give him the daughter of Aban b. Sa'Id b. al-'As or <br/>
the daughter of Sa'Id b. al-'As he would divorce his wife, and when they <br/>
did so he divorced her, not having consummated the marriage. Thus God <br/>
took her from him to her honour and his shame, and 'Uthman afterwards <br/>
married her. </p>
<p>Now the apostle had no power of binding and loosing in Mecca, his <br/>
circumstances being circumscribed. Islam had made a division between <br/>
Zaynab and her husband Abu’I-'As, but they lived together, Muslim and <br/>
unbeliever, until the apostle migrated. Abu’I-'As joined the expedition to <br/>
Badr and was captured among the prisoners and remained at Medina with <br/>
the apostle. </p>
<p>Yahya b. 'Abbad b. 'Abdullah b. al-Zubayr from his father 'Abbad told <br/>
me that 'A’isha said: ‘When the Meccans sent to ransom their prisoners, <br/>
Zaynab sent the money for Abu’I-'As; with it she sent a necklace which <br/>
Khadija had given her on her marriage to Abu’I-'As. When the apostle <br/>
466 saw it his feelings overcame him and he said: “If you would like to let her <br/>
have her captive husband back and return her money to her, do so.’’ The <br/>
people at once agreed and they let him go and sent her money back.’ </p>
<p>ZAYNAB SETS OUT FOR MEDINA </p>
<p>Now the apostle had imposed a condition on Abu’I-'As, or the latter had <br/>
undertaken it voluntarily—the facts w r ere never clearly established—that <br/>
he should let Zaynab come to him. At any rate, after Abu’I-'As had <br/>
reached Mecca the apostle sent Zayd b. Haritha and one of the Ansar with <br/>
instructions to stop in the valley of Yajaj 1 until Zaynab passed, and then to <br/>
accompany her back to him. About a month or so after Badr they went off <br/>
to take up their position. Meanwhile Abu’I-'As came to Mecca and told <br/>
Zaynab to rejoin her father, and she went out to make her preparations. </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr told me that he had been told that Zaynab said <br/>
that while she was making her preparations she was met by Hind d. 'Utba <br/>
who inquired whether she was going off to rejoin Muhammad. When she <br/>
1 About 8 miles from Mecca. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 315 </p>
<p>said that she did not wish to go, Hind offered to give her anything she <br/>
needed for the journey as well as money. She need not be shy of her, for <br/>
women stood closer together than men. However, though she thought she <br/>
was sincere she was afraid of her and denied that she had any intention of <br/>
going. But she went on with her preparations. </p>
<p>These completed, her brother-in-law^ Kinana b. al-Rabl' brought her a <br/>
camel and taking his bow he led her aw'ay in a howdah in broad daylight. <br/>
After discussing the matter Quraysh went off in pursuit and overtook <br/>
them in Dhu Tuwa. The first man to come up with them was Habbar b. 467 <br/>
al-Aswad b. al-Muttalib b. Asad b. 'Abdu’l-'Uzza al-Fihrl. He threatened <br/>
her with his lance as she sat in the howdah. It is alleged that the woman <br/>
was pregnant and when she was frightened she had an abortion. Her <br/>
brother-in-law Kinana knelt and emptied his quiver [in front of him] and <br/>
said, ‘By God, if one of you comes near me I will put an arrow through <br/>
him.’ So the men fell back. Then Abu Sufyan with some Quraysh leaders <br/>
came up and asked him to unbend his bow so that they could discuss the <br/>
matter. Then he came up to him and said, ‘You have not done the right <br/>
thing. You have taken the woman out publicly over the heads of the people <br/>
when you know of our misfortune and disaster which Muhammad has <br/>
brought on us. The people will think, if you take away his daughter pub¬ <br/>
licly over the heads of everyone, that that is a sign of our humiliation after <br/>
the disaster that has happened and an exhibition of utter weakness. ’Od’s <br/>
life we don’t want to keep her from her father and that is not our way of <br/>
seeking revenge. But take the woman back, and when the chatter has died <br/>
down and people say that we have brought her back you can take her away <br/>
secretly to rejoin her father.’ This is exactly what happened and one night <br/>
he took her off and delivered her to Zayd b. Haritha and his companion, <br/>
and they took her to the apostle. </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. Rawaha or Abu Khaythama, brother of B. Salim b. 'Auf, <br/>
said of this affair of Zaynab’s (393): </p>
<p>Tidings reached me of their wicked treatment of Zaynab, </p>
<p>So criminal that men could not imagine it. </p>
<p>Muhammad was not put to shame when she was sent forth <br/>
Because of the result of the bloody war between us. </p>
<p>From his alliance with Damdam 1 and his war with us <br/>
Abu Sufyan got but disappointment and remorse. </p>
<p>We bound his son 'Amr and his sworn friend together <br/>
In well-w'rought jangling irons. </p>
<p>I swear we shall never lack soldiers, </p>
<p>Army leaders with many a champion. </p>
<p>Driving before us infidel Quraysh until we subdue them 468 </p>
<p>With a halter above their noses (and) with a branding iron. </p>
<p>We will drive them to the ends of Najd and Nakhla. </p>
<p>1 Cf. p. 428. </p>
<p>3 l6 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>If they drop to the lowland we will pursue them with horse and foot <br/>
So that our road will never deviate. </p>
<p>We will bring upon them the fate of 'Ad and Jurhum. </p>
<p>A people that disobeyed Muhammad will regret it. </p>
<p>And what a time for showing repentance! </p>
<p>Tell Abu Sufyan if you meet him <br/>
‘If you are not sincere in worship, and embrace Islam <br/>
Then shame will come on you speedily in this life <br/>
And in hell you will wear a garment of molten pitch for ever!’ (394) </p>
<p>Abu Sufyan’s ‘sworn friend’ was 'Amir b. al-Hadrami 1 who was among the <br/>
prisoners. Al-Hadrami was an ally of Harb b. Umayya (395). </p>
<p>When those who had gone out to Zaynab returned Hind d. 'Utba met <br/>
them and said: </p>
<p>In peace are you wild asses—rough and coarse </p>
<p>And in war like women in their courses ? </p>
<p>Kinana b. al-Rabl' when he handed Zaynab over to the two men said: </p>
<p>I am astonished at Habbar and the paltry ones of his people <br/>
Who wish me to break my word with Muhammad’s daughter. </p>
<p>I care not for their numbers as long as I live <br/>
And as long as my hand can grasp my trusty blade. </p>
<p>Yazid b. Abu Habib from Bukayr b. 'Abdullah b. al-Ashajj from Sulay- <br/>
man b. Yasar from Abu Ishaq al-DausI from Abu Hurayra, told me that <br/>
the latter said: ‘The apostle sent me among a number of raiders with <br/>
orders that if we got hold of Habbar b. al-Aswad or the other man who <br/>
first got to Zaynab with him (396) we were to burn them with fire. On the <br/>
following day he sent word to us “I told you to burn these two men if you <br/>
got hold of them; then I reflected that none has the right to punish by fire <br/>
save God, so if you capture them kill them.”’ </p>
<p>ABU’l-AS B. AL-RABl' BECOMES a MUSLIM </p>
<p>When Islam thus came between them Abu’l-'As lived in Mecca while <br/>
Zaynab lived in Medina with the apostle until, shortly before the con¬ <br/>
quest, 2 Abu’l-'As went to Syria trading with his own money and that of <br/>
Quraysh which they entrusted to him, for he was a trustworthy man. <br/>
Having completed his business he was on his way home when one of the <br/>
apostle’s raiding parties fell in with him and took all he had, though he <br/>
himself escaped them. W hen the raiders went off with their plunder Abu’l- <br/>
'As went into Zaynab’s house under cover of night and asked her to give <br/>
him protection. She at once did so. He came to ask for his property. <br/>
When the apostle went out to morning prayer—soYazId b. Ruman told me </p>
<p>1 Cf. p. 442. </p>
<p>3 sc. of Mecca. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 317 </p>
<p>—and said ‘Allah akbar’ followed by all present, Zaynab cried from the <br/>
place where the women sat ‘O you men, I have given protection to Abu’l- <br/>
'As b. al-Rabl'.’ 1 His prayers over, the apostle turned round to face the men <br/>
and asked them if they had heard what he had heard, and when they said <br/>
that they had he swore that he knew nothing about the matter until <br/>
Zaynab made her declaration, adding, ‘the meanest Muslim can give <br/>
protection on their behalf’. He went off to see his daughter and told her <br/>
to honour her guest but not to allow him to approach her for she was not <br/>
lawful to him. </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr told me that the apostle sent to the raiding party <br/>
which had taken Abu’l-'As’s goods saying: ‘This man is related to us as <br/>
you know and you have taken property of his. If you think well to restore <br/>
it to him we should like that; but if you will not it is booty which God has <br/>
given you and you have the better right to it.’ They replied that they 470 <br/>
would willingly give it back and they were so scrupulous that men brought <br/>
back old skins and little leather bottles and even a little piece of wood until <br/>
everything was returned and nothing withheld. Then Abu’l-'As went to <br/>
Mecca and paid everyone what was due, including those who had given <br/>
him money to lay out on their behalf, and asked them if anyone of them <br/>
had any further claim on him, ‘No,’ they said, ‘God reward you; we have <br/>
found you both trustworthy and generous.’ ‘Then’, said he, ‘I bear witness <br/>
that there is no God but the God and that Muhammad is his servant and <br/>
his apostle. I would have become a Muslim when I was with him but that <br/>
I feared that you would think that I only wanted to rob you of your <br/>
property; and now that God has restored it to you and I am clear of it I <br/>
submit myself to God.’ Thus saying he went off to rejoin the apostle. </p>
<p>Dawud b. al-Husayn from 'Ikrima from b. 'Abbas told me that the <br/>
apostle restored Zaynab to him according to the first marriage <em>after six <br/>
years had passed</em> without any new procedure (397). </p>
<p>Among the prisoners who, I was told, were given their freedom without <br/>
having to pay ransom were: Abu’l-'As whom the prophet freed after Zaynab <br/>
his daughter had sent his ransom; al-Muttalib b. Hantab b. al-Harith b. <br/>
'Ubayda b. 'Umar b. Makhzum who belonged [by capture] to some of <br/>
B. al-Harith b. al-Khazraj (He was left in their hands until they let him <br/>
go, and he went to his people.) (398); Sayfl b. Abu Rifa'a b. 'Abid b. 471 <br/>
'Abdullah b. 'Umar b. Makhzum. (He was left in the hands of his captors <br/>
and when no one came to ransom him they let him go on condition that <br/>
he should send his ransom, but he broke his word to them. Hassan b. <br/>
Thabit said in reference to that: </p>
<p>Sayfi is not the man to fulfil his pledge </p>
<p>The back of a fox tired at some waterhole or other; 2 </p>
<p>and Abu 'Azza 'Amr b. 'Abdullah b. 'Uthman b. Uhayb b. Hudhafa b. </p>

<p>Jumah. He was a poor man whose family consisted of daughters, and he <br/>
said to the apostle: ‘You know that I have no money, and am in real need <br/>
with a large family, so let me go without ransom.’ The apostle did so on <br/>
condition that he should not fight against him again. Praising him and <br/>
mentioning his kindness among his people Abu 'Azza said: </p>
<p>Who will tell the apostle Muhammad from me <br/>
You are true and the divine King is to be praised? </p>
<p>You call men to truth and right guidance, </p>
<p>God himself witnesses to you. </p>
<p>You are a man given a place among us <br/>
To which there are steps hard and easy. </p>
<p>Those who fight you die miserably, </p>
<p>Those who make peace live happily. </p>
<p>When I am reminded of Badr and its people <br/>
Sorrow and a sense of loss come over me (399). 1 </p>
<p>'UMAYR B. WAHB BECOMES A MUSLIM </p>
<p>Muhammad b. Ja'far b. al-Zubayr from ‘Urwa b. al-Zubayr told me that <br/>
'Umayr was sitting with Safwan b. Umayya in the hijr shortly after Badr. </p>
<p>472 Now 'Umayr was one of the leaders of Quraysh who used to molest the <br/>
apostle and his companions and cause them distress while he was in <br/>
Mecca, and his son Wahb was among the prisoners taken at Badr (400). <br/>
He mentioned those who were thrown into the well and Safwan said, ‘By <br/>
God, there is no good in life now they are dead.’ ‘You are right,’ said <br/>
'Umayr, ‘were it not for a debt outstanding against me which I cannot pay <br/>
and a family I cannot afford to leave unprovided for, I would ride to <br/>
Muhammad and kill him, for I have good cause against the lot of them, my <br/>
son being a prisoner in their hands.’ Safwan took him up and said: ‘I will <br/>
discharge your debt and take care of your family with my own so long as <br/>
they live. All that I have shall be theirs.’ ‘Umayr and he agreed to keep <br/>
the matter secret. </p>
<p>Then 'Umayr called for his sword and sharpened it and smeared it with <br/>
poison and went off to Medina. While 'Umar was talking with some of the <br/>
Muslims about Badr and mentioning how God had honoured them in <br/>
giving them victory over their enemies he suddenly saw ‘Umayr stopping <br/>
at the door of the mosque girt with his sword, and said, ‘This dog the <br/>
enemy of God is 'Umayr b. Wahb. By God he’s come for some evil <br/>
purpose. It was he who made mischief among us and calculated our <br/>
numbers for the enemy at Badr.’ Then ‘Umar went into the apostle and <br/>
said, ‘O prophet of God, this enemy of God 'Umayr b. Wahb has come <br/>
girt with his sword.’ He told him to let him come in and 'Umar advanced </p>
<p>1 I prefer the reading fuqudu to qu’udu. This is perhaps the most blatant forgery of all <br/>
the ‘poems’ of the Sira. The heathen author’s record was so bad that the prophet ordered <br/>
his execution and yet he is made to utter fulsome praise of him and devotion to Islam. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>and seizing his bandoleer he gripped him round the neck with it. He told <br/>
the Ansar who were with him to come in and sit with the apostle and to <br/>
watch the rascal carefully, for he was not to be trusted. When the apostle <br/>
saw 'Umayr and 'Umar grasping the bandoleer round his neck he told <br/>
Umar to let go and 'Umayr to advance. He came up and said 'Good <br/>
morning’, for that was the greeting of paganism. The apostle said, ‘God 473 <br/>
has honoured us with a better greeting than thine, 'Umayr. It is Salam, <br/>
the greeting of the inhabitants of Paradise.’ ‘By God, Muhammad, you <br/>
have taken to it only recently.’ 1 ‘What brought you ?’ ‘I have come about <br/>
this prisoner you have that you may treat him well.’ ‘Then why have you <br/>
a sword round your neckr' ‘God damn the swords. Have they done us <br/>
any good? Tell me the truth. Why have you come?’ ‘I came only for <br/>
the reason I have told you.’ ‘Nay, but you and Safwan b. Umayya sat <br/>
together in the hijr and talked about the Quraysh who were thrown into <br/>
the well. Then you said “But for debts and family reasons I would go and <br/>
kill Muhammad.” And Safwan assumed responsibility for both if you <br/>
would kill me for him, but God intervened.’ ‘I testify that you are "the <br/>
apostle of God. We used to call you a liar when you brought us tidings <br/>
from heaven and we denied the revelation you brought. But this is a <br/>
matter to which only 1 and Safwan were privy, and none can have told you <br/>
of it but God. Praise be to God who has guided me to Islam and led me <br/>
thus.’ Then he testified to the truth and the apostle said, ‘Instruct your <br/>
brother in his religion, read the Quran to him, and free his prisoner for <br/>
him,’ and they did so. </p>
<p>I hen he said, ‘I used to be active in extinguishing the light of God and <br/>
in persecuting those who followed God’s religion. I should like you to <br/>
give me permission to go to Mecca to summon them to God and His <br/>
apostle and to Islam that perhaps God may guide them; and if not I will <br/>
persecute them in their religion as I used to persecute your companions.’ </p>
<p>The apostle agreed and hei went to Mecca. When 'Umayr had left, Safwan <br/>
was saying, ‘You will soon have some good news which will make you <br/>
forget what happened at Badr.’ Safwan kept questioning riders until one <br/>
came who told him of 'Umayr’s Islam, and he swore that he would never <br/>
speak to him again nor do him a service. When 'Umayr came to Mecca he <br/>
stayed there summoning people to Islam and treating those who opposed <br/>
him violently so that through him many became Muslims. 474 </p>
<p>I was told that it was cither Umayr or al-Harith b. Hisham who saw the <br/>
devil when he turned on his heels on the day of Badr and said, ‘Where are <br/>
you going, O Suraqa?’ And the enemy of God lay on the ground and dis¬ <br/>
appeared. 2 So God sent down concerning him, ‘And when Satan made <br/>
their works seem good to them and said None can conquer you today for I <br/>
am your protector 3 and he mentions how r the devil deceived them and took </p>
<p>1 Reading Kunta for C, and W.’s Kuntu, but perhaps the meaning is ‘It is new to me’. <br/>
z In another tradition quoted by Suhayli ii. 85 it is the devil who knocks down al-Hanth. </p>
<p>3 Sura 8. 50. </p>
<p>320 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>the form of Suraqa b. Malik b. Ju'shum when they remembered the quarrel <br/>
they had with B. Bakr. God said, ‘And when the two armies saw each <br/>
other’ and the enemy of God saw the armies of angels by which God <br/>
strengthened His apostle and the believers against their enemies ‘he turned <br/>
on his heels and said, “I am quit of you, for I see what you do not see.” <br/>
The enemy of God spoke the truth for he did see what they could not see <br/>
and said, “I fear God for God is severe in punishment.”’ I was told that <br/>
they used to see him in every camp whenever he appeared in the form of <br/>
Suraqa not suspecting him until on the day of Badr when the two armies <br/>
met he turned on his heels and betrayed them after he had led them on <br/>
(401). </p>
<p>Hassan b. Thabit said: </p>
<p>My people it was who sheltered their prophet </p>
<p>And believed in him when all the world were unbelievers, </p>
<p>Except a chosen few who were forerunners <br/>
To the righteous, helpers with the Helpers. </p>
<p>Rejoicing in God’s portion </p>
<p>Saying when he came to them, noble of race, chosen, </p>
<p>Welcome in safety and comfort, </p>
<p>Goodly the prophet the portion and the guest. </p>
<p>They gave him a home in which a guest of theirs <br/>
Need have no fear—an (ideal) home. </p>
<p>They shared their wealth when the refugees came <br/>
While the share of the stubborn opponent is hell. </p>
<p>475 To Badr we went—they to their death. </p>
<p>Had they known what they should have known they would not have <br/>
gone; </p>
<p>The devil deluded and then betrayed them. </p>
<p>Thus does the evil one deceive his friends. </p>
<p>He said I am your protector and brought them to an evil pass <br/>
Wherein is shame and disgrace. </p>
<p>Then when we fought them they deserted their leaders, </p>
<p>Some fleeing to high ground others to the plain (402). </p>

<p>THE COMING DOWN OF THE SURA ANFAL 1 476 </p>
<p>When Badr was over, God sent down the whole Sura Anfal about it. With <br/>
regard to their quarrelling about the spoils there came down: ‘They will <br/>
ask you about the spoils, say, the spoils belong to God and the apostle, so <br/>
fear God and be at peace with one another, and obey God and His apostle <br/>
if you are believers.’ </p>
<p>'Ubada b. al-Samit, so I have heard, when he was asked about this sura <br/>
said: ‘It came down about us, the people of Badr, when we quarrelled <br/>
about the booty on that day, and God took it out of our hands when we <br/>
showed an evil disposition and gave it to the apostle, who divided it equally <br/>
among us. In that there was the fear of God, and obedience to Him and to <br/>
His apostle, and peace among us.’ </p>
<p>Then He mentions the army, and their journey with the apostle when 1 <br/>
they knew that Quraysh had come out against them, and they had only <br/>
gone out making for the caravan because they wanted booty, and He said, </p>
<p>‘As thy Lord brought thee out of thy house in truth when a part of the <br/>
believers were un-willing, they disputed with thee about the truth after it <br/>
had become plain, as though they were being driven to their death while <br/>
they looked on.’ i.e. Unwilling to meet the army and disliking to confront <br/>
Quraysh when they w r ere told of them. </p>
<p>‘And when God promised you that one of the parties should be yours, and <br/>
you wanted to have the one that was not armed.’ i.e. Booty and not war. </p>
<p>‘And God wanted to establish the truth by His words, and to cut off the 477 <br/>
uttermost part of the unbelievers.’ i.e. By the disaster which He brought <br/>
upon the chiefs and leaders of Quraysh on the day of Badr. </p>
<p>‘When you asked your Lord for help.’ i.e. Their prayers when they <br/>
looked at the multitude of their enemies and their own small numbers. </p>
<p>‘And He answered you.’ i.e. The prayer of His apostle and your prayers. </p>
<p>‘I will reinforce you with a thousand angels, one behind another. When <br/>
He made you slumber as a reassurance from Him.’ i.e. I sent down reassur¬ <br/>
ance upon you when you slumbered unafraid. </p>
<p>‘And He sent down water from heaven upon you.’ i.e. The rain that <br/>
came upon them that night and prevented the polytheists from getting to <br/>
the water first, and left the way clear to the Muslims. </p>
<p>‘That He might cleanse you by it, and take from you the impurity of <br/>
Satan, and strengthen your hearts, and confirm your steps.’ i.e. To take <br/>
from you the doubt of Satan when he made them afraid of the enemy, and <br/>
the hardening of the ground for them so that they got to their halting-place <br/>
before the enemy arrived. </p>
<p>B 4090 </p>
<p>Sura 8. <br/>
Y </p>
<p>322 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Then God said, ‘Then thy Lord revealed to the angels, I am with you so <br/>
strengthen those that believe.’ i.e. help those that believe. </p>
<p>‘I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve, so strike off <br/>
their heads and cut off all their fingers, because they opposed God and His <br/>
apostle and he who opposes God and His apostle (will find) God severe <br/>
in punishment.’ </p>
<p>Then He said, ‘O you who believe, when you meet those who disbelieve <br/>
on the march, do not turn your backs. He who turns his back except in <br/>
manoeuvring or intending to join another section, incurs the wrath of God, <br/>
and his destination is Hell, a miserable end.’ i.e. Inciting them against <br/>
their enemy so that they should not withdraw from them when they met <br/>
them, God having promised what He had promised. </p>
<p>Then God said concerning the apostle’s throwing pebbles at them, <br/>
‘When you threw, it was not you that threw, but God.’ i.e. Your throwing <br/>
would have had no effect unless God had helped you therein and cast <br/>
terror into their hearts when He put them to flight. </p>
<p>‘And to test the believers with a good test.’ i.e. To let them know of His <br/>
favour towards them in giving them victory over their enemies in spite of <br/>
their small number that they might know thereby His truth, and be thank¬ <br/>
ful for His favour. </p>
<p>Then He said, ‘If you sought a judgement, a judgement came to you.’ <br/>
i.e. With reference to what Abu Jahl said, ‘O God, he who is the worst in <br/>
severing relations and bringing us things that are unacceptable destroy him <br/>
this morning.’ 1 Istiftdh means to pray for what is just. </p>
<p>God said, ‘If you cease,’ that is addressed to Quraysh, ‘it is better for <br/>
you, and if you return (to the attack) We will return.’ i.e. With a similar <br/>
blow to that which We gave you on the day of Badr. </p>
<p>‘And your army will avail you nothing how’ever numerous, and (know) <br/>
that God is with the believers.’ i.e. That your number and multitude will <br/>
not avail you at all while I am with the believers, helping them against <br/>
those that oppose them. </p>
<p>Then God said, ‘O you that believe, obey God and His apostle, turn not <br/>
away from him while you are listening.’ i.e. Do not contradict his orders <br/>
when you hear him speak and while you assert that you are on his side. </p>
<p>‘And be not like those who said, “We hear’’ when they did not hear.’ <br/>
i.e. Like the hypocrites who pretend to be obedient and are secretly dis¬ <br/>
obedient to him. </p>
<p>‘The worst of beasts with God are the deaf and the dumb who do not <br/>
understand.’ i.e. The hypocrites whom I have forbidden you to imitate. <br/>
Dumb in reference to good, deaf to truth, not understanding and not know¬ <br/>
ing the vengeance and consequence which will come upon them. </p>
<p>‘Had God known that there was good among them, He would have made <br/>
them listen.’ i.e. In performing for them the words which they spoke with <br/>
their tongues, but their hearts contradicted them, and if they had come </p>
<p>1 v.s. W. 445 med. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 323 </p>
<p>forth with you, ‘they would have turned their backs, going aside.’ i.e. Would <br/>
not have been faithful to you in the purpose for which they had come out. </p>
<p>‘O you who believe, respond to God and the apostle when he summons <br/>
you to that which will quicken you,’ i.e. to the war in which God exalted <br/>
you after humiliation, and made you strong after weakness, and protected <br/>
you from your enemies after you had been overcome by them. </p>
<p>‘And remember when you were few, despised in the land, fearing that <br/>
men would pluck you away, and He gave you refuge and strengthened you <br/>
by His help and nourished you with good things that you might be thank¬ <br/>
ful. 0 you who believe, betray not God and His apostle and betray not <br/>
your trust knowingly.’ i.e. Do not show Him what is right, which pleases <br/>
Him, and then oppose Him secretly in something else, for that is destroying <br/>
your trust and treachery to yourselves. </p>
<p>‘O you who believe, fear God and He will make for you a furqan , 1 and 479 <br/>
wipe away your evil acts and pardon you. od is exceeding bountiful.’ i.e. </p>
<p>A distinction between true and false by which God shows your truth and <br/>
extinguishes the falsehood of those who oppose you. </p>
<p>Then He reminds the apostle of His favour towards him when the people <br/>
plotted against him ‘to kill him, or to wound him, or to drive him out; and <br/>
they plotted and God plotted, and God is the best of plotters.’ i.e. I <br/>
deceived them with My firm guile so that I delivered you from them. </p>
<p>Then He mentions the folly of Quraysh in asking for a judgement <br/>
against themselves when they said, ‘O God, if this is the truth from Thee,’ <br/>
i.e. what Muhammad has brought, ‘then rain upon us stones from heaven.’ <br/>
i.e. As you rained them upon the people of Lot. </p>
<p>‘Or bring us a painful punishment.’ i.e. Some of that by which You <br/>
punished the peoples before us. </p>
<p>They used to say, God will not punish us when we ask for His pardon, <br/>
and He will not punish a people whose prophet is with them until He has <br/>
sent him away from them. That is what they said when the apostle was <br/>
among them, and God said to His apostle, mentioning their ignorance and <br/>
folly and the judgement they asked against themselves when He reproached <br/>
them with their evil deeds. ‘God will not punish them while you are with <br/>
them, and God will not punish them while they ask for forgiveness.’ i.e. <br/>
When they said, ‘We ask for forgiveness and Muhammad is among us.’ </p>
<p>Then He said, ‘What (plea) have they that God should not punish them ?’ <br/>
though you are among them and though they ask for forgiveness as they say. </p>
<p>1 I.I.’s explanation of the meaning of furqan is adopted by Tabari on 2. 50 and it admir¬ <br/>
ably suits the sense of the verb in Arabic; but Baydawi on 21. 49 and Zamakhshari on 8, 29 <br/>
(this verse) collect a number of meanings. If the word were purely Arabic, it would be <br/>
difficult to see why there was any doubt about it. The facts are that in Aramaic furqan means <br/>
‘deliverance’, and in Christian Aramaic it is the common word for ‘salvation’. In the Quran <br/>
it often means, or seems to mean, some sort of book, 2. 50; 3. 2; and 2r. 49, &amp;c., but in <br/>
8. 42 (1 hi.) ‘The day of the furqan, the day when the two hosts met', ‘deliverance’ seems to <br/>
be the most probable meaning, and the same would seem to apply to this verse. For an <br/>
illuminating discussion of the evidence and theories formed thereon see Jeffery, Foreign <br/>
Vocabulary, 225-9. </p>
<p>324 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>‘While they bar the way to the sacred mosque.’ i.e. Against those who <br/>
believe in God and His servant, i.e. You and those who iollow you. </p>
<p>‘And they are not its guardians, its guardians are only the God-fearers,’ <br/>
who observe its sanctity and perform prayer by it. i.e. You and those who <br/>
believe in you. </p>
<p>‘But most of them do not know and their prayer at the temple,’ i.e. By <br/>
which they assert that evil is kept from them, ‘Is nothing but whistling and <br/>
clapping of hands’ (405). </p>
<p>480 And that is what God does not approve of and does not like and what <br/>
they were not ordered to do. </p>
<p>‘So taste the punishment for what you'are disbelieving.’ i.e. When He <br/>
brought death upon-them at the battle of Badr. </p>
<p>Yahya b. ‘Abbad b. ‘Abdullah b. al-Zubayr from his father 'Abbad from <br/>
‘A’isha, who said that only a little time elapsed between the coming down <br/>
of ‘O thou that art enwrapt’ 1 and the word of God about it, Leave Me to <br/>
deal with the liars living at ease, and let them alone for a little. We have <br/>
fetters and fire and food which chokes, and a painful punishment, until <br/>
God smote Quraysh on the day of Badr (406). </p>
<p>Then God said, </p>
<p>‘Those who disbelieve, spending their wealth to keep men from the way <br/>
of God will expend it, then they will suffer loss, then they will be over¬ <br/>
come, and those who disbelieve will be gathered to Hell. He means those <br/>
who went to Abu Sufyan and to everyone of the Quraysh who had money <br/>
in that merchandise, and asked them to help them with it in the war <br/>
against the apostle, and they did so. </p>
<p>Then He said, ‘Say to those who disbelieve, if they cease, they will be <br/>
pardoned for what is passed, and if they return’, to fight you, the example <br/>
of the ringleaders has been made.’ 2 i.e. those who were killed at Badr. </p>
<p>Then He said, ‘Fight them so that there is no more persecution, 3 and <br/>
religion, all of it, shall belong to God.’ i.e. So that no believer is persecuted <br/>
from his religion, and monotheism may be pure, God having no partner <br/>
and no rivals. </p>
<p>‘If they ce&amp;se, then God sees what they do, and if they turn away,’ from <br/>
481 thy commandment to their unbelief, ‘then know that God is your friend , <br/>
who glorified vou and helped you against them on the day of Badr in spite <br/>
of their great numbers and your small force. </p>
<p>‘A fine friend, and a fine helper.’ </p>
<p>Then He taught them how to divide the spoil and His judgement about <br/>
it when He made it lawful to them and said: ‘And know that what you take <br/>
as booty a fifth belongs to God and the apostle and next of kin and orphans <br/>
and the poor and the wayfarer, if you believe in God and what W e sent <br/>
down to Our servant on the day of furqan, the day the two armies met; and </p>
<p>1 Sura 73. 1 and 1 r-14. </p>
<p>2 Normally awtvalin would mean 'the men of old’. </p>
<p>3 fitna. This word contains the ideas of painful trial, rebellion, and seduction. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 325 </p>
<p>God is able to do all things,’ i.e. the day I divided between the true and the <br/>
false by My power the day the two armies met—you and they ‘when you <br/>
were on the nearer side’ of the wadi ‘and they on the further side’ of the <br/>
wadi towards Mecca ‘and the caravan was below you,’ i.e. the caravan of <br/>
Abu Sufyan which you had gone out to capture and they had gone out to <br/>
protect without any appointment between you. ‘And if you had arranged <br/>
to meet you would have failed to meet,’ i.e. had you arranged to meet and <br/>
then you had heard of their multitude compared with your force you would <br/>
not have met them; but that God might accomplish a thing that had to <br/>
be done,’ i.e. that He might accomplish what He willed in His power, <br/>
namely to exalt Islam and its followers and to abase the unbelievers without <br/>
your fighting hard. He did w r hat He willed in His goodness. Then He <br/>
said: that he who died should die with a clear proof and he who lived <br/>
should live by a clear proof. God is a Hearer, a Knower, ’ i.e. that he who <br/>
disbelieved should disbelieve after the proof in the sign and example which <br/>
he had seen and he who believed should believe by the same warrant. </p>
<p>Then He mentioned His kindness and His plotting for him: ‘When God <br/>
showed thee in thy sleep that they were few, and if He had shown them to <br/>
thee as many you would have failed and quarrelled over the affair; but God <br/>
saved you. He knows what is within the breasts.’ What God showed him <br/>
was one of His favours by which He encouraged them against their enemy, <br/>
and kept from them what would have frightened them because of their <br/>
weakness, because He knew what was in them (407). ‘And when you met <br/>
them He made you see them as few 7 making you seem small in their eyes <br/>
that God might accomplish a thing that had to be done,’ i.e. to unite them <br/>
for war to take vengeance on whom He willed and to show favour to those <br/>
Whom He willed so to bless, who were of the number of His friends. 482 <br/>
Then He admonished and instructed and taught them how they ought <br/>
to conduct their wars and said: ‘O believers, w'hen you meet an armv’ whom <br/>
you fight in the way of God ‘Stand, firm and remember God often’ to <br/>
Whom you devoted yourselves w'hen you gave your allegiance to Him ‘so <br/>
that you may prosper. And obey God and His apostle and wrangle not lest <br/>
you fail,’ i.e. do not quarrel so that your affairs become disordered ‘and <br/>
your spirit depart,’ i.e. your bravery go, ‘and be steadfast. God is with <br/>
the steadfast,’ i.e. I am with you when you do that. ‘And be not like those <br/>
who went forth from their houses boastfully to be seen of men,’ i.e. do not <br/>
be like Abu Jahl and his companions who said, ‘We will not go back until <br/>
we have been to Badr and slaughtered camels there and drunk w'ine and <br/>
the singing girls have made music for us and the Arabs will hear of it,’ i.e. <br/>
let not your affair be outw T ard show and the subject of gossip, nor con¬ <br/>
cerned with men, and purify your intention towards God and your efforts <br/>
for the victory of your religion and the help of your prophet. Simply do <br/>
that and do not aim at anything else. Then He said: ‘And when Satan <br/>
made their deeds seem good to them and said, ‘hlo man can conquer you <br/>
today for I am your protector”’ (408). </p>
<p>326 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Then God mentions the unbelievers and what they will meet when they <br/>
die, and describes them, and tells His prophet about them until He says: <br/>
‘If you come upon them in war, deal with them so forcibly as to terrify <br/>
those who follow' them, haply they may take warning,’ i.e. make a severe <br/>
example of them to those that come after, that haply they may understand, <br/>
‘And prepare what strength you can against them, and cavalry by whicfy <br/>
you may strike terror into the enemy of God and your enemy’ as far as His <br/>
words, ‘And whatever you spend in the way of God will be repaid to you: <br/>
you will not be w'ronged,’ i.e. you will not lose your rew'ard with God in <br/>
the next life and a rapid recompense in this world. Then He said, ‘And if <br/>
they incline to peace incline thou to it,’ i.e. if they ask you for peace on the <br/>
basis of Islam then make peace on that basis, ‘and rely on God,’ verily </p>
<p>483 God will suffice thee, ‘He is the Hearer, the Knower’ (409). ‘And if they <br/>
would deceive thee, God is sufficient for thee,’ He being behind thee, ‘He <br/>
it is w r ho strengthens thee with His help’ after weakness ‘and by the be¬ <br/>
lievers. And He made them of one mind’ by the guidance with which God <br/>
sent thee to them. ‘Hadst thou spent all the world’s wealth thou hadst not <br/>
made them of one mind but God made them of one mind’ by His religion <br/>
to which He gathered them. ‘He is mighty, wise.’ </p>
<p>Then He said: ‘O prophet, God is sufficient for thee and the believers <br/>
who follow' thee, O prophet, exhort the believers to fight. If there are <br/>
twenty steadfast ones among you they will overcome tw'o hundred, and if <br/>
there are a hundred of you they will overcome a thousand unbelievers for <br/>
they are a senseless people,’ i.e. they do not fight with a good intention nor <br/>
for truth nor have they knowledge of what is good and what is evil. </p>
<p>484 ‘Abdullah b. Abu Najlh from *Ata’ b. Abu Ribah from ‘Abdullah b. <br/>
‘Abbas told me that when this verse came dowm it came as a shock to the <br/>
Muslims who took it hard that twenty should have to fight two hundred, <br/>
and a hundred fight a thousand. So God relieved them and cancelled the <br/>
verse with another saying: ‘Now' has God relieved you and He knows that <br/>
there is weakness amongst you, so if there are a hundred steadfast they <br/>
shall overcome tw r o hundred, and if there are a thousand of you they shall <br/>
overcome two thousand by God’s permission, for God is wfith the stead¬ <br/>
fast.’ (‘Abdullah) said, ‘When they numbered half of the enemy it was <br/>
wrong for them to run from them; but if they were less than half they <br/>
w'ere not bound to fight and it w'as permissible for them to withdraw.’ </p>
<p>Then God reproached him about the prisoners and the taking of booty, <br/>
no other prophet before him having taken booty from his enemy. Muham¬ <br/>
mad Abu Ja'far b. ‘All b. al-Husayn told me that the apostle said: ‘I was <br/>
helped by fear; the earth w'as made a place to pray, and clean; I was given <br/>
all-embracing words; booty w'as made lawful to me as to no prophet <br/>
before me; and I was given the power to intercede; five privileges accorded <br/>
to no prophet before me.* </p>
<p>God said, ‘It is not for any prophet,’ i.e. before thee, ‘to take prisoners’ <br/>
from his enemies ‘until he has made slaughter in the earth,’ i.e. slaughtered </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 327 </p>
<p>his enemies until he drives them from the land. 1 ‘You desire the lure of <br/>
this world,’ i.e: its goods, the ransom of the captives. ‘But God desires the <br/>
next world,’ i.e. their killing them to manifest the religion w'hich He wishes <br/>
to manifest and by which the next world may be attained, ‘Had there not <br/>
previously been a book from God there would have come upon you for <br/>
what you took,’ i.e. prisoners and booty, ‘an aw'ful punishment,’ i.e. had it <br/>
not previously gone forth from Me that I would punish only after a prohibi¬ <br/>
tion—and He had not prohibited them—I w'ould have punished you for <br/>
what you did. Then He made it law'ful to him and to them as a mercy from <br/>
Him and a gift from the Compassionate, the Merciful. He said, ‘So enjoy <br/>
what you have captured as lawful and good, and fear God. God is For¬ <br/>
giving, Merciful.’ Then He said: ‘O prophet, Say to those captives in <br/>
your hands, If God knows any good in your hearts He will give you some¬ <br/>
thing better than that which has been taken from you and God wall pardon <br/>
you. God is Forgiving, Merciful.’ </p>
<p>He incited the Muslims to unity and made the Refugees and the Helpers 485 <br/>
friends in religion and the unbelievers friends one of another. Then He <br/>
said: ‘If you do not do so, there will be confusion in the land and a great <br/>
corruption,’ i.e. unless believer becomes friend of believer to the exclusion <br/>
of the unbeliever even though he is of his kin. ‘There will be confusion in <br/>
the land,’ i.e. doubt about the true and the false and the rise of corruption <br/>
in the land if the believer takes the side of the unbeliever against the <br/>
believer. </p>
<p>Then He assigned inheritances to next of kin of those who became <br/>
Muslims after the friendship between Refugees and Helpers and said: ‘And <br/>

Ibn Ishaq goes on to say this is improbable, and in view of what 4 ’ (1357) reports from him <br/>
via Salama impossible: when the words ‘it is not for any prophet, &amp;c.’ came down the apostle <br/>
said, If punishment had come down from heaven, none would escape it but Sa'd b. Mu’adh <br/>
because he said, ‘I would rather be slaughtered in battle than be spared to live among men.’ </p>

43, whereas only 42 are named, it is obvious that he must have included ‘Abbas among the <br/>
psisoners. I.H.’s note is that one prisoner, whose name is not mentionedyis missing from <br/>
the list. </p>

<p>516 SOME POETRY ABOUT THE BATTLE OF BADR </p>
<p>Of the poetry about the battle of Badr which the two parties bandied <br/>
between them in reference to what happened therein are the lines of <br/>
liamza b. 'Abdu’l-Mutfalib (537): </p>
<p>Surely one of time’s wonders 1 <br/>
(Though roads to death are plain to see) </p>
<p>Is that a people should destroy themselves and perish 2 <br/>
By encouraging one another to disobedience and disbelief. </p>
<p>The night they all set out for Badr <br/>
And became death’s pawns in its well. </p>
<p>We had sought but their caravan, naught else, </p>
<p>But they came to us and we met unexpectedly. 3 <br/>
When we met there was no way out </p>
<p>Save with a thrust from dun-coloured straight-fashioned shafts <br/>
And a blow with swords which severed their heads, </p>
<p>Swords that glittered as they smote. </p>
<p>We left the erring 'Utba lying dead </p>
<p>And Shayba among the slain thrown in the w r ell; </p>
<p>‘Amr lay dead among their protectors </p>
<p>And the keening women rent their garments for him, </p>
<p>The noble women of Lu’ayy b. Ghalib <br/>
Who surpass the best of Fihr. </p>
<p>Those were folk who were killed in their error <br/>
And they left a banner not prepared for victory— </p>
<p>A banner of error whose people Iblis led. </p>
<p>He betrayed them (the evil one is prone to treachery). </p>
<p>When he saw things clearly he said to them, </p>
<p>‘I am quit of you. I can no longer endure, 4 <br/>
I see what you do not see, I fear God’s punishment <br/>
For He is invincible.’ </p>
<p>He led them to death so that they perished <br/>
While he knew what they could not know. </p>
<p>On the day of the well they mustered a thousand, </p>
<p>We three hundred like excited white stallions. </p>
<p>With us were God’s armies when He reinforced us with them <br/>
In a place that will ever be renowned. </p>
<p>5 J 7 Under our banner Gabriel attacked with them <br/>
In the fray where they met their death. </p>
<p>1 Lit. Did you see a thing that wa9 one of time’s wonders ? </p>

poem attributed to Hassan. Cf. W. 475, line z. </p>

<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Al-Harith b. Hisham b. al-Mughira answered them thus: </p>
<p>Help, O my people, in my longing and loss <br/>
My sorrow and burning heart! </p>
<p>Tears flow copiously from my eyes </p>
<p>“ ng fr ° m the COrd of the woman who strings them <br/>
Weeping for the swect-natured hero S ’ </p>

<p>Well timeT L ^. K y ° U when your luck out, <br/>
well, time is bound to bring its changes. </p>
<p>In past times which are gone </p>
<p>You brought upon them a humiliation which is hard to bear. </p>
<p>less I die I shall not leave you unavenged. </p>
<p>I will spare neither brother nor wife’s kin. </p>
<p>I will slay as many dear to them <br/>
As they have slain of mine. </p>
<p>Have strangers whom they have collected deceived them <br/>
While we are the pure stock of Fihr? </p>
<p>Help, O Lu’ayy, protect your sanctuary and your gods* </p>
<p>Give them not up to the evil man! 1 </p>
<p>“ W andTurt n am yOU "" ** </p>
<p>Why did the reprobate want to destroy you ?3 <br/>
Forgive him not, O tribe of Ghalib, </p>
<p>Fight your adversary with all your might and help one another <br/>
Bear one another s afflictions with endurance. </p>
<p>1 ou may well avenge your brother </p>
<p>Nothing matters if you fail to take revenge on 'Amr’s slayers. </p>
<p>1 h waving swords flashing in your hands like lightning <br/>
bending heads flying as they glitter. ® </p>
<p>As it were the tracks of ants on their blades </p>
<p>When they are unsheathed against the evil-eyed enemy (538). </p>
<p>Alf b. Abu Talib said: </p>
<p>Have you not seen how God favoured His apostle <br/>
With the favour of a strong, powerful, and gracious one- <br/>
How He brought humiliation on the unbelievers <br/>
Who were put to shame in captivity and death <br/>
Wflule the apostle of God’s victory was glorious <br/>
He being sent by God in righteousness. </p>
<p>He brought the Furqan sent down from God, </p>
<p>3 Reading dhamim or laim for halm in the text. </p>
<p>342 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Its signs 1 are plain to men of sense. </p>
<p>Some firmly believed in that and were convinced <br/>
And (thanks to God) became one people; 2 <br/>
Others disbelieved, their minds went astray </p>
<p>And the Lord of the throne brought repeated calamities upon them; <br/>
At Badr He gave them into the pow r er of His apostle <br/>
And an angry army who did valiantly. </p>
<p>They smote them with their trusty swords, </p>
<p>Furbished well, and polished. </p>
<p>How many a lusty youngster, </p>
<p>Many a hardy warrior did they leave prone. </p>
<p>Their keening women spent a sleepless night, </p>
<p>Their tears now strong, now weak. </p>
<p>They keen for erring 'Utba and his son, </p>
<p>And Shayba and Abu Jahl <br/>
And Dhu’l-Rijl 3 and Ibn Jud'an also, </p>
<p>With burning throats in mourning garb displaying bereavement. <br/>
Dead in Badr’s well lay many, </p>
<p>Brave in w 7 ar, generous in times of dearth; </p>
<p>Error called them and some responded <br/>
(For error has ways easy to adopt). </p>
<p>Now they are in Hell, </p>
<p>Too occupied to rage furiously against us. </p>
<p>Al-Harith b. Hisham b. al-Mughlra answered him thus: </p>
<p>I wonder at folk whose fool sings <br/>
Of folly captious and vain, </p>
<p>Singing about the slain at Badr </p>
<p>When young and old vied in glorious endeavour, </p>
<p>The brave swordsman of Lu’ayy, Ibn Ghalib, </p>
<p>Thrusting in battle, feasting the hungry in times of dearth; </p>
<p>They died nobly, they did not sell their family <br/>
For strangers alien in stock and homeland, </p>
<p>Like you w 7 ho have made Ghassan your special friends <br/>
Instead of us—a sorry deed, </p>
<p>An impious, odious crime, and a severing of the ties of blood; </p>
<p>Men of judgement and understanding perceive your wrongdoing. <br/>
True, they are men w'ho have passed away, </p>
<p>But the best death is on the battlefield. </p>
<p>Rejoice not that you have killed them, </p>
<p>For their death will bring you repeated disaster. </p>
<p>Now they are dead you will always be divided, </p>
<p>1 Or ‘its messages’. </p>
<p>2 shaml , or ‘lived in harmony’. See Lyall, The Poems of 'Amr son of Qamiah, Cambridge, <br/>

<p>343 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Not one people as you desire, </p>
<p>By the loss of Ibn Jud'an, the praiseworthy, </p>
<p>And 'Utba, and him who is called Abu Jahl among you. </p>
<p>Shayba and Al-Walld were among them, </p>
<p>Umayya, the refuge of the poor, and Dhu’l-Rijl. 1 <br/>
Weep for these and not for others, </p>
<p>The keening women will bew 7 ail their loss and bereavement, </p>
<p>Say to the people of Mecca, Assemble yourselves <br/>
And go to palmy Medina’s forts, </p>
<p>Defend yourselves and fight, O people of Ka'b, </p>
<p>With your polished and burnished swords <br/>
Or pass the night in fear and trembling <br/>
By day meaner than the sandal that is trodden underfoot. </p>
<p>But know 7 , O men that by Al-Lat, I am sure <br/>
That you will not rest without taking vengeance. </p>
<p>All of you, don your mall, take the spear, </p>
<p>The helmet, sharp sword and arrow's. </p>
<p>Dirar b. al-Khattab t&gt;. Mirdas brother of B. Muharib b. Fihr said: </p>
<p>I wonder at the boasting of Aus w'hen death is coming to them to¬ <br/>
morrow 7 </p>
<p>(Since time contains its warnings) </p>
<p>And at the boasting of the Banu’I-Najjar because certain men died <br/>
there, </p>
<p>For all of them were steadfast men. </p>
<p>If some of our men were left dead <br/>
We shall leave others dead on the field. 2 <br/>
Our flying steeds will carry us among you, </p>
<p>Till we slake our vengeance, O Banu’l-Aus, </p>
<p>We shall return to the charge in the midst of the Banu’I-Najjar, </p>
<p>Our horses snorting under the weight of the spearmen clad in mail. <br/>
Your dead w 7 e shall leave with vultures circling round <br/>
To look for help but a vain desire. </p>
<p>Yathrib’s women will mourn them, </p>
<p>Their nights long and sleepless <br/>
Because our sw'ords will cut them dow 7 n, </p>
<p>Dripping with the blood of their victims. </p>
<p>Though you won on the day of Badr <br/>
Your good fortune was plainly due to Ahmad <br/>
And the chosen band, his friends, </p>
<p>Who protected him in battle when death w 7 as at hand, </p>
<p>Abu Bakr and Hamza could be numbered among them </p>
<p>Apparently al-Aswad the Makhzumite whose leg was cut off as he tried to drink <br/>
from the well at Badr is meant. See W. 442. </p>
<p>2 i.e. of the enemy. C. and W. differ in this line. </p>
<p>344 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>And 'All among those you could mention, </p>
<p>Abu Hafs and 'Uthman were of them, </p>
<p>Sa'd too, if anyone was present, </p>
<p>Those men—not the begettings of Aus and Najjar— </p>
<p>Should be the object of your boasting, </p>
<p>But their father was from Lu’ayy Ibn Ghalib, </p>
<p>Ka'b and 'Amir when noble families are reckoned. </p>
<p>They are the men who repelled the cavalry on every front, </p>
<p>The noble and glorious on the day of battle. </p>
<p>Ka'b b. Malik brother of the B. Salima said: </p>
<p>I wonder at God’s deed, since He <br/>
Docs what He wills, none can defeat Him. </p>
<p>He decreed that we should meet at Badr <br/>
An evil band (and evil ever leads to death). </p>
<p>They had summoned their neighbours on all sides <br/>
Until they formed a great host. </p>
<p>At us alone they came with ill intent, </p>
<p>Ka'b and 'Amir and all of them. </p>
<p>With us was God’s apostle with Aus round him <br/>
Like a strong impregnable fortress <br/>
The tribes of Banu Najjar beneath his banner <br/>
Advancing in light armour while the dust rose high. </p>
<p>When we met them and every steadfast warrior <br/>
Ventured his life with his comrades <br/>
521 We testified to the unity of God </p>
<p>And that His apostle brought the truth. </p>
<p>When our light swords were unsheathed <br/>
’Twas as though fires flashed at their movement. </p>
<p>With them we smote them and they scattered <br/>
And the impious met death, </p>
<p>Abu Jahl lay dead on his face </p>
<p>And 'Utba our swords left in the dust. 1 </p>
<p>Shayba and Al-Taymi they left on the battlefield, </p>
<p>Everyone of them denied Him who sitteth on the throne. </p>
<p>They became fuel for Hell, </p>
<p>For every unbeliever must go there. </p>
<p>It will consume them, while the stoker <br/>
Increases its heat with pieces of iron and stone. 2 <br/>
God’s apostle had called them to him </p>
<p>But they turned away, saying, ‘You are nothing but a sorcerer.’ <br/>
Because God willed to destroy them, </p>
<p>And none can avert what He decrees. </p>
<p>1 Readme \ifiru with some authorities for 'athiru, though these letters sometimes inter¬ <br/>
change. 1 Cf. Sura 18. 95 . </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 345 </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. al-Ziba'ra al-Sahmi (an ally of the B. 'Abdu’l-Dar), 1 be¬ <br/>
wailing the slain at Badr, said (539): </p>
<p>What noble warriors, handsome men, lie round Badr’s battlefield. </p>
<p>They left behind them Nubayh and Munabbih and <br/>
The two sons of Rabi'a’, best fighters against odds, </p>
<p>And the generous Harith, whose face shone <br/>
Like the full moon illuminating night; </p>
<p>And al-'As b. Munabbih, the strong, </p>
<p>Like a long lance without a flaw. </p>
<p>His origin and his ancestors </p>
<p>And the glory of his father’s and his mother’s kin raise him high. </p>
<p>If one must weep and show great grief <br/>
Let it be over the glorious chief Ibn Hisham, </p>
<p>God, lord of creatures, save Abu’l-Walid and his family, </p>
<p>And grant them special favour. </p>
<p>Hassan b. Thabit al-Ansarl answered him: </p>
<p>Weep, may your eyes weep blood, 522 </p>
<p>Their rapid flow ever renewed. </p>
<p>Why weep for those who ran to evil ways ? </p>
<p>Why have you not mentioned the virtues of our people <br/>
And our glorious, purposeful, tolerant, courageous one, </p>
<p>The prophet, soul of virtue and generosity, </p>
<p>The truest man that ever swore an oath ? </p>
<p>One who resembles him and does his teaching <br/>
Was the most praised there not without effect. 2 </p>
<p>Hassan also Said: </p>
<p>A maiden obsesses thy mind in sleep <br/>
Giving the sleeper a drink with cool lips <br/>
Like musk mingled with pure water <br/>
Or old wine red as the blood of sacrifices. </p>
<p>Wide in the rump, her buttocks ripples of fat, </p>
<p>Vivacious, not hasty in swearing an oath. </p>
<p>Her well-covered hips as she sits </p>
<p>Form a hollow in her back like a marble mortar, </p>
<p>So lazy she can hardly go to bed, </p>
<p>Of beautiful body and lovely figure. </p>
<p>By day I never fail to think of her, </p>
<p>1 In deference to the text these words have been retained; but (i) they occur after <br/>
I.H.'s interpolation in which he ascribes the poem to at-A'sha b. Zurara, an ally of R. </p>
<p>*Abdu Naufal, and (2) 'Abdullah, though he belonged to Sahm who were in the ahlaf <br/>
alliance with B, 'Abdu’l-Dar, could hardly be called a halt/. Therefore it looks as if the <br/>
words refer to al-'Asha. Whether I.H. inserted them because he knew that I.I. differed <br/>
from him, or whether someone else did for the same reason, it is impossible to say. </p>
<p>1 The line is clumsy and the syntax questionable. </p>
<p>346 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>By night my dreams inflame my desire for her. </p>
<p>I swear I will not forget to think of her <br/>
Until my bones lie in the grave. </p>
<p>O woman who foolishly blames me, </p>
<p>I refuse to accept blame on account of my love; </p>
<p>She came to me at dawn after I woke <br/>
When life’s troubles were at hand. </p>
<p>She told me that man is sad all his life <br/>
Because he lacks plenty of camels; </p>
<p>If you lied in what you said </p>
<p>May you escape the consequences as Al-Harith b. Hisham did. </p>
<p>He left his friends fearing to fight in their defence, </p>
<p>And escaped by giving his horse free rein. </p>
<p>It left the swift steeds behind in the desert; </p>
<p>As the weighted rope drops down the well. </p>
<p>His mare galloped away at full speed while <br/>
His friends remained in their evil plight <br/>
[His brothers and his family were in the battle <br/>
523 In which God gave the Muslims victory— </p>
<p>For God accomplishes His work—war ground them to powder, </p>
<p>Its fire blazed (with them as fuel). </p>
<p>But for God and the animal’s speed (our horses) had left him </p>
<p>A prey to wild beasts trodden under their hoofs.] 1 </p>
<p>Some of them firmly bound prisoners (though they were) </p>
<p>Hawks protecting (their young) when they met the spears; </p>
<p>Some prostrate never to answer to the call <br/>
Till the highest mountains cease to be, </p>
<p>In shame and plain disgrace when they saw </p>
<p>The sword blades driving every resolute chief before them. </p>
<p>Swords in the hands of noble valiant chiefs, </p>
<p>Whose noble ancestry is vindicated without searching inquiry. <br/>
Sw 7 ords that strike fire from steel <br/>
Like lightning ’neath the storm clouds. </p>
<p>Al-Harith answered him and said: </p>
<p>The people know well 2 I did not leave the fight until my steed w'as <br/>
foaming with blood </p>
<p>I knew that if I fought alone I should be killed; my death would not <br/>
injure the enemy </p>
<p>So I withdrew and left my friends meaning to avenge them another <br/>
day. </p>
<p>1 These three verses are obviously a later interpolation. The syntax requires that the <br/>
partitive min should follow its antecedent ‘his friends’. Moreover, the ostentatious piety of <br/>
these verses is foreign to Hassan. </p>
<ul>
<li>C. has ‘God knows best’, but this is almost certainly wrong. I have followed the text <br/>
of W. </li>
</ul>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 347 </p>
<p>This is what Al-Harith said in excuse for running away from the battle <br/>
of Badr (540). </p>
<p>Hassan also said: 1 </p>
<p>Quraysh knew on the day of Badr, </p>
<p>The day of captivity and violent slaughter, </p>
<p>That when the lances crossed we were the victors <br/>
In the battle of Abu’l-Walid. </p>
<p>We killed Rabl'a’s two sons the day they came <br/>
Clad in double mail against us. </p>
<p>Hakim fled on the day that the Banu’l-Najjar <br/>
Advanced upon them like lions. </p>
<p>All the men of Fihr turned tail, </p>
<p>The miserable Harith abandoned them from afar. 524 </p>
<p>You met shame and death </p>
<p>Quick, decisive, under the neck vein. </p>
<p>All the force turned tail together. </p>
<p>They paid no heed to ancestral honour. </p>
<p>Hassan also said: 2 </p>
<p>O Harith, you took a base decision in war <br/>
And the day when ancestral fame is shown, </p>
<p>When you rode a swift-footed noble mare, </p>
<p>Rapid-paced and long in flank, </p>
<p>Leaving your people behind to be slain, </p>
<p>Thinking only of escape when you should have stood fast. </p>
<p>Could you not have shown concern for your mother’s son <br/>
Who lay transfixed by spears, his body stripped ? </p>
<p>God hastened to destroy his host </p>
<p>In shameful disgrace and painful punishment! (541). </p>
<p>Hassan also said (54a): 3 </p>
<p>A bold intrepid man—no cow T ard— </p>
<p>Led those clad in light chain armour. </p>
<p>I mean the apostle of God the Creator </p>
<p>Who favoured him with piety and goodness above all; </p>
<p>You had said you would protect your caravan <br/>
And that Badr’s waters could not be reached 4 by us. </p>
<p>There we had come down, not heeding your words so that <br/>
We drank to the full without stint, </p>
<p>Holding fast to an unseverable rope, </p>
<p>The w-ell plaited rope of God that stretches far. </p>
<p>We have the apostle and we have the truth which w r e follow </p>

Faithful to his promise, intrepid, a brilliant star, </p>
<p>A full moon that casts light on every noble man ( 543 )* </p>
<p>Hassan also said - . 1 </p>
<p>The Banu Asad were disappointed and their raiders returned <br/>
On the day of the Well in misery and disgrace. </p>
<p>Abu’I-'As soon lay dead on the ground: </p>
<p>Hurled from the back of his galloping steed: </p>
<p>He met his end with his weapons, good fighter as he w'as <br/>
When he lay still in death. </p>
<p>The man Zam'a we left with his throat severed, </p>
<p>His life blood flowing away, </p>
<p>His forehead cushioned in the dust, </p>
<p>His nostrils defiled with filth; </p>
<p>I bn Qays escaped with a remnant of his tribe <br/>

<p>Hassan also said: 2 </p>
<p>Can anyone say if the Meccans know </p>
<p>How we slew the unbelievers in their evil hour ? </p>
<p>We killed their leaders in the battle <br/>
And they returned a shattered force; </p>
<p>We killed Abu Jahl and 'Utba before him, </p>
<p>And Shayba fell forward with his hands outstretched. 3 <br/>
We killed Suwayd and 'Utba after him. </p>
<p>Tu'ma also in the dust of combat. </p>
<p>Many a noble, generous man we slew <br/>
Of lofty line, illustrious among his people. </p>
<p>We left them as meat for hyaenas <br/>
Later to burn in Hell fire. 4 </p>
<p>I’faith Malik’s horsemen and their followers w f cre no protection <br/>
When they met us at Badr (544). </p>
<p>Hassan also said 5 </p>
<p>Hakim’s speed saved him on the day of Badr <br/>
Like the speed of a colt from al-A w'aj s mares, </p>
<p>When he saw Badr’s valley walls </p>
<p>Swarming with the black-mailed squadrons of Khazraj <br/>
Who do not retire when they meet the enemy, </p>
<p>Who march boldly in the middle of the beaten track. </p>

<p>Heroes where the cow r ard turns at bay, </p>
<p>Chiefs giving lavishly with open hand, </p>
<p>Crowned ones bearing the burden of blood-wits, </p>
<p>Ornaments in conclave, persistent in battle, </p>
<p>Smiting the bold with their all-piercing sw^ords (545). </p>
<p>Hassan also said: 526 </p>
<p>Thanks to God w r e fear not an army </p>
<p>How many they be with their assembled troops. </p>
<p>Whenever they brought a multitude against us <br/>
The gracious Lord sufficed us against their sw r ords; </p>
<p>At Badr we raised our spears aloft, </p>
<p>Death did not dismay us. </p>
<p>You could not see a body of men </p>
<p>More dangerous to those they attack wdien w r ar is stirred up, 1 <br/>
But we put our trust [in God] and said: </p>
<p>‘Our swords are our fame and our defence.’ </p>
<p>With them we met them and were victorious <br/>
Though but a band against their thousands. </p>
<p>Hassan also said, satirizing B. Jumah and those of them W'ho w r ere slain: </p>
<p>Banu Jumah rushed headlong to disaster 2 because of their unlucky <br/>
star </p>
<p>(The mean man inevitably meets humiliation). </p>
<p>They w'ere conquered and slain at Badr, </p>
<p>They deserted in all directions, </p>
<p>They rejected the scripture and called Muhammad liar. </p>
<p>But God makes the religion of every apostle victorious; </p>
<p>God curse Abu Khuzayma and his son, </p>
<p>The two Khalids and Sa'id b. 'Aqil. </p>
<p>'Ubayda b. al-Harith said about the battle of Badr, and the cutting off of <br/>
his foot when it was smitten in the fight, when he and Hamza and 'Alt <br/>
fought their enemies (546): </p>
<p>A battle will tell the Meccans about us: </p>
<p>It will make distant men give heed, </p>
<p>When 'Utba died and Shayba after him </p>
<p>And 'LTtba’s eldest son had no cause to be pleased with it. 3 </p>
<p>You may cut off my leg, yet I am a Muslim, </p>
<p>I hope in exchange for a life near to Allah </p>
<p>With Houris fashioned like the most beautiful statues </p>
<p>With the highest heaven for those who mount there. </p>
<p>1 The metaphor is that of the untimely address of the he-camel to the mare. </p>
<p>3 Here there is a pun on the name Jumah. </p>
<p>3 'Utba’s firstborn al-Walld was also slain at Badr. </p>

<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>I have bought it with a life of which I have tasted the best 1 <br/>
And which I have tried until I lost even my next-of-kin. </p>
<p>527 The Merciful honoured me with His favour <br/>
With the garment of Islam to cover my faults. </p>
<p>I did not shrink from fighting them </p>
<p>The day that men called on their peers to fight them, </p>
<p>When they asked the prophet he sought only us three <br/>
So that we came out to the herald; </p>
<p>We met them like lions, brandishing our spears, </p>
<p>We fought the rebellious for God’s sake; </p>
<p>We three did not move from our position <br/>
Till their fate came upon them (547). </p>
<p>When 'Ubayda died of the wound in his leg at the battle of Badr, Ka'b b. <br/>
Malik, the Ansarl, wrote this elegy on him: </p>
<p>O eye, be generous, not niggardly, </p>
<p>With thy true tears; spare them not <br/>
For a man whose death appalled us, </p>
<p>Noble in deed and in descent, </p>
<p>Bold in attack with sharpened sword, </p>
<p>Of noble repute and goodly descent. 2 <br/>
'Ubayda has passed away, we cannot hope <br/>
For good or evil from him, </p>
<p>On the eve of battle he used to protect our rearguard with his sword. <br/>
Ka'b also said: </p>
<p>Have Ghassan heard in their distant haunt </p>
<p>(The best informant is one with knowledge thereof), </p>
<p>That Ma'add shot their arrows at us. </p>
<p>The whole tribe of them were hostile, </p>
<p>Because we worship God, hoping in none other, </p>
<p>528 Hoping for heaven’s gardens since their prophet has come to us. 3 <br/>
A prophet with a glorious inheritance among his people, </p>
<p>And truthful ancestors whose origin made them pure; </p>
<p>Both sides advanced, and we met them like lions <br/>
Whose victims have nothing to hope for; </p>
<p>We smote them in the battle </p>
<p>Till Lu’ayy’s leader fell upon his face; </p>
<p>They fled, and we cut them down with our sharp swords, </p>
<p>Their allies and their tribesmen alike. </p>

<p>Your horsemen did not protect you at Badr, </p>
<p>They could not stand fast when they met us; </p>
<p>We came there with God’s light </p>
<p>Clearing away the cover of darkness from us. </p>
<p>God’s apostle led us, by God’s order, </p>
<p>An order He had fixed by decree; </p>
<p>Your horsemen could not conquer at Badr <br/>
And returned to you in evil case; </p>
<p>Do not hurry, Abu Sufyan, and watch <br/>
For the fine steeds coming up from Kada’, 1 <br/>
By God’s help the holy spirit is among them 2 <br/>
And Michael, what a goodly company! </p>
<p>Talib b. Abu Talib, praising the apostle and lamenting the men of <br/>
Quraysh who were thrown into the pit at Badr, said: </p>
<p>My eye wept copiously </p>
<p>Over Ka'b, though it sees them not. </p>
<p>Ka'b deserted one another in the w'ars, and <br/>
Fate destroyed them, they having greatly sinned. 3 <br/>
And 'Amir this morning are weeping for the misfortunes (that befell <br/>
them). </p>
<p>Shall I ever see them closer (to each other) ? </p>
<p>They are my brothers, their mother no harlot, </p>
<p>And never their guest suffered wrong; </p>
<p>O our brothers 'Abdu Shams and Naufal, may I be your ransom, </p>
<p>Put not war between us. After the love and friendship we had <br/>
Become not (the subject of) stories in which all of you have something 529 <br/>
to complain of. </p>
<p>Do you not know w T hat happened in the w r ar of Dahis <br/>
And w'hen Abu Yaksum’s army filled the ravine? </p>
<p>Had not God the Sole Existent saved you <br/>
You could not have protected your people. </p>
<p>We among Quraysh have done no great w r rong </p>
<p>But merely protected the best man that ever trod the earth; </p>
<p>A standby in misfortunes, generous, </p>
<p>Noble in reputation, no niggard, no wrongdoer. </p>
<p>His door is thronged by those seeking his bounty, </p>
<p>A sea of generosity, vast, unfailing. </p>
<p>By God, my soul will ever be sad, </p>
<p>Restless, until you smite Khazraj well and truly. </p>
<p>Dirar b, al-Khattab al-Fihrl lamenting Abu Jahl said: </p>

<p>At Badr lies imprisoned in the well; </p>
<p>The noble one, not base-born and no niggard. </p>
<p>I swear that my eyes shall never weep for any man <br/>
Now Abu’l-Hakam our chief is slain. </p>
<p>I weep for him whose death brought sorrow to Lu’ayy b. Ghalib, <br/>
To whom death came at Badr where he remains. </p>
<p>You could see fragments of spears in his horse’s chest, </p>
<p>Scraps of his flesh plainly intermingled with them. </p>
<p>No lion lurking in the valley of Bisha, </p>
<p>Where through jungled vales the waters flow, </p>
<p>Was bolder than he when lances clashed, </p>
<p>When the cry went forth among the valiant ‘Dismount’ 1 <br/>
Grieve not overmuch, Mughlra’s kin, be resolute <br/>
(Though he who so grieves is not to be blamed). </p>
<p>Be strong, for death is your glory, </p>
<p>And thereafter at life’s end there is no regret. </p>
<p>I said that victory will be yours </p>
<p>And high renown—no man of sense will doubt it (548). </p>
<p>Al-Harith b. Hisham, bewailing his brother Abu Jahl, said: </p>
<p>Alas my soul for 'Amr! </p>
<p>But can grief avail one whit? 2 <br/>
Someone told me that 'Amr </p>
<p>Was the first of his people to go into the old abandoned pit. </p>
<p>I have always thought it right (that you should be the first), </p>
<p>Since your judgement in the past was sound. </p>
<p>I was happy while you were alive; </p>
<p>Now I am left in a miserable state. </p>
<p>At night when I cannot see him I feel <br/>
A prey to indecision and full of care. </p>
<p>When daylight comes once more </p>
<p>My eye is weary of remembering 'Amr (549). </p>
<p>Abu Bakr b. al-Aswad b. Shu'ub al-Laythl, whose name was Shaddad, <br/>

<p>In the pit, the pit of Badr, </p>
<p>What singing girls and noble boon companions! </p>
<p>1 Or, perhaps, To battle! </p>

And the men of the pass of Na'am </p>
<p>You would mourn over them like the mother of a new-born camel <br/>

<p>The apostle tells us that we shall live, </p>
<p>But how can bodies and wraiths meet again? 2 (550) </p>
<p>Umayya b. Abu’I-Salt, lamenting those who died at Badr, said: </p>
<p>Would’st thou not w r eep over the nobles, </p>
<p>Sons of nobles, praised by all, </p>
<p>As the doves mourn upon the leafy boughs, </p>
<p>Upon the bending branches, </p>
<p>Weeping in soft dejected notes <br/>
When they return at nightfall. </p>
<p>Like them are the weeping women, </p>
<p>The keeners who lift up their voices. </p>
<p>He who weeps them weeps in real sorrow, </p>
<p>He who praises them tells the truth. </p>
<p>What chiefs and leaders <br/>
At Badr and al-'Aqanqal, </p>
<p>At Madafi'u’l-Barqayn and Al-Hannan, </p>
<p>At the end of al-Awashih, </p>
<p>Grey-beards and youths, Bold leaders, </p>
<p>Raiders impetuous! </p>

When it is plain to all beholders, </p>

<p>2 $ada. The old Arabs believed that when a man had been killed and his slayer was still <br/>
at large a bird like an owl came forth from his head crying, ‘Give me to drink’ sc. the slayer’s <br/>
blood. The word facia afterwards came to be applied to the head or brain, and to the corpse <br/>
itself, which seems to be the meaning here. Hama also means the head of a man or the bird <br/>
emerging therefrom which could be conceived as a wraith. For the liqd of our text Bukh. <br/>
iii. 45. 13 has baqa ‘persist’, while Shahrastani, Mila!, 433, has the reading quoted by I.H. <br/>
A poem, that is recognizably another version, will be found in the Risdlatu'l-Ghufrdr <br/>
(J.R.A.S. 1902, p. 818). For the last verse Abu’l-'Ala heard: ‘Does Ibn Kabsha promise us <br/>
that we shall live ?’ This must be early because such a designation of the prophet would <br/>
hardly have been coined in later times. Commentators explain that the prophet was called <br/>
Ibn Kabsha (for Ibn Abu Kabsha) after a man of that name who during the pagan era <br/>
abandoned the religion of his fathers. </p>

were slain: </p>

And hold not thy tears for Zama'a. </p>

<p>On the day of battle and the dust of war. </p>
<p>Those Banu Aswad were brothers like the Gemini, </p>
<p>No treachery and no deceit was in them, </p>
<p>They are the noblest family of Ka'b, </p>
<p>The very summit of excellence. </p>
<p>They produced sons as many as the hairs of the head <br/>
And established them in impregnable positions. 2 <br/>
When misfortune visited their kinsmen <br/>
Their hearts ached for them. </p>
<p>They gave their food when rain failed, </p>
<p>When all was dry and no cloud could be seen (552). </p>
<p>Abu Usama Mu'awiya b. Zuhayr b- Qays b. al-Harith b. Dubay'a <br/>
b. Miizin b. 'Adly b. Jusham b. Mu'awiya, an ally of B. Makhzum (553), <br/>
passed Hubayra b. Abu Wahb as they were running away on the day of 534 <br/>
Badr. Hubayra was exhausted and threw away his coat of mail and <br/>
(Mu'awiya) picked it up and went off with it. Fie composed the following <br/>
lines (554): </p>
<p>When I saw the army panic, </p>
<p>Running away at top speed <br/>
And that their leaders lay dead, </p>
<p>Methought the best of them <br/>
Were like sacrifices to idols. </p>
<p>Many of them lay there dead, </p>
<p>And we were made to meet our fate at Badr. </p>
<p>1 Abu Dharr has an interesting note here of a tradition going back to Abu f lurayra which <br/>
reads thus: ‘The apostle gave us permission to recite the poetry of the pagan era except the <br/>
ode of Umayya b. Abu al-Salt about Badr (i.e. this ode) and the ode of al-A'sha which <br/>
begins ‘‘ahdi biha’ (lines 10-18 in No. 18 of the Dhvdn ed. Geycr which has many variants). </p>
<p>The apostle forbade the recitation of this ode because it lamented the death of the un¬ <br/>
believers and attacked the reputation of the prophet’s companions. It was only for that <br/>
reason that Ibn Hisharn omitted two verses from Umayya’s ode. Similarly al-A'sha’s verse <br/>
praised 'Amr b. Tufayl and satirized 'Alqama b. 'UJatha. ‘Amrdied an unbeliever. ‘Alqama <br/>
became a Muslim, and when the king of the Byzantines asked him about the apostle he spoke <br/>
well of him, and the prophet held that in his favour and remembered him. Some scholars <br/>
say that the prohibition to recite these two odes in the early days of Islam was because of <br/>
the feeling between Muslims and unbelievers, hut when Islam was generally accepted and <br/>
hatred and enmity ceased, there was no harm in citing them. </p>
<p>2 Manaa is explained by the Taj, vol. v, p. 516. In the plural mana at is ‘bastions and <br/>
strongholds’. As manaa is a mountain in Hudhayl territory and mana is high ground in <br/>
Jabal Tayyi’. the general meaning seems clear. </p>
<p>356 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>We left the way and they overtook us <br/>
In waves, like an overwhelming flood; </p>
<p>Some said, ‘Who is Ibn Qays?’ </p>
<p>I said, ‘Abu Usama, without boasting, </p>
<p>I am the Jushamite, that you may know me, </p>
<p>I will announce my lineage, </p>

<p>I swear by Him Who is my Lord </p>
<p>And by the blood-stained pillars of the stoning places </p>
<p>You will see what my true worth is </p>
<p>When men become as fierce as leopards. 3 </p>
<p>No lion from his lair in Tarj— </p>

<p>Who has made his den taboo against intruders <br/>
So that none can approach him even with a force. 4 <br/>

<p>Is swifter than I </p>
<p>When I advance roaring and growling at the enemy <br/>
With arrow's like sharp lances <br/>
Their points like burning coals. </p>

And a strongly fashioned bow, and <br/>
A glittering sword w'hich 'Umayr, the polisher, </p>

Whenever a comrade in distress called <br/>
For my aid in an evil day, </p>
<p>A brother or ally in such case, </p>
<p>Much as I love my lile I answered his call. </p>
<p>I returned to the fray, dispelling gloom, </p>
<p>And shot when faces showed hostility. </p>
<p>Many an adversary have I left on the ground <br/>
To rise painfully like a broken twig. 3 <br/>
When battle was joined I dealt him a blow <br/>
That drew blood—his arteries murmured aloud; </p>
<p>That is what I did on the day of Badr, </p>
<p>Before that I was resourceful and steadfast, </p>
<p>Your brother as you know in war and famine <br/>

<p>The apostle left Badr at the end of the month of Ramadan or in Shawwal. </p>
<p>THE RAID ON B. SUL A YM IN AL-KUDR </p>
<p>540 The apostle stayed only seven nights in Medina before he himself made a <br/>
raid against B. Sulaym (563). He got as far as their watering place called <br/>
al-Kudr and stayed there three nights, returning to Medina without any <br/>
fighting. He stayed there for the rest of Shawwal and Dhu’l-Qa'da, and <br/>
during that time he accepted the ransom of most of the Quraysh prisoners. </p>

<p>THE RAID OF AL-SAWlQ </p>
<p>AbQ Muhammad 'Abdu’I-Malik b. Hisham from Ziyad b. 'Abdullah <br/>
al-Bakka’i from Muhammad b. Ishaq al-Muttalibl said: Then Abu <br/>
Sufyan b. Harb made the raid of Sawiq in Dhu’i-Hijja. The polytheists <br/>
were in charge of the pilgrimage that year. Muhammad b. Ja'far b. <br/>
al-Zubayr and Yazld b. Ruman and one whose veracity I do not suspect <br/>
from 'Abdullah b. Ka'b b. Malik who was one of the most learned Helpers <br/>
told me that when Abu Sufyan returned to Mecca and the Quraysh <br/>
fugitives returned from Badr. he swore that he would not practise ablution 1 <br/>
until he had raided Muhammad. Accordingly he sallied forth with two <br/>
hundred riders from Quraysh to fulfil his vow. He took the Nejd road and <br/>
stopped by the upper part of a watercourse which led to a mountain called <br/>
Thayb about one post distance from Medina. Then he sallied forth by <br/>
night and came to the B. al-Nadlr under cover of darkness. He came to <br/>
Huyayy b. Akhtab and knocked upon his door, but as he was afraid of him <br/>
he refused to open the door, so he went to Sallam b. Mishkam, who was <br/>
their chief at that time, and keeper of the public purse. He asked permis¬ <br/>
sion to come in and Sallam entertained him with food and drink, and gave <br/>
him secret information about the Muslims. He rejoined his companions <br/>
at the end of the night and sent some of them to Medina. They came to an <br/>
outlying district called Al-‘Urayd and there they burnt some young palm- <br/>
trees and finding one of the Helpers and an ally of his working the fields <br/>
there, they killed them and returned. People got warning of them and so <br/>
the apostle went out in pursuit (564). He got as far as Qarqaratu’l-Kudr 2 <br/>
and then returned because Abu Sufyan and his companions had eluded <br/>
him. They saw some of the provisions which the raiders had thrown away <br/>
m the fields to lighten their baggage so as to get away quickly. When the <br/>
apostle brought the Muslims back they asked, ‘Do you hope that this will 544 <br/>
count (with God) in our favour as a raid?’ and he replied, ‘Yes’ (565). </p>
<p>When he went away Abu Sufyan said of Sallam’s treatment of him: </p>
<p>I chose one man out of Medina as an ally, </p>
<p>I had no cause to regret it, though I did not stay long. </p>
<p>Sallam ibn Mishkam gave me good wine, </p>
<p>He refreshed me in full measure despite my haste. </p>
<p>When the raiders turned back I said <br/>
(Unwilling to burden him), </p>
<p>Look forward to raiding and booty. </p>
<p>Consider, for the people are the pure stock of Lu’ayy, </p>
<p>Not a mixed rabble of Jurhum’. </p>
<p>It was no more than (spending) part of the night by a traveller <br/>
Who came hungry though not needy and destitute/ </p>
<p>' A euphemism for abstaining from sexual intercourse. </p>
<p>About eight posts distance from Medina. </p>
<p>^2 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>T- 1365 [Abu Sufyan had composed some verses to incite Quraysh when he <br/>
got ready to march from Mecca to Medina: </p>
<p>Return to the attack on Yathrib and the lot of them, </p>
<p>For what they have collected is booty for you. </p>
<p>Though the battle of the cistern went in their favour <br/>
The future will restore your fortunes. </p>
<p>I swear that I will not come near women </p>
<p>Nor shall I use the water of purification </p>
<p>Until you destroy the tribes of Aus and Khazraj. </p>
<p>My heart is burning for revenge * </p>
<p>Ka'b b. Malik answered him: </p>
<p>The Muslims' arc sorry for Ibn Harb’s army, </p>
<p>So futile in the harra _ _ 2 </p>
<p>When those who were sick of their provision cast away the burden </p>

<p>Bare of gold 1 and wealth and of </p>

<p>TIIF. RAID OF D1IU AMARR </p>
<p>When the apostle returned from the raid of al-SawIq he stayed in Medina <br/>
for the rest of Dhu’l-i Iijju, or nearly all of it. Then he raided Tajd, <br/>
making for Ghataian. This is the raid of Dhu Amarr (566). He stayed in <br/>
Xajd during the month of Safar, or nearly all of it, and then returned to <br/>
Medina without any fighting. There he remained for the month of <br/>
Rabl'u’l-Awwal, or a day or two less. </p>
<p>THE raid of al-furu* of bahran </p>
<p>Then he made a raid on Quraysh as far as Bahran, a mine in the Hijaz in <br/>
the neighbourhood of Al-FuruV He stayed there for the next two months <br/>
anti then returned to Medina without fighting (56/)* </p>

<p>THE AFFAIR OF THE B. QAYNUQA* </p>
<p>Meanwhile there was the affair of the B. Qaynuqah The apostle assembled <br/>
them in their market and addressed them as follows: ‘O Jews, beware lest <br/>
God bring upon you the vengeance that He brought upon Quraysh and <br/>
become Muslims. You know that I am a prophet who has been sent— <br/>
you will find that in your scriptures and God’s covenant with you.’ They <br/>
replied, ‘O Muhammad, you seem to think that we arc your people. Do <br/>
not deceive yourself because you encountered a people with no knowledge <br/>
of war and got the better of them; for by God if we fight you, you will find <br/>
that w T e are real men!’ </p>
<p>A freedman of the family of Zayd b. Thabit from Sa'Id b. Jubayr or from <br/>
'Ikrima from Ibn 'Abbas told me that the latter said the following verses <br/>
came down about them: </p>
<p>‘Say to those who disbelieve: you will be vanquished and gathered to <br/>
Hell, an evil resting place. You have already had a sign in the two forces <br/>
which met’, i.c. the apostle’s companions at Badr and the Quraysh. <br/>
‘One force fought in the way of God; the other, disbelievers, thought they <br/>
saw double their own force with their very eyes. God strengthens with <br/>
His help whom He will. Verily in that is an example for the discerning.” </p>
<p>*Asim b. ‘Umar b. Qatada said that the B. Qaynuqa' were the first of the <br/>
Jews to break their agreement with the apostle and to go to war, between <br/>
Badr and Uhud (568), and the apostle besieged them until they surrendered 546 <br/>
unconditionally. 'Abdullah b. Ubayy b. Salul went to him when God <br/>
had put them in his power and said, ‘O Muhammad, deal kindly with my <br/>
clients’ (now they were allies of Khazraj), but the apostle put him off. </p>
<p>He repeated the words, and the apostle turned away from him, whereupon <br/>
he thrust his hand into the collar of the apostle’s robe (569); the apostle <br/>
was so angry that his face became almost black. He said, ‘Confound you, <br/>
let me go.’ He answered, ‘No, by God, I will not let you go until you deal <br/>
kindly with my clients. Four hundred men without mail and three hundred <br/>
mailed protected me from all mine enemies; would you cut them down in <br/>
one morning? By God, I am a man who fears that circumstances may <br/>
change.’ The apostle said, ‘You can have them (570).’ </p>
<p>My father Ishaq b. Yasur told 'me from ‘Ubada b. al-Walid b. 'Ubada <br/>
b. al-Samit who said: when the B. Qaynuqa' fought the apostle ‘Abdullah <br/>
b. Ubayy espoused their cause and defended them, and ‘ Ubada b. al-Sfmnt, <br/>
who was one of the B. ‘Auf, who had the same alliance with them as had <br/>
‘Abdullah, went to the apostle and renounced all responsibility for them <br/>
in favour of God and the apostle, saying, ‘O apostle of God, 1 take God <br/>
and His apostle and the believers as my friends, and I renounce mv <br/>
agreement and friendship with these unbelievers.’ Concerning him and <br/>
‘Abdullah b. Ubayy, this passage from the chapter of the Table came down : 2 </p>
<p>1 Sura 3 . 10 . 1 Sura 3 . 56 f. </p>
<p>3 64 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>‘O you who believe, take not Jews and Christians as friends. They are <br/>
friends one of another. Who of you takes them as friends is one of them. <br/>
God will not guide the unjust people. You can see those in whose heart <br/>
547 there is sickness’, i.e. 'Abdullah b. Lbayy when he said, I fear a change <br/>
of circumstances.’ ‘Acting hastily in regard to them they say we fear that <br/>
change of circumstances may overtake us. Peradventure God will bring <br/>
victory or an act from Him so that they will be sorry for their secret <br/>
thoughts, and those who believe will say, Are these those who swore by <br/>
God their most binding oath?’ [that they were with you], as far as God’s <br/>
words, ‘Verily God and His apostle are your friends, and those who <br/>
believe, who perform prayer, give alms and bow in homage, mentioning <br/>
*Ubada taking God and" His apostle and the believers as friends, and <br/>
renouncing his agreement and friendship with the B. Qaynuqa , 1 hose who <br/>
take God and His apostle and the believers as friends, they are God’s party, <br/>
they are the victorious.’ </p>
<p>THE RAID OF ZAYD B. HARITIIA TO AL-QARADA </p>
<p>The story of the foray of Zayd who captured the caravan of Quraysh, in <br/>
which was Abu Sufyan b. Iiarb, when the apostle sent him to al-Qarada, <br/>
a watering-place in Najd, is as follows: </p>
<p>Quraysh were afraid to follow their usual route to Syria after what had <br/>
happened at Badr, so they went by the Iraq route. Some of their merchants <br/>
went out, among whom was Abu Sufyan, carrying a great deal of silver <br/>
which formed the larger part of their merchandise. They hired a man from <br/>
the B. Bakr b. Wa’il called Furat b. Hayyati to conduct them by that route <br/>
(571). The apostle duly sent Zayd, and he met them by that watering-place <br/>
and captured the caravan and its contents, but the men got away. He <br/>
brought the spoil to the apostle. </p>
<p>Hassan b. Thabit after Uhud concerning the last raid of Badr taunted <br/>
Quraysh for taking the Iraq road thus: </p>
<p>You can say good-bye to the streams of Damascus, for in between <br/>
Are swords like the mouths of pregnant camels who feed on arak trees <br/>
In the hands of men who migrated to their Lord <br/>
And His true helpers and the angels. </p>
<p>548 If they go to the lowland of the sandy valley <br/>
Say to them, There is no road here (572). 1 </p>
<p>THE KILLING OF KA'b B. AL-ASHRAF </p>
<p>After the Quraysh defeat at Badr the apostle had sent Zayd b. Haritha to <br/>
the lower quarter and 'Abdullah b. Rawaha to the upper quarter to tell the <br/>
Muslims of Medina of God’s victory and of the polytheists who had been <br/>
killed. 'Abdullah b. al-Mughith b. Abu Burda al-Zafar! and 'Abdullah b. <br/>
Abu Bakr b. Muhammad b. 'Amr b. Hazm and 'Asim b. 'Umar b. Qatada </p>
<p>1 Cf. W. 667. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 365 </p>
<p>and Salih b. Abu Umama b. Sahl each gave me a part of the following <br/>
story: Ka'b b. al-Ashraf who tvas one of the Tayyi’ of the subsection B. <br/>
Nabhan whose mother was from the B. al-Nadlr, when he heard the news <br/>
said, ‘Is this true? Did Muhammad actually kill these whom these two <br/>
men mention ? (i.e. Zayd and 'Abdullah b. Rawaha). These are the nobles <br/>
of the Arabs and kingly men; by God, if Muhammad has slain these people <br/>
’twerc better to be dead than alive.’ 1 </p>
<p>When the enemy of God became certain that the news was true he <br/>
left the town and went to Mecca to stay with al-Muttalib b. Abu Wada'a <br/>
b. Dubayra al-Sahml w f ho was married to 'Atika d. Abu’l-Ts b. Umayya <br/>
b. 'Abdu Shams b. 'Abdu Manaf. She took him in and entertained him <br/>
hospitably. He began to inveigh against the apostle and to recite verses <br/>
in which he bewailed the Quraysh who were thrown into the pit after <br/>
having been slain at Badr. He said: </p>
<p>Badr’s mill ground out the blood of its people. </p>
<p>At events like Badr you should weep and cry. </p>
<p>The best of the people were slain round their cisterns, 549 </p>
<p>Don’t think it strange that the princes were left lying. </p>
<p>How many noble handsome men, </p>
<p>The refuge of the homeless were slain, </p>
<p>Liberal when the stars gave no rain, </p>
<p>Who bore others’ burdens, ruling and taking their due fourth. </p>
<p>Some people w'hose anger pleases me say <br/>
‘Ka'b b. al-Ashraf is utterly dejected’. </p>
<p>They are right. O that the earth when they were killed <br/>
Had split asunder and engulfed its people, </p>
<p>That he who spread the report had b^en thrust through <br/>
Or lived cowering blind and deaf. </p>
<p>I was told that all the Banu’l-Mughlra were humiliated <br/>
And brought low by the death of Abu’l-Hakim <br/>
And the tw r o sons of Rabi'a with him, </p>
<p>And Munabbih and the others did not attain (such honour) as those <br/>
who were slain. 2 </p>
<p>I was told that al-Harith ibn Hisham <br/>
Is doing well and gathering troops <br/>
To visit Yathrib with armies, </p>
<p>For only the noble, handsome man protects the loftiest 3 reputation <br/>
( 573 )- </p>
<p>Hassan b. Thabit answered him thus: </p>
<p>Does Ka'b weep for him again and again <br/>
And live in humiliation hearing nothing ? 4 </p>
<p>1 Lit- the inside of the earth is better than the outside. </p>
<p>3 Or ‘Tubba' did not’ (so A. Dh.). Waq, has hal for ma and al-tubba u for tcatubbau. </p>
<p>3 The reading must be 'ula, because yahnti governs an accusative. </p>
<p>4 The question is ironical: let him weep if he wants to. The text of this poem is dubious. </p>
<p>366 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>In the vale of Badr I saw some of them, the slain, </p>
<p>Eyes pouring with tears for them. </p>
<p>Weep fAtika], for you have made a mean slave weep <br/>
Like a pup following a little bitch. </p>
<p>God has given satisfaction to our leader </p>
<p>And put to shame and prostrated those who fought him. </p>
<p>Those whose hearts were torn with fear <br/>
Escaped and fled away (574). </p>
<p>550 A Muslim woman of B. Murayd, a clan of Ball who were allied attach <br/>
ments of B. Umayya b. Zayd, called al-Ja'adira answered Ka'b (575): </p>
<p>This slave shows great concern <br/>
Weeping over the slain untiringly. ■ </p>
<p>May the eye that weeps over the slain at Badr weep on <br/>
And may Lu ayy b. Ghalib weep double as much! </p>
<p>Would that those weltering in their blood </p>
<p>Could be seen by those who live between Mecca’s mountains! </p>
<p>They would know for certain and would see <br/>
How they were dragged along by hair and beard. 1 </p>
<p>Ka'b b. al-Ashraf answered her: </p>
<p>Drive off that fool of yours that you may be safe <br/>
From talk that has no sense! </p>
<p>Do you taunt me because I shed tears <br/>
For people who loved me sincerely? </p>
<p>As long as I live I shall weep and remember </p>
<p>The merits of people whose glory is in Mecca’s houses. </p>
<p>By my life Murayd used to be far from hostile <br/>
But now they are become as jackals. </p>
<p>They ought to have their noses cut off </p>
<p>For insulting the two clans of Lu’ayy b. Ghalib. </p>
<p>I give my share in Murayd to Ja'dar </p>
<p>In truth, by God’s house, between Mecca’s mountains. </p>
<ul>
<li>3^9 (T. Then Ka b returned to Medina and composed amatory verses </li>
</ul>
<p>about Ummu’l-Fadl d. al-Harith, saying: </p>
<p>Are you off without stopping in the valley <br/>
And leaving Ummu’l-Fadl in Mecca ? </p>
<p>Out would come what she bought from the pedlar of bottles, <br/>
Henna and hair dye. </p>
<p>What lies ’twixt ankle and elbow is in motion 2 <br/>
When she tries to stand and does not. </p>
<p>Or, reading mahazzahum ‘the sword cuts above their beards and eyebrows'. </p>
<p>Presumably her buttocks are meant; they would be between her ankle and her elbow <br/>
as^she reclined. Large and heavy buttocks were marks of female beauty among the old </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 367 </p>
<p>Like Umm Hakim when she was with us <br/>
The link between us firm and not to be cut. </p>
<p>She is one of B. 'Amir who bewitches the heart, </p>
<p>And if she wished she could cure my sickness. </p>
<p>The glory of w r omen and of a people is their father, </p>
<p>A people held in honour true to their oath. </p>
<p>Never did I see the sun rise at night till I saw her <br/>
Display herself to us in the darkness of the night!) </p>
<p>Then he composed amatory verses of an insulting nature about the <br/>
Muslim women. The apostle said—according to what 'Abdullah b. <br/>
al-Mughlth b. Abu Burda told me—‘Who will rid me of Ibnu’l-Ashraf?’ <br/>
Muhammad b. Maslama, brother of the B. 'Abdu’I-Ashhal, said, ‘I will <br/>
deal with him for you, O apostle of God, I will kill him.’ He said, ‘Do so if <br/>
you can.’ So Muhammad b. Maslama returned and waited for three days <br/>
without food or drink, apart from what was absolutely necessary. When <br/>
the apostle was told of this he summoned him and asked him why he had <br/>
given up eating and drinking. He replied that he had given him an under¬ <br/>
taking and he did not know whether he could fulfil it. The apostle said, </p>
<p>‘AH that is incumbent upon you is that you should try.’ He said, ‘O apostle <br/>
of God, we shall have to tell lies.’ He answered, ‘Say what you like, for 5S 1 <br/>
you are free in the matter.’ Thereupon he and Silkan b. Salama b. Waqsh <br/>
who was Abu Na’ila one of the B. 'Abdu’l-Ashhal, foster-brother of Ka'b, <br/>
and 'Abbad b. Bishr b. Waqsh, and al-Harith b. Aus b. Mu'adh of the B. <br/>
'Abdu’l-Ashhal and Abu 'Abs b. Jabr of the B. Haritha conspired together <br/>
and sent Silkan to the enemy of God, Ka'b b. Ashraf, before they came to <br/>
him. He talked to him some time and they recited poetry one to the other, <br/>
for Silkan was fond of poetry. Then he said, ‘O I bn Ashraf, I have come to <br/>
you about a matter which I want to tell you of and wish you to keep secret.’ <br/>
‘Very well,’ he replied. He went on, ‘The coming of this man is a great <br/>
trial to us. It has provoked the hostility of the Arabs, and they are all in <br/>
league against us. The roads have become impassable so that our families <br/>
are in want and privation, and we and our families are in great distress.’ <br/>
Ka'b answered, ‘By God, I kept telling you, O Ibn Salama, that the things <br/>
1 warned you of would happen.’ Silkan said to him, ‘I want you to sell us <br/>
food and we will give you a pledge of security and you deal generously in <br/>
the matter.’ He replied, ‘Will you give me your sons as a pledge?’ He <br/>
said, ‘You want to insult us. I have friends who share my opinion and <br/>
I want to bring them to you so that you may sell to them and act generously, <br/>
and we will give you enough weapons for a good pledge.’ Silkan’s object <br/>
was that he should not take alarm at the sight of weapons when they <br/>
brought them. Ka'b answered, ‘Weapons are a good pledge.’ Thereupon <br/>
Silkan returned to his companions, told them what had happened, and <br/>
ordered them to take their arms. Then they went away and assembled with <br/>
him and met the apostle (576). </p>
<p>368 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Thaur b. Zayd from ‘Ikrima from Ibn ‘Abbas told me the apostle walked <br/>
with them as far as BaqI'u’l-Gharqad. Then he sent them off, saying, ‘Go </p>
<p>552 in God’s name; O God help them.’ So saying, he returned to his house. <br/>
Now it was a moonlight night and they journeyed on until they came to his <br/>
castle, and Abu Na’ila called out to him. He had only recently married, <br/>
and he jumped up in the bedsheet, and his wife took hold of the end of it <br/>
and said, ‘You are at war, and those who are at war do not go out at this <br/>
hour.’ He replied, ‘It is Abu Na’ila. Had he found me sleeping he would <br/>
not have woken me.’ She answered, ‘By God, I can feel evil in his voice.’ <br/>
Ka'b answered, ‘Even if the call were for a stab a brave man must answer <br/>
it.’ So he went down and talked to them for some time, while they conversed <br/>
with him. Then Abu Na’ila said, ‘Would you like to walk with us to <br/>
Shi'b al-'Ajiiz, so that we can talk for the rest of the night?’ ‘If you like,’ <br/>
he answered, so they went off walking together; and after a time Abu <br/>
Na’ila ran his hand through his hair. Then he smelt his hand, and said, <br/>
‘I have never smelt a scent finer than this.’ They walked on farther and he <br/>
did the same so that Ka'b suspected no evil. Then after a space he did it <br/>
for the third time, and cried, ‘Smite the enemy of God!’ So they smote <br/>
him, and their swords clashed over him with no effect. Muhammad b. <br/>
Maslama said, ‘I remembered my dagger when I saw that our swords were <br/>
useless, and I seized it. Meanwhile the enemy of God had made such a <br/>
noise that every fort around us was showing a light. I thrust it into the <br/>
lower part of his body, then I bore down upon it until I reached his <br/>
genitals, and the enemy of God fell to the ground. Al-Harith had been <br/>
hurt, being wounded either in his head or in his foot, one of our swords <br/>
having struck him. We wont away, passing by the B. Umayya b. Zayd <br/>
and then the B. Qurayza and then Bu'ath until we wont up the Harra of <br/>
al-'Urayd. 1 Our friend al-Harith had lagged behind, weakened by loss of <br/>
blood, so wo waited for him for some time until he came up, following our <br/>
tracks. We carried him and brought him to the apostle at the end of the <br/>
night. We saluted him as he stood praying, and he came out to us, and we <br/>
told him that wo had killed God’s enemy. He spat upon our comrade’s <br/>
wounds, and both he and we returned to our families. Our attack upon <br/>
God’s enemy cast terror among the Jews, and there was no Jew in Medina <br/>
who did not fear for his life.’ 2 </p>
<p>Ka f b b. Malik said: </p>
<p>553 Of them Ka'b was left prostrate there <br/>
(After his fall al-Nadlr wore brought low). </p>

<p>1 A photograph of the ruins of Ka'b’s castle is given in The Islamic Review, Sept. 1953, <br/>
p. 13 . There Dr. M, Hamidullah writes: ‘Towards the south [of Medina] in the eastern <br/>
lava plain near Wadi Mudbanib, there is a small hillock. On this the walls of the palace of <br/>
Ka'b Ibn al-Ashraf still stand, about a yard or a yard and a quarter in height, built of stone. <br/>
Inside the palace there is a well. ... In front of the palace, on the base of the hillock, there <br/>
are rims of a big cistern of water, built of.lime and divided into several sections, each con¬ <br/>
nected with the other by means of clay pipes.’ </p>

<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>THE BATTLE OF UHUD </p>
<p>I have pieced together the following story about the battle of Uhud, from <br/>
what I was told by Muhammad b. Muslim al-Zuhrl and Muhammad b. <br/>
Yahya b. Hibban and ‘Asim b. ‘Umar b. Qatada and Al-Husayn b. <br/>
'Abdu’l-Rahman b. 'Amr b. Sa'd b. Mu'adh and other learned traditionists. <br/>
One or the other, or all of them, is responsible for the following narrative. <br/>
When the unbelieving Quraysh met disaster at Badr and the survivors <br/>
returned to Mecca and Abu Sufyan b. Harb had returned with his caravan, <br/>
‘Abdullah b. Abu Rabl'a and ‘Ikrima b. Abu Jahl and Safwan b. Umayya <br/>
walked with the men whose fathers, sons, and brothers had been killed <br/>
at Badr, and they spoke to Abu Sufyan and those who had merchandise in <br/>
that caravan, saying, ‘Men of Quraysh, Muhammad has wronged you and <br/>
killed your best men, so help us with this money to fight him, so that we <br/>
may hope to get our revenge for those we have lost,’ and they did so. </p>
<p>556 A learned person told me that it was concerning them that God sent <br/>
down: 1 ‘Those who disbelieve spend their money to keep others from the <br/>
way of God, and they will spend it, then they will suffer the loss of it, then <br/>
they will be overcome, and those who disbelieve will be gathered to Hell.’ </p>
<p>So Quraysh gathered together to fight the apostle when Abu Sufyan did <br/>
this, and the owners of the caravan, with their black troops, and such of <br/>
the tribes of Kinana as would obey them, and the people of the low country. <br/>
Now Abu 'Azza al-Jumahl had been spared by the apostle at Badr because <br/>
he was a poor man with a large family. 2 He had been taken prisoner, and <br/>
said, ‘I am a poor man with a large family and great need, as you know, <br/>
so spare me,’ and the apostle let him go. Safwan said to him, ‘Now, Abu <br/>
'Azza, you are a poet so help us with your tongue and go forth with us.’ <br/>
He replied, ‘Muhammad spared me and I do not want to go against him.’ <br/>
He said, ‘No, but help us with your presence, and God is my witness that <br/>
if I return I will make you rich; and if you are killed I will treat your <br/>
daughters as my own. What befalls mine, whether good or ill, shall <br/>
befall yours.’ So Abu 'Azza went through the low country calling the B. <br/>
Kinana and saying: </p>
<p>Listen, sons of 'Abdu Manat, the steadfast, </p>
<p>You are stout warriors like your father, </p>
<p>Do not promise me your help a year hence, </p>
<p>Do not betray me, for betrayal is not right. 3 </p>
<p>Musafi' b. 'Abdu Manat b. Wahb b. Hudhafa b. Jumah went out to the <br/>
B. Malik b. Kinana stirring them up and calling them to fight the apostle, <br/>
saying: </p>
<p>O Malik, Malik, foremost in honour, </p>
<p>I ask in the name of kindred and confederate, </p>
<p>1 SQra 8. 37. 1 v.s . W. p. 471. </p>
<p>3 The sting is in the tail where islam is used in the sense of ‘betrayal’. </p>

<p>Those who are next-of-kin and those who are not, </p>
<p>In the name of the alliance in the midst of the holy city <br/>
At the wall of the venerable Ka'ba. </p>
<p>Jubayr b. Mut lm summoned an Abyssinian slave of his called Wahshi <br/>
who could throw a javelin as the Abyssinians do and seldom missed the </p>
<p>mark. He said, Go forth with the army, and if you kill Hamza, Muham- 5S7 </p>
<p>mad s uncle, m revenge for my uncle, Tu'ayma b. 'Adiy, you shall be free.' " <br/>
bo Uuraysh marched forth with the flower of their armv, and their black <br/>
troops and their adherents from the B. Kinana. and ihc people of the <br/>
lowland, and women in howdahs went with them to stir up their anger and <br/>
prevent then running away. Abu Sufyan, who was in command, went out <br/>
with Hind d Utba and 'Ikrima b. Abu Jahl went with Umm Hakim <br/>

<p>Abdu I-Dar went with Sulafa d. Sa'd b. Shuhayd al-Ansariva who was <br/>
mother of the sons of Talha, Musafi', al-Julas and Kilab; they were killed <br/>
with their father that day. Khunas d. Malik b. al-Mudarrib, one of the <br/>
women ot the B. Malik b. His! went with her son Abu Aziz b. 'Umayr She <br/>
was the mother of Mu?’ab b. 'Umayr. 'Amra d. 'Alqama, one of the women <br/>
°f thic B^ al-IIaritli 1 ,. Abdu Manat b. Kinana went out. Whenever Hind <br/>
passed Wahslu or he passed by her, she would say, ‘Come on, you father <br/>
of blackness, satisfy your vengeance and ours.’ Wahshi had the title of <br/>
Abu Dasma. They went forward until they halted at 'Aynavn on a hill in <br/>
Hie valley of al-Sabkha of Qanat by the side of the wadi opposite Medina 1 </p>
<p>• L ,, t e %° S jl e b Tc ab ° Ut ,hcm&gt; and the Muslim » ha d encamped, he 558 <br/>

<p>disliked the idea of leaving the city. Some men whom God honoured with </p>
<p>martyrdom at Uhud and others who were not present at Badr said ‘O </p>
<p>apost e of God, lead us forth to our enemies, lest they think that we are too </p>
<p>cowardly and too weak to fight them.’ ’Abdullah said, 'O apostle of God, </p>

<p>stay in Medina, do not go out to them. We have never gone out to fight an <br/>
enemy but we have met disaster, and none has come in against us without <br/>
being defeated, so leave them where they are. If they stay, they stay in an evil <br/>
predicament, and if they come in, the men will fight them and the women <br/>
and children will throw stones on them from the walls, and if they retreat <br/>
they will retreat low-spirited as they came.’ Those who wanted to fight <br/>
Quraysh kept urging the apostle until he went into his house and put on <br/>
his armour. That was on the Friday when he had finished prayers. On <br/>
that day one of the Ansar, Malik b. 'Amr one of the B. al-Najjar died, and <br/>
the apostle prayed over him, and then went out to fight. Meanwhile the <br/>
people had repented of their design, saying they thought they had persuaded <br/>
the apostle against his will, which they had no right to do, so that when he <br/>
went out to them they admitted that and said that if he wished to remain <br/>
inside the city they would not oppose him. The apostle said, ‘It is not <br/>
fitting that a prophet who has put on his armour should lay it aside until </p>
<p>559 he has fought,’ so he marched out with a thousand of his companions (583), <br/>
until when they reached al-Shaut between Medina and Uhud, ‘Abdullah b. <br/>
Ubayy withdrew with a third of the men, saying, ‘He has obeyed them and <br/>
disobeyed me. We do not know why we should lose our lives here, O <br/>
men.’ So he returned with the waverers and doubters who followed him, <br/>
and 'Abdullah b. 'Amr b. Haram, brother of the B. Salama, followed them, <br/>
saying, ‘O people, I adjure you by God not to abandon your people and <br/>
your prophet when the enemy is at hand.’ They replied, ‘If we knew that <br/>
you w r ould fight we would not abandon you, but we do not think that there <br/>
will be a battle.’ So when they withstood him and persisted in withdrawing, <br/>
he said, ‘May God curse you, you enemies of God, for God will make His <br/>
prophet independent of you.’ Someone, not Ziyad, 1 from Muhammad b. <br/>
Ishaq from al-Zuhrf, said that on that day the Ansar said, ‘O apostle, should <br/>
we not ask help from our allies, the Jews?’ He said, ‘We have no need of <br/>
them.’ Ziyad said Muhammad b. Ishaq told me that the apostle went his <br/>
way until he passed through the harra of the B. Haritha and a horse <br/>
swished its tail and it caught the pommel of a sword so that it came out of <br/>
its sheath (584). The apostle, who liked auguries, though he did not <br/>
observe the flight of birds, said to the owner of the sword, ‘Sheath your <br/>
sword, for I can see that swords will be drawn today.’ </p>
<p>Then the apostle asked his companions whether anyone could take them <br/>
near the Quraysh by a road which would not pass by them. Abu Khay- <br/>
thama, brother of B. Haritha b. al-Harith, undertook to do so, and he took <br/>
him through the harra of B. Haritha and their property until he came out <br/>
in the territory of Mirba' b. Qayzi who was a blind man, a disaffected <br/>
person. When he perceived the approach of the apostle and his men he <br/>
got up and threw dust in their faces saying, ‘You may be the apostle of </p>
<p>560 God, but I won’t let you through my garden!* I was told that he took a <br/>
handful of dust and said, ‘By God, Muhammad, if I could be sure that I </p>

<p>374 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>ja*far b. 'Abdullah b. Aslam, client of 'Umar b. al-Khattab, told me on <br/>
the authority of one of the Ansar of B. Salama that the apostle said when he <br/>
saw Abu Dujana strutting, ‘This is a gait which Allah hates except on an </p>
<p>occasion like this.’ 1 &lt; , </p>
<p>j „ 8 [T. Now Abu Sufyan had sent a messenger saying, You men of Aus and </p>
<p>Khazraj, leave me to deal with my cousin and we will depart from you, for <br/>
we have no need to fight you’; but they gave him a rude answer.] </p>
<p>'Asim b. 'Umar b. Qatada told me that Abu 'Amir Abdu Amr b. <br/>
Sayfi b Malik b. al-Nu'man, one of the B. Dubay'a who had separate <br/>
from the apostle and gone off to Mecca along with fifty young men of <br/>
al-Aus [T. among whom was 'Uthman b. Hunayf] though some people <br/>
say there were only fifteen of them, was promising Quraysh that if h e <br/>
his people no two men of them would exchange blows with him; and when <br/>
the battle was joined the first one to meet them was Abu 'Amir with the <br/>
&lt;62 black troops and the slaves of the Meccans, and he cried out, O men o <br/>
Aus, I am Abu 'Amir.’ They replied, ‘Then God destroy your sight, you <br/>
impious rascal.’ (In the pagan period he was called ‘the monk - the apostle <br/>
called him ‘the impious’.) When he heard their reply he said Evil has <br/>
befallen my people since I left them.’ Then he fought with all his might, </p>
<p>pelting them with stones. , ,. __ </p>
<p>Abu Sufyan had said to the standardbearers of the B. Abdu 1 -D ar &gt; <br/>
inciting them to battle, ‘0 Band 'Abdu’l-Dar, you had charge of our flag <br/>
on the day of Badr-you saw what happened. Men are dependent on the <br/>
fortunes of their flags, so either you must guard our standard eftcien y <br/>
or you must leave it to us and we will save you the trouble (of defending) it. <br/>
They pondered over the matter and threatened him, saying, ‘Are we to <br/>
surrender our flag to you ? You will see tomorrow how we shall act when <br/>
battle is joined’ and that was just what Abu Sufyan wanted. W hen each <br/>
side drew near to the other Hind b. 'Utba rose up with the women that <br/>
were with her and took tambourines which they beat behind the men to <br/>
incite them while Hind was saying: </p>
<p>On ye sons of 'Abdu’l-Dar, </p>
<p>On protectors of our rear, </p>
<p>Smite with every sharpened spear! </p>
<p>She also said: </p>
<p>If you advance we hug you, </p>
<p>Spread soft rugs beneath you; </p>
<p>If you retreat we leave you, </p>
<p>Leave and no more love you (586). 2 </p>
<p>The people went on fighting until the battle grew hot, and Abu Dujana <br/>
fought until he had advanced far into the enemy’s ranks (587). </p>
<p>1 In M. 166 ) the verse given by 1 . 1 . 563 follows here. n Cf </p>
<p>2 Almost the same words were used by a woman of B. Ijl at the battle of Dhu Q&lt; • • </p>

<p>Whenever he met one of the enemy he killed him. Now among the 563 <br/>
pagans there was a man who dispatched every man of ours he wounded. <br/>
These two men began to draw near one to the other, and I prayed God that <br/>
He would make them meet. They did meet and exchanged blows, and the <br/>
polytheist struck at Abu Dujana, who warded off the blow with his shield ; <br/>
his sw r ord sank into the shield so that he could not withdraw it, and Abu <br/>
Dujana struck him and killed him. Then I saw' him as his sword hovered <br/>
over the head of Hind d. 'Utba. Then he turned it aside from her. Al- <br/>
Zubayr said, ‘And I said, “God and His apostle know best.’’ ’ </p>
<p>Abu Dujana said, ‘I saw a person inciting the enemy, shouting violently, <br/>
and I made for him, and when I lifted my sword against him, he shrieked, <br/>
and lo, it w 7 as a woman; I respected the apostle’s sword too much to use it <br/>
on a woman,’ </p>
<p>Hamza fought until he killed Arta b. 'Abdu Shurahbll b. Hashim b. <br/>
'Abdu Manaf b. 'Abdu’l-Dar who was one of those w r ho w 7 ere carrying the <br/>
standard. Then Siba' b. 'Abdu’l-'Uzza al-Ghubshani, w r ho was known as <br/>
Abu Niyar, passed by him, and Hamza said, ‘Come here, you son of a <br/>
female circumciser.’ Now his mother was Umm Anmar, freed woman of <br/>
Shariq b. 'Amr b. Wahb al-Thaqafl (588), a female circumciser in Mecca. <br/>
When they closed Hamza smote him and killed him. </p>
<p>WahshI* the slave of Jubayr b. Mut'im, said, ‘By God, I was looking at 564 <br/>
Hamza while he was killing men with his sword, sparing no one, like a huge <br/>
camel , 1 when Siba'came up to him before me, and Hamza said, “Come here, <br/>
you son of a female circumciser,” and he struck him a blow' so swiftly that <br/>
it seemed to miss his head. I poised my javelin until I was sure that it <br/>
would hit the mark, and launched it at him. It pierced the lower part of his <br/>
body and came out between his legs. He came on towards me, but <br/>
collapsed and fell. I left him there until he died, when I came and re¬ <br/>
covered my. javelin. Then I w r ent off to the camp, for I had no business <br/>
with anyone but him.’ </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. al-Fadl b. 'Abbas b. Rabi'a b. al-Harith from Sulayman b. <br/>
Yasar from Ja'far b. 'Amr b. Umayya al-Damri told me: T w'ent out with <br/>
'Ubaydullah b. 'Adiy b. al-Khiyar brother of the B. Naufal b. 'Abdu <br/>
Manaf in the time of Mu'awiya b. Abu Sufyan and we made an excursion <br/>
with the army. When w r e came back we passed by Hims where WahshI had <br/>
taken up his abode. When we arrived there 'Ubaydullah said to me, “Shall <br/>
we go and see WahshI and ask him how 7 he killed Hamza ?” “If you like,” </p>
<p>I said. So we w : ent to inquire about him in Hims. While we w 7 ere doing so <br/>
a man said to us, “You will find him in the courtyard of his house. He is a <br/>
man much addicted to wine; and if you find him sober, you will find an <br/>
Arab and will get what you want from him in answer to your questions; <br/>
but if you find him in his usual state, then leave him alone.” So w r e walked <br/>
off to find him, and there he was in the courtyard of his house upon a </p>
<p>1 Lit. ‘dust coloured'. Camels of this colour were unusually large so that the speaker <br/>
means that yamza towered over his opponents. </p>
<p>376 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>carpet, an old man like a bughath (589). He was quite sober and normal. <br/>
We saluted him, and he lifted his head to look at 'Ubaydullah, and said, <br/>
“Are you the son of 'Adiy b. al-Khiyar ?” and when he said he was, he said, <br/>
“By God, I have not seen you since I handed you to your Sa'dite mother </p>
<p>565 who nursed you in Dhu Tuwa. 1 I handed you to her when she was on her <br/>
camel, and she clasped you round your body with her two hands. You <br/>
kicked 2 me with your feet when I lifted you up to her. By God, as soon as <br/>
you stood in front of me I recognized them/’ We sat down and told him <br/>
that we had come to hear his account of how he killed Hamza. He said, <br/>
“I will tell you as I told the apostle when he asked me about it. I was a <br/>
slave of Jubayr b. Mu$'im, whose uncle Tu'ayma b. 'Adiy had been killed <br/>
at Badr, and when Quraysh set out for Uhud, Jubayr told me that if I <br/>
killed Hamza, Muhammad’s uncle, in revenge for his uncle, I should be <br/>
free. So I went out with the army, a young Abyssinian, skilful like my <br/>
countrymen in the use of the javelin—I hardly ever missed anything with <br/>
it. When the fight began I went out to look carefully for Hamza, until I <br/>
saw him in the midst of the army, like a great camel, slaying men with his <br/>
sword, none being able to resist him, and by God, I was getting ready for <br/>
him, making towards him and hiding myself behind trees or rocks so that <br/>
he might come near me, when suddenly Siba' got to him first, and when <br/>
Hamza saw him, he said, “Come here, you son of a female circumciser,” <br/>
and struck him a blow so swiftly that it seemed to miss his head. I poised <br/>
my javelin until I was sure that it would hit the mark and launched it at <br/>
him. It pierced the lower part of his body and came out between his legs, <br/>
and he began to stagger towards me. Then he collapsed, and I left him <br/>
with the javelin until he died; then I came back and recovered my javelin, <br/>
and returned to the camp and stayed there, for I had no further business, <br/>
and my only object in killing him was that I might be freed. When I <br/>
returned to Mecca I was freed and lived there until the apostle conquered <br/>
Mecca, when I fled to al-Ta’if, and stayed there for some time. When the <br/>
envoys of Ta’if went out to the apostle to surrender, I was in an impasse <br/>
and thought that I would go to Syria or the Yaman, or any other country, <br/>
and while I was in this anxiety a man said to me, “Good heavens, what is <br/>
the matter ? He does not kill anyone who enters his religion and pronounces <br/>
the shahadaT On hearing this I went out of the town to the apostle at <br/>
Medina, and the first thing to surprise him was to see me standing at his <br/>
head, witnessing to the truth of God and His apostle. When he saw me he <br/>
said, “Is it Wahshi?” “Yes, O apostle of God,” I said. He replied, “Sit </p>
<p>566 down and tell me how you killed Hamza.” So I told him as I have told <br/>
you. When I had finished he said, “Woe to you, hide your face from me <br/>
and never let me see you again.” So I used to avoid the apostle wherever <br/>
he was so that he should not see me, until God took him. </p>
<p>1 A place in Mecca. </p>
<p>2 Or. perhaps, ‘Your feet looked shiny to me’. In what respect this person’s feet were not <br/>
normal is not indicated. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 377 </p>
<p>“When the Muslims went out against Musaylima, the false prophet, lord <br/>
of the Yamama, I accompanied them, and I took the javelin with which I <br/>
had killed Hamza, and when the armies met I saw Musaylima standing <br/>
with a sword in his hand, but I did not recognize him. I made ready for <br/>
him and so did one of the Ansar from the other side, both of us intending <br/>
to kill him. I poised my javelin until I was sure that it would hit the mark, <br/>
and launched it at him, and it pierced him, and the Ansar! rushed at him <br/>
and smote him with his sword, so your Lord knows best which of us killed <br/>
him. If I killed him, then I have killed the best man after the apostle and <br/>
I have also killed the worst man.” ’ </p>
<p>[When he came to Medina the men said ‘O apostle, this is Wahshi’ to S. <br/>
which he replied ‘Let him alone for that one man should accept Islam is <br/>
dearer to me than the killing of a thousand unbelievers.’] 1 </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. al-Fadl from Sulayman b. Yasar from ‘Abdullah b. 'Umar <br/>
b. al-Khattab who was present at Yamama said, I heard someone shouting, <br/>
‘The black slave has killed him’ (590). </p>
<p>Mus'ab b. 'Umayr fought in the defence of the apostle until he was <br/>
killed. The one who killed him was Ibn Qami’a al-Laythi, who thought he <br/>
was the apostle, so he returned to the Quraysh and said, ‘I have killed <br/>
Muhammad.’ When Mus'ab was killed the apostle gave the standard to <br/>
'All, and 'All and the Muslims fought on (591). </p>
<p>Sa'd b. Abu Waqqas killed Abu Sa'd b. Abu Talha; 'Asim b. Thabit b. 567 <br/>
Abu’l-Aqlah fought and killed Musafi' b. Talha and his brother al-Julas, <br/>
shooting both of them with an arrow. Each came to his mother, Sulafa, <br/>
and laid his head in her lap. She said, ‘Who has hurt you, my son?’ <br/>
and he replied, ‘I heard a man saying as he shot me, “I am Ibn Abu’l- <br/>
Aqlah, take that!”’ She swore an oath that if God ever let her get <br/>
the head of 'Asim she would drink wine from it. It was ‘Asim who had <br/>
taken God to witness that he would never touch a polytheist or let one <br/>
touch him. </p>
<p>'Uthman b. Abu Talha said that day as he was carrying the standard of <br/>
the polytheists: </p>
<p>It is the duty of standardbearers </p>
<p>To blood their spears until they are broken to pieces. </p>
<p>Hamza killed him. </p>
<p>Hanzala b. Abu 'Amir, the washed one, and Abu Sufyan met in combat, <br/>
and when Hanzala got the better of him, Shaddad b. al-Aswad, who was <br/>
Ibn Sha'ub, saw that he had beaten Abu Sufyan, and so he struck him and 568 <br/>
killed him. The apostle said, ‘Your companion, Hanzala, is being washed <br/>
by the angels.’ They asked his family about his condition, and when his <br/>
wife was asked, she said that he had gone out to battle when he heard the <br/>
cry while in a state of ritual impurity (592). </p>
<p>1 The passage in brackets is taken from Yunus’ ritvaya. It is cited from Suhayli (ii. 132 <br/>
in W. ii in loc. </p>
<p>378 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>The apostle said, ‘For this reason the angels washed him.’ Shaddad said <br/>
about his killing Hanzala: </p>
<p>I protect my friend and myself </p>
<p>With a thrust that pierces like the rays of the sun. </p>
<p>Abu Sufyan, mentioning his hardihood on that day and the help that Ibn <br/>
Sha'ub gave him against Hanzala, said: </p>
<p>Had I wished it my swift bay could have saved me, </p>
<p>And I should owe no thanks to Ibn Sha'ub. </p>
<p>It remained but a stone’s throw off <br/>
From early morn till set of sun; </p>
<p>I fought them and cried, ‘On, Ghalib!’ </p>
<p>I beat them from me with firm strength; </p>
<p>Heed not the remonstrance of others, </p>
<p>Grow not weary of tears and sighs, </p>
<p>Weep for thy father and his brothers who have passed away, </p>
<p>Their fate deserves thy tears; </p>
<p>My former sorrow is relieved <br/>
Because I killed the best men of Najjar, </p>
<p>And Hashim’s noble stallion and Mus'ab <br/>
Who was not cowardly in war. </p>
<p>Had I not slaked my vengeance on them, </p>
<p>My heart had been seared and scarred. </p>
<p>569 They retired their (Meccan) vagabonds dead 1 </p>
<p>Thrust through, bleeding, prostrate. 2 <br/>
Those not their equals in blood smote them <br/>
And those who were beneath them in rank (593). 3 </p>
<p>Ibn Sha'ub, mentioning the way he helped Abu Sufyan and defended him, <br/>
said: </p>
<p>Had I not been there and defended you, Ibn Harb, </p>
<p>You would have been left speechless for ever at the mountain foot. </p>
<p>1 Jalabib is said to mean ‘leather aprons or coverings’, as though it were the plural of <br/>
jilbab. Though Meccans exported leather, that can hardly have been matter for reproach <br/>
because leather was sent to the Negus as a gift known to be highly prized in Abyssinia, <br/>
Moreover, why should Abu S.ufyan reproach his fellow townsmen for wearing garments <br/>
which presumably differed in no way from those worn by other Meccans? It is clear that <br/>
the word is an insult, and the question is why ? Hassan’s poem (W. 738, Dhcan cxl) attacking <br/>
the muhajirs begins: </p>
<p>The Jalabib have become powerful and numerous <br/>
and I. Salul (W. 726) uses the same words to express his anger and dislike of the emigrants. <br/>
Therefore it seems that the origin of the insult is to be sought in jalab ‘a thing driven or <br/>
brought from one town to another’ indjorjalib ‘an imported slave’; and so some such w r ord <br/>
as ‘vagabonds’ is as near as one can get to the meaning. See W. Arafat, The Poems ascribed <br/>
to Hassdn ibn Thdbit, 146, where he adopts the rendering ‘tramps’. </p>
<p>1 Reading kabtbu. </p>
<p>3 The meaning would appear to be that the muhajirs were killed by negroes and brigand <br/>
mercenaries, though there may be a reference to the killing of fjamza by Wahshi. </p>
<p>379 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Had I not brought my horse back there, </p>
<p>Hyaenas or jackals would have devoured your flesh (594). </p>
<p>Al-Harith b. Hisham, answxring Abu Sufyan, said: </p>
<p>Had you seen what they did at Badr’s pool </p>
<p>You would have returned with fear in your heart as long as you live; </p>
<p>(Or you would have been killed and I should have caused </p>
<p>Weeping women to weep for you, </p>
<p>And you would not have felt sorrow for the loss of a dear one). </p>
<p>I paid them back in kind for Badr </p>
<p>On a spirited galloping prancing horse (595). </p>
<p>Then God sent down His help to the Muslims and fulfilled His <br/>
promise. They slew the enemy with the sword until they cut them off from <br/>
their camp and there was an obvious rout. </p>
<p>Yahya b. 'Abbad b. 'Abdullah b. al-Zubayr from his father from f Ab- 57° <br/>
dullah b, al-Zubyr from Zubayr said: I found myself looking at the anklets <br/>
of Hind d. 'Utba and her companions, tucking up their garments as they <br/>
fled. There was nothing at all to prevent anyone seizing' them when the <br/>
archers turned aside to the camp w r hen the enemy had been cut off from it <br/>
(T. making for the spoil). Thus they opened our rear to the cavalry and <br/>
we were attacked from behind. Someone called out ‘Ha, Muhammad has <br/>
been killed.’ We turned back and the enemy turned back on us after we <br/>
had killed the standardbearers so that none of the enemy could come near <br/>
it (596). </p>
<p>A traditionist told me that the standard lay on the ground until ‘Amra <br/>
the Harithite d. 'Alqama took it up and raised it aloft for Quraysh so that <br/>
they gathered round it. It had been with Su’ab, a slave of B. Abu Talha, <br/>
an Abyssinian. He was the last of them to take it. He fought until his <br/>
hands were cut off; then he knelt upon it and held the flag between his <br/>
breast and throat until he was killed over it, saying the while ‘O God, have <br/>
I done my duty?’ 1 He could not pronounce the dhal. </p>
<p>Hassan b. Thabit said about that: </p>
<p>You boasted of your flag, the worst (ground for) boasting <br/>
Is a flag handed over to Su’ab. </p>
<p>You have made a slave your boast, </p>
<p>The most miserable creature that walks the earth. </p>
<p>You supposed (and only a fool so thinks, </p>
<p>For it is anything but the truth) </p>
<p>That fighting us the day we met </p>
<p>Was like your selling red leather sacks in Mecca. </p>
<p>It gladdened the eye to see his hands reddened, </p>
<p>Though they were not reddened by dye (597). </p>
<p>1 Lit. ‘Am I excused ?’ </p>
<p>38° The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>57 1 Hassan also said about Amra and her raising the standard: </p>
<p>When 'Adal were driven to us <br/>
They were like fawns of Shirk 1 <br/>
With strongly marked eyebrows. </p>
<p>We attacked them thrusting, slaying, chastising, </p>
<p>Driving them before us with blows on every side. </p>
<p>Had not the Harithite woman seized their standard <br/>
They would have been sold in the markets like chattels. </p>
<p>The Muslims were put to flight and the enemy slew many of them. It <br/>
was a day of trial and testing in which God honoured several with martyr¬ <br/>
dom, until the enemy got at the apostle who was hit with a stone so that <br/>
he fell on his side and one of his teeth was smashed, his face scored, and his <br/>
lip injured. The man who wounded him was 'Utba b. Abu Waqqas. </p>
<p>Humayd al-TawIl told me from Anas b. Malik: The prophet’s incisor <br/>
was broken on the day of Uhud and his face was scored. The blood began <br/>
to run down his face and he began to wipe it away, saying the while, ‘How <br/>
can a people prosper who have stained their prophet’s face with blood while <br/>
he summoned them to their Lord?’ So God revealed concerning that: ‘It <br/>
is not your affair whether He relents towards them or punishes them, for <br/>
they are wrongdoers’ 2 (598). </p>
<p>572 Hassan b. Thabit said of 'Utba: </p>
<p>When God recompenses a people for their deeds </p>
<p>And the Rahman punishes them 3 </p>
<p>May my Lord disgrace you, 'Utayba b. Malik, </p>
<p>And bring you a deadly punishment before you die. </p>
<p> ou stretched out your hand with evil intent against the prophet, </p>
<p>'Vou blooded his mouth. May your hand be cut off! </p>
<p>Did you forget God and the place you will go to <br/>
When the final misfortune overtakes you! (599). </p>
<p>According to what al-Husayn b. 'Abdu’l-Rahman b. 'Amr b. Sa'd b. <br/>
Mu'adh told me on the authority of Mahmud b; 'Amr, when the enemy <br/>
hemmed him in, the apostle said: ‘Who will sell his life for us ?’ and Ziyad b. <br/>
al-Sakan with five of the Ansar arose. (Others say it was 'Umara b. Yazld <br/>
b. al-Sakan.) They fought in defence of the apostle man after man, all <br/>
being killed until only Ziyad (or Umara) was left fighting until he was <br/>
disabled. At that point a number of the Muslims returned and drove the </p>
<p>573 enemy away from him. The apostle ordered them to bring him to him <br/>
and made his foot a support for his head and he died with his face on the <br/>
apostle’s foot (600). </p>
<p>1 A.Dh. gives the forms Shurk and Shirk. Yaqut gives Shark as the name of a place in <br/>
the Hjjaz and Shirk as the name of a waterhole on the other side of the mountain of al- <br/>
Qunan in Asad territory. ’Ada! is a tribe of Khuzayma. </p>
<p>Sura 3. 123. 2 Reading icatfarrahum with C. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 381 </p>
<p>Abu Dujana made his body a shield for the apostle. Arrows were falling <br/>
on his back as he leaned over him, until there were many stuck in it. Sa'd <br/>
b. Abu Waqqas shot his arrows in defence of the apostle. He said, ‘I have <br/>
seen him handing me the arrows as he said “Shoot, may my father and my <br/>
mother be your ransom” until he would even hand me an arrow that had <br/>
no head, saying “Shoot with that”.’ </p>
<p>'Asim b. 'Umar b. Qatada said that the apostle went on shooting from <br/>
his bow until the bottom of it broke. Qatada b. al-Nu'man took it and kept <br/>
it. That day his eye was so injured that it lay exposed upon his cheek. 574 <br/>
'Asim told me that the apostle restored it to its place with his hand and it <br/>
became his best and keenest eye afterwards. </p>
<p>Al-Qasim b. 'Abdu’l-Rahman b. Rafi', brother of the B. 'Adly b. al- <br/>
Najjar, told me that Anas b. al-Nadr, uncle of Anas b. Malik, came to <br/>
'Umar b. al-Khattab and Talha b. 'Ubaydullah with men of the Muha- <br/>
jirun and Ansar who were dejected. He said, ‘What makes you sit there?’ <br/>
They said, ‘The apostle has been killed,’ He answered, ‘Then what will <br/>
you do with life henceforth ? Get up and die in the way that the apostle <br/>
has died.’ Then he went towards the enemy and fought until he was <br/>
slain. Anas b. Malik was named after him. </p>
<p>Humayd al-TawIl told me from Anas, ‘We found seventy cuts (T. and <br/>
thrusts) in Anas b. al-Nadr that day and no one recognized him except his <br/>
sister, who knew him by the tips of his fingers (601).’ </p>
<p>The first man to recognize the apostle after the rout when men were <br/>
saying ‘The apostle has been killed’ was Ka'b b. Malik, according to what <br/>
al-Zuhri told me. Ka'b said, ‘I recognized his eyes gleaming from beneath <br/>
his helmet, and I called out at the top of my voice “Take heart, you Mus¬ <br/>
lims, this is the apostle of God,” but the apostle signed to me to be silent.’ <br/>
When the Muslims recognized the apostle they took him up towards the <br/>
glen. He was accompanied by Abu Bakr, 'Umar, 'All, Talha, al-Zubayr, <br/>
and al-Harith b. al-Simma and others. When the apostle climbed up the 575 <br/>
glen Ubayy b. Khalaf overtook him, saying, ‘Where is Muhammad ? Let <br/>
me not escape if you escape.’ The people said ‘Shall one of us go for him ?’ </p>
<p>The apostle said, ‘Let him alone,’ and when he came near he took a lance <br/>
from al-Harith. (I have been told that some people say that when the <br/>
apostle took it from him he shook himself free from us so that we flew off <br/>
from him as stinging flies fly off a camel’s back when it shakes itself (602).) <br/>
Then, turning to face him, he thrust him in the neck so that he swayed <br/>
and fell from his horse (603). Now Ubayy, according to what Salih b. <br/>
Ibrahim b. 'Abdu’l-Rahman b. 'Auf told me, when he used to meet the <br/>
-apostle in Mecca, would say, ‘Muhammad, I have got a horse called 'Aud <br/>
which I feed every day on many measures of corn. I shall kill you when <br/>
l am riding it.’ The apostle answered, ‘No, I shall kill you, if God wills.’ </p>
<p>Now when he returned to Quraysh he had a slight scratch on his neck, <br/>
which did not even bleed. He said, ‘By God! Muhammad has killed me.’ <br/>
-They answered, ‘By,_Qod! You have lost heart. You are not hurt.’ He </p>
<p>382 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>answered, ‘He said to me in Mecca that he would kill me, and, by God, if <br/>
he had spat on me he would have killed me.’ The enemy of God died in <br/>
Sarif as they were taking him back to Mecca. </p>
<p>In reference to that Hassan b. Thabit said: </p>
<p>Ubayy showed the disbelief inherited from his father </p>
<p>The day the apostle met him in battle. </p>
<p>You came to him carrying a mouldering bone </p>
<p>And threatened him, ignorant of his office. </p>
<p>Banu’I-Najjar killed Umayya from among you </p>
<p>When he called on 'Aqil for help. </p>
<p>Rabl'a’s two sons perished when they obeyed Abu Jahl. </p>
<p>Their mother became childless. </p>
<p>Harith escaped when we were busy taking prisoners. </p>
<p>To capture him was not worth while (604). 1 </p>
<p>576 Hassan b. Thabit also said: </p>
<p>Who will give a message from me to Ubayy ? </p>
<p>You have been cast into the nethermost hell; </p>
<p>Long have you pursued error, </p>
<p>Sworn vows that you would win. </p>
<p>Long have you indulged in such hopes, </p>
<p>But unbelief leads to disappointment. </p>
<p>A thrust from an angry warrior found you <br/>
One of a noble house, no miscreant. </p>
<p>Who surpasses all other creatures <br/>
When misfortunes befall. </p>
<p>When the apostle reached the mouth of the glen 'All came out and filled <br/>
his shield with water from al-Mihras 2 and brought it to the apostle, who <br/>
refused to drink it because its evil smell repelled him. However, he used <br/>
the water to wash the blood from his face and as he poured it over his head <br/>
he said: ‘The wrath of God is fierce against him who blooded the face of <br/>
His prophet.’ </p>
<p>Salih b. Kaysan told me from an informant who got it from Sa'd b. Abu <br/>
Waqqas that the latter used to say: ‘I was never more eager to kill anyone <br/>
than I was to kill 'Utba b. Abu Waqqas; he was, as I know, of evil character <br/>
and hated among his people. It was enough for me (to hate him) that the' <br/>
apostle should say, “The wrath of God is fierce against him who blooded <br/>
the face of His prophet”.’ </p>
<p>While the apostle was in the glen with a number of his companions <br/>
suddenly a troop of Quraysh came up the mountain (605). The apostle <br/>
said, ‘O God, it is not fitting that they should be above us,’ so ‘Umar </p>
<p>1 Reading asratuhu for usratuhu (so Dr. Arafat). </p>
<p>1 According to some commentators this is the name of a well at Ufmd. The word itself <br/>
can mean a stone trough beside a well. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 383 </p>
<p>and a number of emigrants fought until they drove them down the <br/>
mountain. </p>
<p>The apostle made for a rock on the mountain to climb it. He had become <br/>
heavy by reason of his age, and moreover he had put on two coats of mail, <br/>
so when he tried to get up he could not do so. Talha b. ‘Ubaydullah 577 <br/>
squatted beneath him and lifted him up until he settled comfortably upon it. </p>
<p>Yahya b. ‘Abbad b. 'Abdullah b. al-Zubayr from his father from ‘Abdul¬ <br/>
lah b. al-Zubayr from al-Zubayr said: ‘That day I heard the apostle saying <br/>
“Talha earned paradise when he did what he did for the apostle (606).’” </p>
<p>The army had fled away from the apostle until some of them went as far <br/>
as al-Munaqqa near al-A'was. 1 'Asim b. ‘Umar b. Qatada from Mahmud <br/>
b. Labid told me that when the apostle went out to Uhud Husayl b. Jabir, <br/>
who was al-Yaman Abu Hudhayfa b. al-Yaman, and Thabit b. Waqsh <br/>
were sent up into the forts with the women and children. They were both <br/>
old men and one said to the other, ‘What are you waiting for, confound <br/>
you ? Neither of us will live much longer. 2 We are certain to die today or <br/>
tomorrow, so let us take our swords and join the apostle. Perhaps God will <br/>
grant us martyrdom with him.’ So they took their swords and sallied out <br/>
until they mingled with the army. No one knew anything about them. <br/>
Thabit was killed by the polytheists and Husayl by the swords of the Mus¬ <br/>
lims, who killed him without recognizing him. Hudhayfa said, ‘It is my <br/>
father.’ They said, ‘By God, we did not know' him,’ and they spoke the <br/>
truth. Hudhayfa said, ‘May God forgive you, for He is most compassion¬ <br/>
ate.’ The apostle wanted to pay his blood-money, but Hudhayfa gave it <br/>
as alms to the Muslims and that increased his favour w'ith the apostle. </p>
<p>'Asim also told me that a man called Hatib b. Umayya b, Rafi', who had 578 <br/>
a son called Yazid, was grievously wounded at Uhud and w-as brought to <br/>
his people’s settlement at the point of death. His kinsmen gathered round <br/>
and the men and w r omen began to say to him, ‘Good news of the garden <br/>
(of paradise), O son of Hatib.’ Now Hatib w r as an old man who had lived <br/>
long in the heathen period and his hypocrisy appeared then, for he said, <br/>
‘What good news do you give him? Of a garden of rue? 3 By God, you <br/>
have robbed this man of his life by your deception (and brought great <br/>
sorrow on me.’ Tab.). </p>
<p>‘Asim told me: ‘There was a man among us, a stranger of unknown <br/>
origin called Quzman. The apostle used to say when he was mentioned, </p>
<p>“He belongs to the people of hell.” On the day of Uhud he fought fiercely <br/>
and killed seven or eight polytheists single-handed, he being a stout <br/>
warrior. He was disabled by wounds and carried to the quarter of B. </p>
<p>Zafar. The Muslims began to say to him, “You have done gallantly, Quz¬ <br/>
man, be of good cheer!” “Why should I,” he said, “I only fought for the <br/>
honour of my people; but for th^t I should not have fought.” And when </p>
<p>A place near Medina. 2 Only as long as a donkey’s drink. </p>
<p>3 The dead were buried with rue at their feet at this time. See Waqidi B M MS A <br/>

<p>3 g 4 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>the pain of his wounds became unbearable he took an arrow from his <br/>
quiver, (T. cut the veins of his wrist, and bled to death. When the apostle <br/>
was told of this he said “I testify that I am truly God’s apostle’ 5 ).’ 1 </p>
<p>Among those killed at Uhud was (T. the Jew) Mukhayrlq who was one <br/>
of the B. Tha'Iaba b. al-Fityun. On that day he addressed the Jews saying: <br/>
‘You know that it is your duty to help Muhammad, 5 and when they replie <br/>
that it was the Sabbath day, he said, ‘You will have no Sabbath,’ and taking <br/>
his sword and accoutrements, he said that if he was slain his property was <br/>
to go to Muhammad, who could deal with it as he liked. Then he joined <br/>
the apostle and fought with him until he was killed. I have heard that the <br/>
apostle said, ‘Mukhayrlq is the best of the Jews.’ </p>
<p>579 Al-Harith b. Suwayd b. Samit was a hypocrite. He went out with the <br/>
Muslims to Uhud, and when the armies met he attacked al-Mujadhdhar b <br/>
Dhiyad al-Balawi and Qays b. Zayd, one of the B. Dubay'a, and killed <br/>
them. Then he joined the Quraysh in Mecca. Now the apostle, as they <br/>
say had ordered ‘Umar to kill him if he got the better of him, but he <br/>
escaped him and was in Mecca, Then he sent to his brother al-Julas desir¬ <br/>
ing forgiveness so that he might return to his people, and God sent down <br/>
concerning him, as I have heard on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbas: How can <br/>
God guide a people who have disbelieved after their belief, and after that <br/>
they have testified that the apostle is true and proofs have been given to <br/>
them. God will not guide an evil people’ 2 to the end of the passage (607). </p>
<p>Mu'adh b. ‘Afra’ had killed Suwayd b. al-Samit treacherously m some <br/>
other battle. He shot him with an arrow and killed him before the day of </p>
<p>Al-Husayn b. ‘Abdu’l-Rahman b. ‘Amr b. Sa‘d b. Mu'adh from Abu <br/>
Sufyan client of Ibn Abu Ahmad from Abu Hurayra said that he used to <br/>
say: ‘Tell me about a man who entered paradise never having prayed in his <br/>
580 life,’ and when the people did not know, they asked him who it. was and he <br/>
said, ‘Usayrim of the B. ‘Abdu’l-Ashhal, ‘Amr b. Thabit b. Waqsh. Al- <br/>
Husayn asked Mahmud b. Asad what were the facts of Usayrim, and he <br/>
replied that in spite of his people he had refused to accept Islam, but on the <br/>
day that the apostle marched out to Uhud he accepted it. He took his <br/>
sword, plunged into the heart of the battle, and fought until he was over¬ <br/>
come by wounds. While the B. ‘Abdu’l-Ashhal were looking for their_ dead <br/>
in the battle suddenly they came upon him and marvelled that he should <br/>
be there when they had left him showing his dislike for Islam. They ashed </p>

does!not mention him among those slain a. Uhud. He further,tssern= th. <br/>
had killed Suwayd before Islam. The emphatic way in which I.I. states that Mu adh kilie <br/>

repeated by I.H. but stuck to his guns. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 385 </p>
<p>him what had brought him, whether it was concern for his people or good¬ <br/>
will towards Islam. He replied that it was the latter. ‘I believed in God <br/>
and His apostle and became a Muslim, Then I took my sword and fought <br/>
with the apostle until I met the fate you see.’ Soon afterwards he died in <br/>
their hands. When they mentioned him to the apostle he said, ‘Verily, he <br/>
belongs to the people of paradise.’ </p>
<p>My father Ishaq from shaykhs of the B. Salama told me that ‘Amr b. <br/>
al-Jamuh was a man who was very lame. He had four lion-like sons who <br/>
were present at the apostle’s battles. On the day of Uhud they wanted to <br/>
detain him, saying that God had excused him. He came to the apostle and <br/>
told him that his sons wanted to keep him back and prevent his joining the <br/>
army, ‘Yet by God, I hope to tread the heavenly garden despite my lame¬ <br/>
ness.’ The apostle said, ‘God has excused you, and Jihad is not incumbent <br/>
on youand to his sons he said, ‘You need not prevent him; perhaps God <br/>
will favour him with martyrdom,’ so he went along with him and was <br/>
killed at Uhud. </p>
<p>According to what Salih b. Kaysan told me, Hind d. ‘Utba and the 581 <br/>
women with her stopped to mutilate the apostle’s dead companions. They <br/>
cut off their ears and noses and Hind made them into anklets and collars <br/>
and gave her anklets and collars and pendants to Wahshi, the slave of <br/>
Jubayr b. Mut'im. She cut out Hamza’s liver and chewed it, but she was <br/>
not able to swallow it and thre^ it away. 1 Then she mounted a high rock <br/>
and shrieked at the top of her voice: </p>
<p>We have paid you back for Badr </p>
<p>And a war that follows a war is always violent. </p>
<p>I could not bear the loss of ‘Utba </p>
<p>Nor my brother and his uncle and my first-born. </p>
<p>I have slaked my vengeance and fulfilled my vow. </p>
<p>You, O Wahshi, have assuaged the burning in my breast. </p>
<p>I shall thank Wahshi as long as I live <br/>
Until my bones rot in the grave. </p>
<p>Hind d. Uthatha b. 'Abbad b. al-Muttalib answered her: </p>
<p>You were disgraced at Badr and after Badr, </p>
<p>O daughter of a despicable man, great only in disbelief. </p>
<p>God brought on you in the early dawn <br/>
Tall and white-skinned men from Hashim, </p>
<p>Everyone slashing with his sharp sword: </p>
<p>Hamza my lion and 'All my falcon. </p>
<p>When Shayba and your father planned to attack me <br/>
They reddened their breasts with blood. </p>
<p>Your evil vow was the worst of vows (608). </p>
<p>1 This seems to be a survival of prehistoric animism. By devouring an enemy’s liver it was <br/>
hoped to absorb his strength. </p>
<p>B 4080 C C </p>
<p>386 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Hind d. 'Utba also said: </p>
<p>I slaked my vengeance on Hamza at Uhud. </p>
<p>I split his belly to get at his liver. </p>
<p>This took from me what I had felt <br/>
Of burning sorrow and exceeding pain. </p>
<p>War will hit you exceeding hard <br/>
Coming upon you as lions advance. </p>
<p>582 Salih b. Kaisan told me that he was told that 'Umar said to Hassan, ‘O <br/>
Ibn al-Furay'a (609), I wish you had heard what Hind said and seen her <br/>
arrogance as she stood upon a rock uttering her taunts against us, remind¬ <br/>
ing us of what she had done to Hamza.’ Hassan replied, ‘I was looking at <br/>
the lance as it fell, while I was on the top of Fari”—meaning his fort—‘and <br/>
I realized that it was not one of the weapons of the Arabs. It seemed to me <br/>
as though it was directed at Hamza, but I was not sure. But recite me some <br/>
of her verse: I will rid you of her.’ So 'Umar quoted some of what she <br/>
said and Hassan said: </p>
<p>The vile woman was insolent: her habits were vile; </p>
<p>Seeing that disbelief accompanied her insolence (610). </p>
<p>Al-Hulays b. Zabban, brother of the B. al-Harith b. 'Abdu Manat, who <br/>
was then chief of the black troops, passed by Abu Sufyan as he was striking <br/>
the side of Hamza’s mouth with the point of his spear saying, ‘Taste that, <br/>
you rebel.’ Hulays exclaimed, ‘O B. Kinana, is this the chief of Quraysh <br/>
acting thus with his dead cousin as you see?’ He said, ‘Confound you. <br/>
Keep the matter quiet, for it was a slip.’ </p>
<p>When Abu Sufyan wanted to leave he went to the top of the mountain <br/>
and shouted loudly saying, ‘You have done a fine work; victory in w&amp;r goes <br/>
by turns. Today in exchange for the day (T. of Badr). Show your superior¬ <br/>
ity, Hubal,’ i.e. vindicate your religion. The apostle told 'Umar to get up <br/>
and answer him and say, ‘God is most high and most glorious. We are not <br/>
equal. Our dead are in paradise; your dead in hell.’ At this answer Abu </p>
<p>583 Sufyan said to 'Umar, ‘Come here to me.’ The apostle told him to go and <br/>
see what he was up to. When he came Abu Sufyan said, ‘I adjure thee by <br/>
God, 'Umar, have we killed Muhammad?’ ‘By God, you have not, he is <br/>
listening to what you are saying now,’ he replied. He said, ‘I regard you as <br/>
more truthful and reliable than Ibn Qami’a,’ referring to the latter’s claim <br/>
that he had killed Muhammad (611). </p>
<p>Then Abu Sufyan called out, ‘There are some mutilated bodies among <br/>
your dead. By God, it gives me no satisfaction, and no anger. I neither <br/>
prohibited nor ordered mutilation.’ When Abu Sufyan and his com¬ <br/>
panions went away he called out, ‘Your meeting-place is Badr next year,’ <br/>
The apostle told one of his companions to say, ‘Yes, it is an appointment <br/>
between us.’ </p>
<p>Then the apostle sent 'All to follow the army and see what they were </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 387 </p>
<p>doing and what their intentions were. If they were leading their horses <br/>
and riding their camels they would be making for Mecca; but if they were <br/>
riding the horses and driving the camels they w'ould be making for Medina. </p>
<p>T S d he S y the ? make for Medina I will go to them there. Then </p>
<p>I will fight them. All said that he followed their tracks and saw what they <br/>
were doing. They w^ere leading their horses, riding their camels and going <br/>
towards Mecca. (T. The apostle had said ‘Whatever they do, keep silent T 1410 <br/>
about it until you come to me.’ When I saw they had set out for Mecca I <br/>
came back shouting. I could not hide the fact as the apostle had ordered </p>
<p>me because of my joy at seeing them going to Mecca and thus avoiding <br/>
Medina.) 6 </p>
<p>The people searched for their dead, and the apostle said, according to <br/>
what Muhammad b. 'Abdul-Rahman b. AbG Sa'saa al-Mazini, Mother <br/>
of the B. al-Najjar told me, ‘Who will find out for me what has happened to <br/>
ba d b. al-Rabi . Is he alive or among the dead ?’ One of the Ansar volun- <br/>
teered and found him lying wounded among the slain, at the point of death. </p>
<p>He told him that the apostle had ordered him to see if he was alive or <br/>
among the dead. He said, ‘I am among the dead. Convey my greetings to <br/>
the apostle and say: “Sa'd says to you ‘May God reward yoJ by us better 584 <br/>
than he has rewarded any prophet by his people,”’ and give your people a <br/>
greeting from me and say “You have no excuse with God if anything has <br/>
happened to your prophet while you can flutter an eyelid,’” and straight- <br/>
^vay he died. He said: ‘I came to the apostle and delivered his message’ </p>
<p>I have been told that the apostle went out seeking Hamza and found him <br/>
at the bottom of the valley with his belly ripped up and his liver missing <br/>
and his nose and ears cut off. Muhammad b. Ja'far b. al-Zubayr told me <br/>
that when he saw this the apostle said: ‘Were it not that Saflya would be <br/>
miserable and it might become a custom after me 1 I would leave him as he <br/>
is, so that his body might find its way into the bellies of beasts and the <br/>
crops of birds. If God gives me victory over Quraysh in the future I will <br/>
mutilate 30 of their men.’ When the Muslims saw the apostle’s grief and <br/>
anger against those who had thus treated his uncle, they said ‘By God if <br/>
God gives us victory over them in the future we will mutilate them as no <br/>
Arab has ever mutilated anyone’ (613). </p>
<p>Bur a yd a b. Sufyan b. Farwa al-Aslami from Muhammad b. Ka'b al- <br/>
Qura^i, and a man I have no reason to suspect from Ibn 'Abbas told me 585 <br/>
that God sent down concerning the words of the apostle and his com¬ <br/>
panions If you punish, then punish as you have been punished. If you <br/>
endure patiently that is better for the patient. Endure thou patiently Thy <br/>
endurance is only in God. Grieve not for them, and be not in distress <br/>
at what they plot. 2 So the apostle pardoned them and was patient and </p>
<p>act Joukl b fotn h ; n ^ ", * r f , tW °” hy ‘ in ^tc S that the prophet was aware that his every <br/>
‘ rl j a Precedent for future generations. However, it is possible that the four </p>
<p>words in the Arabic text have been added. 2 S ura 16. 127. </p>
<p>388 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>forbade mutilation. Humayd al-Tawil from al-Hasan irom Samura b. <br/>
Jundub told me: ‘The apostle never stopped in a place and left it without <br/>
enjoining on us almsgiving and forbidding mutilation.’ </p>
<p>One whom I do not suspect from Miqsam, a client of ‘Abdullah b. al- <br/>
Harith from Ibn ‘Abbas, told me that the apostle ordered that Hamza <br/>
should be wrapped in a mantle; then he prayed over him and said ‘Allah <br/>
Akbar’ seven times. Then the dead were brought and placed beside <br/>
Hamza and he prayed over them all until he had prayed seventy-two <br/>
prayers. </p>
<p>According to what 1 have been told Saflya d. 'Abdu’l-Muttalib came <br/>
forward to look at him. He was her full-brother and the apostle said to her <br/>
son, al-Zubayr b. al-'Awwam, ‘Go to meet her and take her back so that <br/>
she does not see what has happened to her brother.’ He said to her, <br/>
‘Mother, the apostle orders you to go back.’ She said, ‘Why ? I have heard <br/>
that my brother has been mutilated and that for God’s sake [T. is a small <br/>
thing]. He has fully reconciled us to what has happened. I will be calm <br/>
and patient if God will.’ When Zubayr returned to the prophet and <br/>
reported this to him he told him to leave her alone; so she came and looked <br/>
at Hamza and prayed over him and said, ‘We belong to God and to God do <br/>
we return,’ and she asked God’s forgiveness for him. Then the apostle <br/>
ordered that he should be-buried. The family of 'Abdullah b. Jahsh, who <br/>
was the son of Umayma d. ‘Abdu’l-Muttalib, Hamza being his maternal <br/>
uncle, and he having been mutilated in the same way as Hamza except that <br/>
his liver had not been taken out, asserted that the apostle buried him in <br/>
the same grave with Hamza; but I heard that story only from his family. </p>
<p>Now some Muslims had carried their dead to Medina and buried them <br/>
586 there. The apostle forbade this and told them to bury them where they <br/>
lay. Muhammad b. Muslim al-Zuhrl from 'Abdullah b. Tha'laba b. Su'ayr <br/>
al-'Udhri, an ally of the B. Zuhra, told me that the apostle said when he <br/>
looked down on the slain at Uhud: ‘I testify concerning these that there is <br/>
none wounded for God’s sake but God will raise him on the resurrection <br/>
day with his wounds bleeding, the colour that of blood, the smell like <br/>
musk; look for the one who has collected 1 most of the Quran and put him <br/>
in front of his companions in the grave.’ They were burying two and three <br/>
in one grave. </p>
<p>My uncle Musa b. Yasar told me that he heard Abu Hurayra say: Abu’l- <br/>
Qasim 2 said, ‘There is none wounded for God’s sake but Gqd will raise <br/>
him on the resurrection day with his wounds bleeding, the colour that of <br/>
blood, the smell like musk.’ </p>
<p>My father Ishaq b. Yasar told me on the authority of shaykhs of the B. <br/>
Salama that when the apostle ordered the dead to be buried he said, ‘Look <br/>
out for 'Amr b. al-Jamuh and ‘Abdullah b. *Amr b. Haram; they were <br/>
close friends in this world, so put them in one grave.’ (T. When Mu'awiya <br/>
dug the canal and they were exhumed they were as free from rigor mortis <br/>
1 i.e. learned. 2 i.e. Muhammad. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad ^89 </p>
<p>as though buried but yesterday.) Then the apostle went back on his way <br/>
to Medina and there met him Hamna d. Jahsh, so I have been told. As she <br/>
met the army she was told of the death of her brother 'Abdullah and she <br/>
exclaimed, We belong to God and to God we return,’ and asked forgive¬ <br/>
ness for him. Then she was told of the death of her maternal uncle Hamza, <br/>
and uttered the same words. Then she was told of the death of her hus¬ <br/>
band Mus'ab b. 'Umayr and she shrieked and wailed. The apostle said: </p>
<p>The woman’s husband holds a special place with her, as you can see from <br/>
her self-control at the death of her brother and uncle and her shrieking <br/>
over her husband.’ 6 </p>
<p>The apostle passed by one of the settlements of the Ansar of the B. <br/>
Abdu 1 -AshhaI and Zafar and he heard the sound of weeping and wailing <br/>
over the dead. The apostle’s eyes filled with tears and he wept and said <br/>
But there are no weeping women for Hamza.’ When Sa‘d b. Mu'adh and <br/>
IJsayd b. Hudayr came back to the quarter, they ordered their women to 587 <br/>
gird themselves and go and weep for the apostle’s uncle. </p>
<p>Hakim b. Hakim b. 'Abbad b. IJunayf from a man of the B. 'Abdu’l- <br/>
Ashhal told me: ‘When the apostle heard their weeping over Hamza at the <br/>
door of his mosque he said “Go home; may God have mercy on you; you <br/>
have been a real help by your presence” ’ (614). </p>
<p>Abdu’l-Wahid b. Abu 'Aun from Isma'il b. Muhammad from Sa'd b. </p>
<p>Abu Waqqas told me that the apostle passed by a woman of the B. Dinar <br/>
whose husband, brother, and father had been killed at Uhud, and when <br/>
she was told of their death she asked what had happened to the apostle, <br/>
and when they replied that thanks to God he was safe, she asked that she <br/>
might see him for herself. When he was pointed out to her she said, ‘Every <br/>
misfortune now that you are safe is negligible’ (using the word jalal in the <br/>
sense of‘small’) (61 &lt;;). </p>
<p>When the.apostle rejoined his family he handed his sword to his daughter 588 <br/>
Fatima, saying, ‘Wash the blood from this, daughter, for by God it has <br/>
served me well today.’ 'All also handed her his sword and said, ‘This one <br/>
too, wash the blood from it, for by God it has served me well today ’ The <br/>
apostle said, ‘If you have fought well, Sahl b. Hunayf and Abu Dujana <br/>
fought well with you’ (616). </p>
<p>The battle was fought on the sabbath in mid-Shawwal; : and on the <br/>
morning of Sunday the 16th of the month the apostle’s crier called to the <br/>
men to go in pursuit of the enemy and announced that none should go out <br/>
wuth us unless he had been present at the battle on the preceding day. </p>
<p>Jabir b. 'Abdullah b. 'Amr b. Haram said, ‘O apostle of God, my father left <br/>
me behind to look after my seven sisters, saying that it w^as not right for us <br/>
both to leave the women without a man and that he was not one to give me <br/>
the precedence in fighting with the apostle. So I stayed behind to look <br/>
after them.’ The apostle gave him permission to go and he went out with <br/>
him. The apostle merely marched out as a demonstration against the </p>

<p>390 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>enemy to let them know that he was pursuing them so that they might <br/>
think he %vas in strength, and that their losses had not weakened them <br/>
'Abdullah b. Kharija b. Zayd b. Thabit from Abu’l-Sa’ib, a freed slave <br/>
of 'A’isha d. 'Uthman, told me that one of the apostle’s companions from <br/>
rgo the B. 'Abdul-Ashhal who had been present at Uhud said, 'I and one of <br/>
my brothers were present at Uhud and we came back wounded. Wien the <br/>
apostle’s crier announced that we must pursue the enemy, I sai to my <br/>
brother or he said to me, ‘Are we going to stay away from an expedition wit <br/>
the apostle ? We have no beast to ride and are severely wounded. However, <br/>
we marched out with the apostle and since my wound was less severe, w en <br/>
he was enfeebled I put him on the beast for a time and we walked and rode <br/>
turn and turn about until we came up to where the Muslims had halte . </p>
<p>The apostle went as far as HamraVl-Asad, about eight miles from <br/>
Medina (617). He stayed the Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, and </p>
<p>then returned to Medina. _ </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr told me that Ma'bad b. Abu Ma bad al-Khuza 1 <br/>
passed by him. The Khuza'a, both their Muslims and polytheists, were <br/>
confidants of the apostle in Tihama, they having agreed that they would <br/>
not conceal from him anything that happened there. Now at this time <br/>
Ma'bad was a polytheist and he said, ‘Muhammad, we are distressed at <br/>
what has happened to you [T. with your companions] and we wish that <br/>
God would preserve you among them.’ Then he went out while the apostle <br/>
was in Hamra’u’l-Asad until he met Abu Sufyan and his men in al-Rauha <br/>
when they had determined to come back to the apostle and his companions. <br/>
They said, ‘We have killed the best of his companions, their leaders and <br/>
their- nobles. Shall we then go back before we have exterminated them. <br/>
Let us return to the survivors and make an end of them.’ W hen Abu <br/>
Sufyan saw Ma'bad he said, ‘What is the news ?’ He replied, ‘Muhammad <br/>
has come out with his companions to pursue you with an army whose like <br/>
I have never seen, burning with anger against you. Those who stayed <br/>
behind when you fought them have joined him; they are sorry for what <br/>
they did and are violently enraged against you. Never have I seen anything <br/>
, QO like it.’ He said, ‘Confound you, what are you saying?’ He answered. By <br/>
God, I do not think that you will move off before you see the forelocks of <br/>
the cavalry.’ He replied, ‘But we have determined to attack them to <br/>
exterminate their survivors.’ He answered, ‘But I would advise against <br/>
that. What I saw induced me to utter some verses about them. When he <br/>
asked what they were, he recited: </p>
<p>My mount almost fell with fright at the clamour <br/>
When the ground flowed with troops of horse <br/>
Hastening with noble lion-like warriors <br/>
[429 Eager for the fray; firm in the saddle ; J fully armed. </p>
<p>1 MU is the pi. of amval 'not fully armed’. It also means ‘unsteady in the saddle , a <br/>
meaning supported by T-’s khurq. However, the first is a cliche among the poet# and lS a <br/>
synonym of tna dzil » the word that follows it. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 391 </p>
<p>I continued to run, thinking the very earth was moving. </p>
<p>When they came up with the prince who never lacks support <br/>
I said, ‘Alas for Ibn Harb when he meets you <br/>
When the plain is surging with men.’ </p>
<p>I warn the people of the sanctuary plainly <br/>
Every prudent and sensible man among them <br/>
Of Ahmad’s army—no poltroons his riders <br/>
And the warning 1 give is true. </p>
<p>These words turned back Abu Sufyan and his followers. </p>
<p>Some riders from 'Abdu’l-Qays passed him and he learned that they <br/>
were going to Medina for provisions. He said, ‘Will you take a message to <br/>
Muhammad for me ? And I will load these camels of yours tomorrow with <br/>
raisins in Ukaz, when you arrive there.’ They agreed, and he said, ‘Then <br/>
when you come to him tell him that we have resolved to come to him and <br/>
his companions to exterminate them.’ The riders passed by the apostle <br/>
when he was in Hamra’u’l-Asad and told him of what Abu Sufyan had said <br/>
and he exclaimed, ‘God is our sufficiency, the best in whom to trust (618).’ </p>
<p>Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri told me that when the apostle came to Medina 591 <br/>
'Abdullah b. Ubayy b. Salul who had a place which he used to occupy <br/>
every Friday without opposition out of respect for him personally and his <br/>
people, he being a chief, got up when the apostle sat on the Friday address¬ <br/>
ing the people and would say, ‘O people, this is God’s apostle among you. </p>
<p>God has honoured and exalted you by him, so help him and strengthen <br/>
him; listen to his commands and obey them.’ Then he used to sit down <br/>
until when he acted as he did on the day of Uhud and came back with his <br/>
men, he got up to do as he was wont and the Muslims took hold of his <br/>
garments and said, ‘Sit down, you enemy of God. You are not worthy of 592 - <br/>
that, having behaved as you did.’ So he went out stepping over the necks <br/>
of the men and saying, ‘One would think I had said something dreadful in <br/>
getting up to strengthen his case.’ One of the Ansar met him at the door <br/>
of the mosque and asked him what was the matter. He said, ‘I got up to <br/>
strengthen his case when some of his companions leapt upon me and <br/>
dragged me along with violence. One would think that I had said some¬ <br/>
thing dreadful.’ He answered, ‘Go back and let the apostle ask forgiveness <br/>
for you.’ He said, ‘By God, I do not want him to.’ </p>
<p>The day of Uhud was a day of trial, calamity, and heart-searching on <br/>
which God tested the believers and put the hypocrites on trial, those who <br/>
, professed faith with their tongue and hid unbelief in their hearts; and a day <br/>
in which God honoured with martyrdom those whom he willed. </p>
<p>PASSAGES IN THE QURAN WHICH DEAL WITH UHUD </p>
<p>Abu Muhammad 'Abdu’i-Malik b. Hisham told us from Ziyad b. 'Abdul¬ <br/>
lah al-Bakka’I from Muhammad b. Ishaq al-Muttalibl: There are sixty </p>
<p>392 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>verses in ‘The Family of Imran’ 1 which God sent down concerning the <br/>
day of Uhud in which there is a description of what happened on that day <br/>
and the blame of those who merited His rebuke. </p>
<p>God said to His prophet: ‘And when you went forth early from your <br/>
family you assigned to the believers positions for the fighting, God hearing <br/>
(and) knowing’ (619). ‘Hearing’ what you said; ‘knowing’ about what you <br/>
were concealing. </p>
<p>‘When two parties of you thought they would fail,’ i.e. of deserting; and <br/>
the two parties were the B. Salima b. Jusham b. al-Khazraj and the B. <br/>
HSritha b. al-Nablt of al-Aus, they being the two wings. </p>
<p>593 God said: ‘And God was their friend,’ i.e. God protected them from the <br/>
cowardice they meditated because it was only the result of weakness and <br/>
feebleness which overcame them, not doubt in their religion, so He thrust <br/>
that from them in His mercy and pardon so that they were saved from <br/>
their weakness and feebleness and stuck to their prophet (620). </p>
<p>God said: ‘Upon God let the believers rely,’ i.e. the believer who is <br/>
Weak let him rely on Me and ask My help. I will help him in his affair and <br/>
protect him until I bring him to his appointed time of life and ward off evil <br/>
from him and strengthen him in his purpose. </p>
<p>‘God helped you at Badr when you were contemptible, so fear God that <br/>
you may be thankful,’ i.e. fear Me, for that is gratitude for My kindness. </p>
<p>‘God helped you at Badr’ when your numbers and strength were inferior <br/>
‘when thou didst say to the believers: “Is it not enough for you that your <br/>
Lord reinforced you with three thousand angels sent down? Nay, if you <br/>
are steadfast and fear God and they come on you suddenly your Lord will <br/>
reinforce you with five thousand angels clearly marked,’” i.e. ifyou are stead¬ <br/>
fast against My enemy and obey My command and they come on you reck¬ <br/>
lessly I will reinforce you with five thousand angels clearly marked (621). </p>
<p>594 ‘God did this only as good news for you that your hearts might be at <br/>
rest therein. Victory comes only from God, the Mighty the Wise,’ i.e. I <br/>
mentioned the armies of My angels only as good news for you and that <br/>
your hearts might be at rest therein, because I know your weakness and <br/>
victory comes only from Me because of My sovereignty and power for the <br/>
reason that power and authority belong to Me, not to any one of my <br/>
creatures. </p>
<p>Then He said: ‘that He may cut off a part of those who disbelieve or <br/>
overturn them so that they retire disappointed,’ i.e. to cut off a part of the <br/>
polytheists in a fight in -which He will take vengeance on them or drive <br/>
them back in chagrin, i.e. that those who survive may retreat as frustrated <br/>
fugitives having achieved nothing that they hoped to attain (622). </p>
<p>Then He said to Muhammad the apostle of God: ‘It is not your affair <br/>
whether He changes His attitude to them or punishes them, for they are <br/>
evil doers,’ i.e. you have no concern with My judgement of My slaves except <br/>
in so far as I give you orders concerning them or I change towards them </p>
<p>1 Sura 3. 117 f. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 2 93 </p>
<p>in my mercy, for if I wish I shall do so; or I shall punish them for their <br/>
sms for that is my prerogative; ‘for they are evil-doers,’ i.e. thev have <br/>
deserved that for their disobedience to Me. ‘And God is forgiving, merci¬ <br/>
ful, i.e. He forgives sins and has mercy on His slaves according to’ what is <br/>
in them. </p>
<p>Then He said: ‘O ye who believe, Take not 2 usurv, doubling and quad- 595 <br/>
ruphng, i.e. Do not devour in Islam, to which God has now guided vou <br/>
what you used to devour when you followed another religion; such is not <br/>
permitted to you in your religion. ‘And fear God, haply you may be pros- <br/>
perous i.e. So obey God, perhaps you may escape from His punishment <br/>
o which He has warned you, and attain His reward which He has made <br/>
you desire. And fear the fire which is prepared for the disbelievers,’ i.e. <br/>
which has been made a dwelling for those who disbelieve in Me. </p>
<p>Then He said: ‘And obey God and the apostle, haply you will attain <br/>
mercy’ reproaching those who disobeyed the apostle in the orders he gave <br/>
them that day and at other times. Then He said: ‘And vie with one <br/>
another for forgiveness from your Lord and a garden as w'ide as the <br/>
heavens and the earth prepared for those who fear (God),’ i.e. a dwelling <br/>
for those who obey Me and obey My apostle. ‘Those who spend (their <br/>
money) in ease and adversity and who control their wrath and are forgiving <br/>
to men, for God loves those who do well,’ i.e. that is well doing and I love <br/>
those who act thus. ‘And those who when they act unseemly or W'rong <br/>
themselves, remember God and ask forgiveness for their sins—and who <br/>
forgives sins but God ? and have not persisted in their actions knowingly,’ <br/>
i.e. if they have acted unseemly or wronged themselves by disobedience, <br/>
they remember God’s prohibition and what He has declared evil, and ask <br/>
forgiveness, knowing that none can forgive sins but He. ‘And have not <br/>
persisted in their actions knowingly,’ i.e, have not continued to disobey Me <br/>
like those who associate others with Me in the extravagance of their dis¬ <br/>
belief while they know that I have prohibited the worship of any but <br/>
Myself. ‘The reward of such is forgiveness from their Lord and gardens <br/>
beneath which run rivers, in which they will abide for ever—a fine reward <br/>
for workers,’ i.e. the reward of the obedient. </p>
<p>Then He mentioned the catastrophe which befell them and the mis- </p>
<p>jt 1 ? 6 W ^ 1Ch CamC Up ° n them and the trial (° f the faith) that was in them <br/>
and His choice of martyrs from among them, and He said comforting them <br/>
and telling them of what they had done and what He was about to do with <br/>
them: Examples have been made before your time, so go through the land <br/>
and see the nature of the punishment of those who called (apostles) liars,’ <br/>
i.e. vengeance came from me upon those who gave the lie to My apostles <br/>
and associated others with Me (such as) 'Ad and Thamud and the people <br/>
of Lot and the men of Midian and they saw what I did to them and to those 506 <br/>
m like case with them, for I was forbearing to them purely for the reason <br/>
that they should not think that My vengeance was cut off from your enemy </p>
<p>1 ° r ' &lt;in S P ite ° r - 2 V. 125, lit. ‘devour not*. </p>
<p>394 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>and mine in the time in which I let them get the better of you to test you <br/>
thereby to show you your true selves. </p>
<p>Then He said: ‘This is a plain statement to men and guidance and <br/>
admonition to those that fear God/ i.e. this is an explanation to men if they <br/>
receive guidance; ‘and guidance and admonition/ i.e. a light and discipline <br/>
‘to those who fear/ i.e. to those who obey Me and know My command¬ <br/>
ment ; ‘and do not wax faint or be sad/ i.e. do not become weak and despair <br/>
at what has befallen you ‘you being the superiors/ i.e. you will have the <br/>
victory ‘if you believe/ i.e. if you had believed in what My prophet <br/>
brought from Me. ‘If you have received a shock the (Meccan) army <br/>
received a shock likewise/ i.e. wounds like yours. ‘These are days which <br/>
We alternate among men/ i.e. we change them among men for trial and <br/>
search; ‘and that God may know those who believe and may choose <br/>
martyrs from among you, and God loves not wrongdoers/ i.e. to distinguish <br/>
between believers and hypocrites and to honour some of the faithful with <br/>
martyrdom. ‘And God loves not wrongdoers/ i.e. the hypocrites who pro¬ <br/>
fess obedience with their tongues while their hearts are firm in dis¬ <br/>
obedience; ‘and that God may try those who believe/ i.e. put to the test <br/>
those who believe, so that He may purify them by the misfortune which <br/>
came upon them, and their constancy and certainty; ‘and confound the <br/>
disbelievers/ i.e. bring to naught what the hypocrites say with their tongues <br/>
that is not in their hearts until He brings to light their disbelief which they <br/>
are concealing. </p>
<p>Then He said: ‘Or do you think that you will enter the garden when <br/>
God does not yet know those of you who arc energetic and steadfast?’ i.e. <br/>
Do you think that you will enter the garden and receive the honour of My <br/>
reward when I have not tested you with hardship and tried you with mis¬ <br/>
fortune so that I may know your loyalty by faith in Me,and steadfastness <br/>
in what has befallen you through Me? ‘And you used to wish’ for martyr¬ <br/>
dom when you were in the way of truth before you met your enemy. He <br/>
597 means those who urged the apostle to take them out against their enemy <br/>
because they had not been present at the battle of Badr before that and <br/>
longing for the martyrdom which they had escaped there. He said: ‘And <br/>
you used to wish for death before you met it.’ He says: ‘Now you have <br/>
seen it with your eyes!’ i.e. death by swords in the hands of men with <br/>
nothing between you and them while you looked on. Then He kept them <br/>
back f r om you. ‘And Muhammad is nothing but an apostle; apostles have <br/>
passed away before him. Will it be that if he dies or is killed you will turn <br/>
back on your heels? He who so turns back will not harm God at all, and <br/>
God will reward the thankful’ in reference to the men saying ‘Muhammad <br/>
has been killed’ and their flight thereat and breaking away from their <br/>
enemy. ‘Will it be if he dies or is killed’ you will go back from your religion <br/>
disbelievers as you once were and abandon the fight with your enemy, and <br/>
God’s book, and what His prophet will have left behind of his religion with <br/>
you and in your possession when he has explained to you what he brought </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 395 </p>
<p>from Me to you that he would die and leave you ? ‘And he who so turns <br/>
back,’ i.e. turns back from his religion ‘will not harm God at all/ i.e. he <br/>
will not diminish His glory and kingdom and sovereignty and power. <br/>
‘And God will reward the thankful/ i.e. those who obey Him and do what <br/>
He has commanded. </p>
<p>‘And no soul can die but by God’s permission in a term that is written/ <br/>
i.e. Muhammad has a fixed time which he will attain and when God gives <br/>
permission in regard to that it will happen. ‘And he who desires the reward <br/>
of this world We will give him it; and he who desires the reward of the <br/>
next world We will give him it and We shall reward the thankful,’ i.e. he <br/>
of you who desires this world having no desire for the next We will give <br/>
him his allotted portion of sustenance and nothing more and he has no <br/>
share in the next world; and he who desires the reward of the next world <br/>
We will give him what he has been promised together with his reward of <br/>
sustenance in this world. That is the reward of the thankful, i.e. the pious. </p>
<p>Then He said: ‘And with how many a prophet have myriads been slain <br/>
and they waxed not faint at what befell them in the way of God and were <br/>
not weak nor humiliated for God loves the steadfast,’ i.e. how many a <br/>
prophet has death (in battle) befallen and many myriads with him, i.e. a <br/>
multitude, and they w^axed not faint at the loss of their prophet nor showed <br/>
weakness towards their enemies and were not humiliated when they <br/>
suffered in the fight for God and their religion. That is steadfastness and <br/>
God loves the steadfast. ‘All that they said w T as, Forgive us our sins, O 598 <br/>
Lord, and our wasted effort in our affair; make our feet firm and give us <br/>
the victory over a disbelieving people’ (623), i.e. say what they said and <br/>
know' that that is for your sins, and ask His forgiveness as they did, and <br/>
practise your religion as they did, and be no renegades turning back on your <br/>
heels; and ask Him to make your feet firm as they did ; and ask His help <br/>
as they did against a disbelieving people. For all that they said actually <br/>
happened and their prophet was killed, yet they did not do what you did. </p>
<p>So God gave them the reward of this w r orId by victory over their enemy and <br/>
a fine rew'ard in the hereafter with what He had promised therein, for God <br/>
loves those who do well. </p>
<p>‘O you who believe, if you obey those who disbelieve they wall turn you <br/>
back on your heels and you wall return as losers,’ i.e. from your enemy, and <br/>
will lose this world and the next. ‘But God is your protector and He is the <br/>
best of helpers. If what you say w r ith y r our tongues is true in your hearts <br/>
then hold fast to Him and ask victory only of Him and do not turn back, <br/>
withdrawing from His religion. ‘We will cast terror into the hearts of those <br/>
who disbelieve, i.e. that by which I w ? as helping you against them because 599 <br/>
they associated with Me that for which I gave them no warrant; i.e. do not <br/>
think that they will have the final victory over you, while you hold fast to <br/>
Me and follow My commandment, because of the disaster which befell <br/>
you through sins which you committed whereby you went against My <br/>
commandment in disobedience and also disobeyed the prophet. ‘God ful- </p>
<p>396 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>filled His promise when you routed them by His leave until you failed and <br/>
disagreed about the order and were disobedient after He had shown you <br/>
what you were desiring. Some of you desired this world and some desired <br/>
the hereafter. Then He made you flee from them that He might try you. <br/>
Yet He forgave you, for God is full of kindness to the believers,’ i.e. I <br/>
carried out My promise to give you victory over your enemy when you <br/>
routed them with the sword, i.e. killing them by My permission and My <br/>
giving you power over them and keeping them from you (624). ‘Until you <br/>
failed,’ i.e. deserted and disagreed about the order; i.e. you disputed about <br/>
My order, i.e. you abandoned the order of your prophet and what he had <br/>
told you to do, meaning the archers. ‘After He had shown you what you <br/>
were desiring,’ i.e. victory about which there was no doubt and the flight <br/>
of the (Meccan) army from their wives and property. ‘Some of you desired <br/>
this world,’ i.e. those who desired the spoil in this world and abandoned <br/>
their orders which carried the reward of the hereafter; ‘and some of you <br/>
desired the hereafter,’ i.e. those who fought for God s sake and did not <br/>
transgress in going after what they had been forbidden for an accident 1 of <br/>
this world out of desire for it, hoping for the fine reward that is with God <br/>
hereafter; i.e. those who fought for religion and did not transgress in going <br/>
after what they had been forbidden for an accident 1 of this world. ‘To try <br/>
you’ for some of your sins. God pardoned the great sin in that He did not <br/>
destroy you for having disobeyed your prophet. But I restored My kindness <br/>
to you. ‘And thus God favours the believers.’ He punished some sins at <br/>
once in this world by way of discipline and admonition, but He did not <br/>
exterminate all for the debt they owed Him because they suffered for dis¬ <br/>
obeying Him, out of mercy to them and as a reward for such faith as they had. </p>
<p>Then He reproached them for running away from their prophet and <br/>
paying no heed when he called to them: ‘When you climbed up and paid <br/>
no heed to any one while the apostle was calling behind you, He rewarded <br/>
you with grief for grief, that you might not be sad for what you missed and <br/>
for what befell you,’ i.e. grief after grief by the killing of some of your <br/>
brethren and your enemy getting the better of you, and what you felt when <br/>
someone said your prophet had been killed. That was what brought grief <br/>
for grief to you so that you might not be sad over the victory you had <br/>
missed after you had seen him with your own eyes, nor over the death of <br/>
your brethren until I gave you ease of that sorrow. And God is informed <br/>
of what you do.’ God comforted them from the sorrow and grief which <br/>
they suffered in rebutting the lie of Satan that their prophet had been <br/>
killed; and when they saw the apostle alive among them what they had <br/>
missed from the Meccans after the victory over them and their disaster in <br/>
the loss of their brethren became easy to bear when God had turned death <br/>
aside from their prophet. </p>
<p>‘Then after grief He sent down safety for you, as a sleep. It came upon <br/>
a party of you while another party were troubled in mind thinking wrongly </p>
<p>1 A transitory and adventitious advantage. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 397 </p>
<p>about God thoughts of heathen days, saying, Have we anything to do with <br/>
the matter? 1 Say, the whole matter belongs to God. They hide in them¬ <br/>
selves what they do not reveal to thee. They say, If we had had anything <br/>
to do with the matter we should not have been killed here. Say: Had you <br/>
beeni n your houses, those whose slaying has been written would have gone <br/>
forth to the places where they were to lie. (This has happened) that God 601 <br/>
might test what is in your breasts and prove what is in your hearts, for God <br/>
knows about what is in the breasts.’ God sent down sleep in security upon <br/>
the people who were confident in Him and they slept unafraid; while the <br/>
hypocrites whose thoughts troubled them, thinking wrongly about God <br/>
thoughts of heathen days, were afraid of death because they had no hope <br/>
in the final result. God mentioned their recriminations and sorrow at what <br/>
befell them. Then He said to His prophet, ‘Say “Had you been in your <br/>
houses,” ’ you would not have been in this place in which God has made plain <br/>
your secret thoughts ‘those whose slaying has been written would have <br/>
gone forth to the places where they were to lie’ to some other place where <br/>
they would have been slain so that He might test what w r as in their breasts <br/>
‘and prove what was in their hearts, for God knows what is in the breasts,’ <br/>
i.e. what is in their breasts which they try to conceal from you is not hidden <br/>
from Him. </p>
<p>Then He said: ‘O you who believe, be not like those who disbelieved <br/>
and said of their brethren who journeyed through the land or were raiding <br/>
“Had they been with us, they would not have died or been killed that God <br/>
may make that sorrow in their hearts. God gives life and causes death and <br/>
God is a seer of what you do,”’ i.e. be not like the hypocrites who forbid <br/>
their brethren to war for God’s sake and to travel through the land in <br/>
obedience to God and His apostle and say when they die or are killed, <br/>
‘Had they obeyed us, they would not have died or been killed.’ ‘That God <br/>
may make that sorrow in their heart’ because of their lack of certainty in <br/>
their Lord. ‘God gives life and causes death,’ i.e. their earthly stay is <br/>
shortened or prolonged by His power as He wishes. Then God said: ‘If <br/>
you are slain for God’s sake or die, pardon from God and mercy are better <br/>
than what you amass,’ i.e. there is no escape from death, so death for God’s <br/>
sake or death in battle is better even if they had known and been certain <br/>
of what they would amass from the world for which they hold back from <br/>
fighting in fear of death and battle because of what they have amassed <br/>
from the splendour of this world, not desiring the hereafter, ‘If you die or <br/>
are slain,’ whichever it may be, ‘surely to God will you be gathered,’ i.e. to <br/>
God you must return. Let not the world deceive you and be not deceived <br/>
by it. Let fighting and the reward which God holds out to you have more <br/>
weight with you than that. </p>
<p>Then he said: ‘It was by the mercy of God that thou wast lenient to them. <br/>
Hadst thou been stern and rough, they would have dispersed and been no 602 <br/>
longer round thee,’ i.e. they would have left you. ‘So forgive them,’ i.e. </p>
<p>1 Or ‘order’. </p>
<p>398 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>overlook their offence, ‘and ask pardon for them and consult them about <br/>
the matter. When thou art resolved put thy trust in God, for God loves <br/>
those who trust.’ He reminded His prophet of his leniency to them, and <br/>
his patience with them in their weakness and their lack of patience had he <br/>
treated them harshly for all their opposition when there was laid upon <br/>
them the duty of obeying their prophet. Then He said: ‘So forgive them,’ <br/>
i.e. overlook their offence ‘and ask pardon’ for their sins: the people of faith <br/>
who did wrong. ‘And consult them about the matter’ to show them that <br/>
you listen to them and ask their help, even if you are independent of them, <br/>
thereby making their religion agreeable to them. ‘And when thou art <br/>
resolved’ on a matter which has come from Me and a matter of religion <br/>
concerning fighting your enemy when only that will bring you and them <br/>
advantage, then do as you have been ordered despite the opposition of <br/>
those who oppose you and in agreement with those who agree with you. <br/>
‘And trust in God,’ i.e. please Him rather than men. ‘God loves them that <br/>
trust. If God helps you none can overcome you; if He forsakes you, who <br/>
thereafter can help you?’ i.e. so that you do not leave My command for <br/>
men, and forsake men’s orders for Mine. On God, not on men, let <br/>
believers trust. </p>
<p>Then He said: ‘It is not for any prophet to deceive. Whoso deceives <br/>
will bring his deceit with him on the day of resurrection. Then every soul <br/>
will be paid in full what it has earned and they will not be wronged.’ It is <br/>
not for a prophet to conceal from men what he has been ordered to reveal <br/>
either out of fear or desire to please them. W hoso does that will bring it <br/>
with him on the day of resurrection; then he will be repaid what he has <br/>
earned not wronged nor defrauded. ‘Is one who follows the pleasure of <br/>
God’ whether men like it or not ‘like one who has incurred God’s dis¬ <br/>
pleasure?’ by pleasing or displeasing men. He says, Is one who obeys Me <br/>
whose reward is the garden and the goodwill of God like one who has <br/>
incurred God’s anger and deserves His anger, whose home is hell and a <br/>
miserable end? Are the two examples the same? So know ‘There are <br/>
degrees with God and God is a seer of what they do of all the degrees of <br/>
603 what they do in paradise and hell, i.e. God knows those who obey and <br/>
those who disobey Him. </p>
<p>Then He said: ‘God showed favour to the believers when He sent <br/>
among them an apostle from among themselves who recited to them His <br/>
verses and purified them and taught them the book and wisdom, though <br/>
before they were in obvious error.’ God favoured you, O people of the <br/>
faith, when He sent among you an apostle of your own, reciting to you His <br/>
verses concerning what you did, and teaching you good and evil that you <br/>
might know the good and do it; and the evil and guard yourselves against <br/>
it, and telling you of His pleasure with you when you obeyed Him; that you <br/>
might gain much from obeying Him and avoid the wrath proceeding from <br/>
disobedience that thereby you might escape His vengeance and obtain the <br/>
reward of His garden. ‘Though before you were in obvious error,’ i.e. in </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 399 </p>
<p>the blindness of paganism not knowing what was good nor asking pardon <br/>
for evil—deaf to good, dumb to the right, blind to guidance. </p>
<p>Then He mentioned the catastrophe that befell them: ‘And was it so <br/>
when a catastrophe befell you though you had smitten (them) with a disas¬ <br/>
ter twice as great you said: How’ is this? Say: It is from yourselves. God <br/>
is able to do all things.’ Though a catastrophe befell you in the death of <br/>
your brethren because of your sins, before that you had smitten your <br/>
enemy with double that on the day of Badr in slaying and taking prisoners; <br/>
and you have forgotten your disobedience and your opposition to what your <br/>
prophet commanded you. You have brought that on yourselves. ‘God is <br/>
able to do all things.’ God is able to do what He walls with His servants in <br/>
taking vengeance or pardoning. ‘And w-hat befell you on the day the two <br/>
armies met was by God’s permission and that He might know the believers.’ <br/>
What befell you when you and your enemy met was by My permission. <br/>
That happened when you acted as you did after My help had come to you <br/>
and I had fulfilled my promise to you to distinguish between believers and <br/>
hypocrites and to know r those w'ho were hypocrites among you, i.e. to make <br/>
plain what was in them. ‘And it was said to them, Come, fight for God’s <br/>
sake or defend,’ meaning ‘Abdullah b. Ubayy and his companions who <br/>
went back from the apostle when he weht against his polytheistic enemies <br/>
at Uhud and their words: ‘If we knew 7 that you were going to fight we <br/>
would go w'ith you and would defend you; but we do not think that there <br/>
will be a fight.’ So he showed what they w r ere hiding within them. </p>
<p>God said: ‘They were nearer to disbelief than to faith that day saying <br/>
with their mouths what was not in their hearts,’ i.e. showing you faith <br/>
which was not in their hearts ‘but God knows best about what they con¬ <br/>
ceal,’ i.e. what they hide, ‘who said of their brethren’ W'ho belonged to <br/>
their families and people who were killed in your company, ‘Had they <br/>
obeyed us they would not have been killed. Say: Then avert death from <br/>
yourselves if you are truthful,’ i.e. there is no escape from death, but if you <br/>
are able to keep death away* from you then do so. This w'as because they <br/>
were hypocritical and left fighting for God’s sake, eager to survive in this <br/>
world and fleeing from death. </p>
<p>Then He said to His prophet to make the believers wish to fight and <br/>
desire battle: ‘And do not think that those who were killed for God’s sake <br/>
are dead, nay they are alive with their Lord being nourished, glad with the <br/>
bounty that God has brought them and rejoicing in those who have not <br/>
yet joined them that they have nothing to fear or grieve over,’ i.e. Do not <br/>
think that those who were killed for God’s sake are dead, i.e. I have brought <br/>
them to life again and they are with Me being nourished in the rest and <br/>
bounty of the Garden, rejoicing in the bounty that God has brought them <br/>
for their striving on His account, and happy about those who have not <br/>
yet joined them, i.e. glad when those of their brethren join them on <br/>
account of their effort in w r ar that they will share wdth them in the reward <br/>
that God has given them, God having removed from them fear and sorrow. </p>
<p>400 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>God says: ‘Rejoicing in the favour and bounty of God and that God does <br/>
not waste the wages of the believers’ because they have seen the fulfilment <br/>
of the promise and the great reward. </p>
<p>Isma'il b. Umayya told me from Abu’I-Zubayr from Ibn 'Abbas: The <br/>
apostle said when your brethren were slain at Uhud, ‘God has put their <br/>
spirits in the crops of green birds which come down to the rivers of the <br/>
Garden; they eat of its fruits and come home to where there are golden </p>
<p>605 candlesticks in the shadow of the throne; and when they experience the <br/>
goodly drink and food and their beautiful resting-place they say: Would <br/>
that our brethren knew what God has done with us that they might not <br/>
dislike fighting and shrink from war!’ And God says ‘I will tell them of <br/>
you’ so He sent down to His apostle these verses ‘And do not think,’ &amp;c. </p>
<p>Al-Harith b. al-Fudayl.told me from Mahmud b. Labid al-Ansari from <br/>
Ibn 'Abbas: The martyrs are at Bariq, a river at the gate of the Garden, in <br/>
a green tent, their provision from the Garden coming out to them morning <br/>
and evening. </p>
<p>One whom I do not suspect told me from 'Abdullah b.dMas^ud that he <br/>
was asked about these verses *Do not think’, &amp;c., and he said, We asked <br/>
about them and we were told that when your brethren were slain at Uhud <br/>
God put their spirits in the crops of green birds which come down to the <br/>
rivers of the Garden and eat of its fruits and come home to where there are <br/>
golden candlesticks in the shade of the throne and God takes one look at <br/>
them and says ,-‘0 My servants, What do you wish that I should give you <br/>
more?’ And they say, ‘O our Lord, there is nothing beyond the Garden <br/>
which Thou hast given us from which we eat when we please.’ After the <br/>
question has been put three times they say the same, adding, ‘except that <br/>
we should like our spirits to return to our bodies and then return to the <br/>
earth and fight for Thee until we are killed again.’ </p>
<p>One of our companions told me from 'Abdullah b. Muhammad b. 'Aqil <br/>
from Jabir b. 'Abdullah: The apostle said to me, ‘I will give you good <br/>
news, Jabir. God has restored to life your father who was killed at Uhud.’ <br/>
Then He asked him what he would like Him to do for him and he said <br/>
that he would like to return to the world and fight for Him and be killed <br/>
a second time. </p>
<p>606 'Amr b. 'Ubayd told me from al-Hasan that the apostle swore that there <br/>
was no believer who had parted from the world and wanted to return to it <br/>
for a single hour even if he could possess it with all it has except the <br/>
martyr who would like to return and fight for God and be killed a second <br/>
time. </p>
<p>Then God said, ‘Those who responded to God and His apostle after <br/>
harm had befallen them,’ i.e. wnunds. They are the believers who went <br/>
with the apostle on the morrow of Uhud to Hamra’u’l-Asad in spite of the <br/>
pain of their wounds, ‘for those of them who do w'ell and are pious there is <br/>
a great reward; those to whom men said: The men (of Mecca) have <br/>
gathered against you so fear them, and that but increased their faith and </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 401 </p>
<p>they said, Allah is sufficient for us and a fine one in whom to trust.’ The <br/>
men who said that were a number of 'Abdu’I-Qays to whom Abu Sufyan <br/>
spoke. They said; ‘Abu Sufyan and his company are certainly coming back <br/>
to you.’ God says, ‘So they returned with God’s grace ahd favour. Harm <br/>
did not befall them and they followed God’s pleasure and God is of great <br/>
bounty’ in that He turned away their enemy so that they did not meet <br/>
him. ‘It is only the devil,’ i.e. those men and what Satan put into their <br/>
mouths, ‘who would make men fear his adherents,’ i.e. frighten you by <br/>
means of his adherents. But fear them not and fear Me if you are believers. <br/>
Let not those who vie in running to disbelief grieve you,’ i.e, the hypo¬ <br/>
crites, they can in no wise injure God. God wills not to assign them a <br/>
portion in the next world where they will have a painful punishment. <br/>
Those who buy infidelity with faith will in no wise injure God: they will <br/>
have a painful punishment. Let not those who disbelieve think that the <br/>
respite We give them is good for them. We give them a respite only that <br/>
they may increase in trespass. Theirs is an ignominious punishment. It <br/>
is not God’s purpose to leave the believers as you are till He shall separate <br/>
the evil from the good,’ i.e. the hypocrites. ‘And it is not God’s purpose to <br/>
let you know the unseen,’ i.e. what He wills to try you with that you may <br/>
take heed of what comes to you. ‘But God chooses whom He will of His <br/>
messengers,’ i.e. He lets him know that ‘So believe in God and His <br/>
messengers and if you believe and are pious,’ i.e. return and repent ‘then <br/>
you will have a great reward.’ </p>

<p>POETRY ON TElE BATTLE OF UHUD </p>
<p>The following wrote erses on the subject: </p>
<p>Hubayra b. Abu Wahb b. 'Amr b. <em>A</em>idh b. 'Abd b. 'Imran b. Makhzuin <br/>
(640): </p>
<p>Why does this painful anxiety afflict me at night. </p>
<p>My love for Hind beset by cares. 1 . </p>
<p>Hind keeps blaming and reproaching me <br/>
While war has distracted me from her. </p>
<p>Gently now, blame me not; ’tis my habit <br/>
As you know I have never concealed it. </p>
<p>I help the B. Ka'b as they demand <br/>
Struggling with the burdens they impose. </p>
<p>I bore my arms bestride a noble horse , , ,1 </p>
<p>Long of pace, smooth in gait, keeping up with the cavalry s gal op, </p>
<p>Running like a wild ass in the desert which <br/>
Pursued by hunters keeps close to the females. </p>
<p>Sired by A'waj, which rejoices men’s hearts <br/>
Like a branch on a thick lofty palm. </p>
<p>I got him ready and a sharp choice sword <br/>
And a lance with which I meet life’s crises. </p>
<p>This and a well-knit coat of mail like a wavy pool <br/>
Fastened on me clear of blemishes. </p>
<p>We brought Kinana from the confines of yonder lemen <br/>
Across the land driving them hard. </p>
<p>When Kinana asked where we were taking them. </p>
<p>We told them Medina ; 3 so they made for it and its people. </p>
<p>We were the true knights that day on Uhud’s slope. . </p>
<p>Ma'add were in terror so we said we would come to their ai . </p>
<p>They feared our strokes and thrusts well aimed and cutting <br/>
Which they beheld when their outposts had drawn together. </p>
<p>Then we came like a cloud of hail, </p>
<p>The B. al-Najjar’s bird of death bemoaned them. </p>
<p>Their skulls in the battle were like ostrich eggs <br/>
Split open (by the chicks) and cast aside; </p>
<p>Or a colocynth on a withered shoot <br/>
Loosened by the sweeping winds. </p>
<p>We spend our wealth lavishly without reckoning <br/>
And we stab the horsemen in their eyes right and left. </p>
<p>• So A. Dh„ but 'ddiya in 74*. 3 7 ™ans ‘troops’ and it may well be that love and war </p>
<p>are mingled in his thoughts. , 18 &lt;0 • but a comparison with 'Amr </p>

<p>The Life of Muhammad 405 </p>
<p>Many a night when the host warms his hands in the belly of a slaughtered <br/>
camel </p>
<p>And invites only wealthy guests, 1 </p>
<p>Many a night of jumada with freezing 2 rain </p>
<p>Have I travelled through the wintry cold. </p>
<p>Because of the frosts the dogs bark but once <br/>
And the vipers leave not their holes. </p>
<p>I kindled then a blaze for the needy </p>
<p>Bright as the lightning that illumines the horizon. </p>
<p>'Amr and his father before him bequeathed me this example. 613 </p>
<p>He used to do this again and again. </p>
<p>They vied with the courses of the stars. </p>
<p>Their deeds never fell below the highest standard. </p>
<p>Hassan b. Thabit answered him: </p>
<p>You brought Kinana in your folly (to fight) the apostle, </p>
<p>For God’s army was (bound to) disgrace them. </p>
<p>You brought them to death’s cisterns in broad daylight. </p>
<p>Hell was their .meeting-place, killing what they met with. </p>
<p>You collected them, black slaves, men of no descent, </p>
<p>O leaders of infidels whom their insolent ones deceived. </p>
<p>Why did you not learn from those thrown into Badr’s pit <br/>
Slain by God’s horsemen ? </p>
<p>Many a prisoner did we free without ransom, </p>
<p>Many a captive’s forelock did we, his masters, cut! (641) </p>
<p>Ka'b b. Malik also answered Hubayra: </p>
<p>Have Ghassan heard about us though </p>
<p>Wide desert land where travel is uncertain separates them ? </p>
<p>Deserts and mountains looking black in the distance <br/>
Like pillars of dust dotted here and there. </p>
<p>Strong camels there become feeble, </p>
<p>The yearly rains pass over it to make other lands fertile. 3 <br/>
There the skeletons of exhausted ai mals <br/>
Look like merchants’ linen dotted with figures. </p>
<p>The wild oxen and gazelles walk in file <br/>
And broken ostrich eggs lie strewn abroad. </p>
<p>Our warriors who fight for their religion are all troops <br/>
Skilled in war with helmets 4 shining. </p>
<p>1 The mean man does not throw the meal open to all and sundry, but invites only those <br/>
who can return his hospitality. </p>
<p>1 jumadiya. S. points out that the old names of the months indicated their position in <br/>
the solar year and that these names persisted when the months fell in different seasons <br/>
after the lunar calendar was adopted; thus Ramadan, ‘the scorcher’, could begin in January <br/>
and Rabi'a, ‘the Spring’, begin in November. </p>
<p>3 Or ‘The yearly rain clouds are empty and pass swiftly on’. </p>
<p>4 Properly the tops of the Pickelhaube. </p>
<p>406 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Every coat of mail preserved in store is <br/>
When donned as a well-filled pool. </p>
<p>614 But ask any man you meet about Badr; </p>
<p>News you are ignorant of will be profitable. </p>
<p>Had other men been in that land of fear </p>
<p>They would have decamped at night and fled away. </p>
<p>When a rider of ours came he said, </p>
<p>‘Prepare to meet the force Ibn Harb has collected.’ </p>
<p>In misfortunes that would distress others <br/>
We showed greater calmness than all. </p>
<p>Had others been beset by a multitude <br/>
They would have given up and lost heart. 1 <br/>
We fought them; no tribe could stand against us <br/>
But feared and fled in dread. </p>
<p>When they made their home in Trd 2 our leader said, </p>
<p>‘Why do we plant grain if we do not protect it?’ </p>
<p>Among us was God’s apostle whose command we obey. </p>
<p>When he gives an order w r e do not examine it. </p>
<p>The spirit 3 descends on him from his Lord </p>
<p>Brought down from the midst of heaven and taken up again. </p>
<p>We consult him on our wishes, and our desire <br/>
Is to obey him in all that he wants. </p>
<p>The apostle said when they appeared, </p>
<p>‘Cast off the fear of death and desire it, </p>
<p>Be like one who sells his life </p>
<p>To draw near to a King by Whom he will be restored to life. </p>
<p>Take your swords and trust in God <br/>
To Whom belongs the disposal of all things.* </p>
<p>We made for them openly as they rode their camels </p>
<p>Bearing swords and unafraid </p>
<p>In a compact force with lances and spears; </p>
<p>When our steeds planted their feet they kept them firm. </p>
<p>Into a sea of foemen we plunged, </p>
<p>Their blacks in the centre some in armour some unprotected. </p>
<p>They were three thousand while we were three hundred £lite <br/>
Or four hundred at the most. </p>
<p>The battle went to and fro while death ran between us. </p>
<p>We tried to get to the cistern of death before them and did so. </p>
<p>Bows of lote wood exchanged ‘presents* between us <br/>
All of them cut from YathribI wood 4 <br/>
And Meccan arrows made by Sa'id </p>
<p>1 Or, reading tawazxa'u, ‘dispersed’. </p>
<p>2 A place outside Medina. 3 i.e. Gabriel. </p>
<p>4 A.Dh. explains YathribI as ‘bow strings' cut in Medina, but the context implies that </p>
<p>arrows were exchanged. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad ^ </p>
<p>Sprinkled with poison at the time they were made <br/>
Sometimes hitting men’s bodies, </p>
<p>Sometimes glancing off shields with a clang; </p>
<p>And horsemen in the plain looking like locusts <br/>
Which the east wind brings, moving briskly in the cold. </p>
<p>When we met them and the battle was fierce <br/>
(For there is no defence against God’s decree) </p>
<p>We smote them until we left their leaders <br/>
Lying in the hollow like fallen trees. </p>
<p>From mom till eve until we recovered our strength <br/>
Our zeal was like a fire burning all in its path. </p>
<p>They fled in haste hurrying away </p>
<p>Like a cloud wisp that the wind robs of rain. </p>
<p>We went on, our rearguard coming slowly, </p>
<p>Like strong lions seeking 1 meat in Blsha. </p>
<p>We inflicted loss on you and you on us; </p>
<p>Perhaps we should have won, but what is with God is more spacious. </p>
<p>The battle waged hot between us </p>
<p>And all were made to get their fill of evil. </p>
<p>We are men who see no blame in him who kills <br/>
To guard and protect his protegees. </p>
<p>Firm in misfortunes, you will never see <br/>
Our eyes weeping over a comrade slain; </p>
<p>Warriors who do what we say </p>
<p>Nor become despondent in war’s trials; </p>
<p>Warriors who commit no atrocities in victory <br/>
Nor complain of war’s scratches. </p>
<p>We are a flame whose heat men ward off, </p>
<p>Those near it withdraw with scorched faces. </p>
<p>You taunt me, Ibn al-Ziba ra, 2 yet a party went after you <br/>
Searching for you at nightfall. </p>
<p>Ask about yourself in the summit of Ma'add and elsewhere <br/>
Who is the lowest and most shameful of men ? </p>
<p>Whom did war leave shorn of glory, </p>
<p>His face humiliated on the day of war? </p>
<p>We attacked you with God’s help and succour <br/>
Our spearheads directed at you. </p>
<p>Our lances made gaping wounds among you </p>
<p>Like the mouths of waterskins where the water gushes forth. </p>
<p>We attacked the standard-bearers, and he who hastens to mention the <br/>
standard </p>
<p>Is the first in giving praise. 3 </p>

<p>(To good and evil there is an end and both befall men. </p>
<p>Gifts are mean among them </p>
<p>And the graves of the rich and the poor are equal. </p>
<p>Every comfortable and pleasant life comes to an end <br/>
And the blows of fate play with us all.) </p>
<p>Give Hass an a message from me, </p>
<p>For composing poetry cures inward pain. </p>
<p>How many skulls on the mountain slope did you see, </p>
<p>How many hands and feet cut off, </p>
<p>Fine armour stripped from the brave <br/>
Who had perished in the battle ? </p>
<p>How many noble chiefs did we slay, </p>
<p>Their descent doubly glorious, intrepid warriors; </p>
<p>Truly courageous, noble, conspicuous, </p>
<p>No weaklings when the spears fell ? </p>
<p>Ask al-Mihras who inhabits it, </p>
<p>Between skulls and brains, like partridges? </p>
<p>Would that my elders in Badr had seen <br/>
The fear of Khazraj when the spears fell; </p>
<p>When (war) rubbed its breast in Quba’ 1 </p>
<p>And the slaughter waxed hot among the 'Abdu’l-Ashhai. </p>
<p>Then they were nimble in flight <br/>
Like young ostriches running up a hill. </p>
<p>We killed a double number of their nobles <br/>
And adjusted the inequality of Badr. </p>
<p>I do not blame myself, but </p>
<p>Had we,returned we should have made a clean sweep of them, </p>
<p>617 With Indian swords above their heads <br/>
Delivering blow after blow. </p>
<p>Idassan b. Thabit answered him: </p>
<p>The battle is over, O Ibn Ziba'rS 2 </p>
<p>(Had he been fair he would have admitted our superiority). </p>
<p>You inflicted loss on us and we on you. </p>
<p>The fortunes of war often change. </p>
<p>We thrust our swords between your shoulders <br/>
Where they drank blood again and again. </p>
<p>1 War is compared to a camel. </p>
<p>2 But the reading of the Ditvatt , xi, ‘A battle ran away with Ibn Ziba'r is better. </p>
<p>409 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>^ e made liquid to run from your arses <br/>
Like the ordure of camels that have eaten 'asal. </p>
<p>When you took to your heels* in the pass <br/>
And fled like sheep one behind the other; </p>
<p>When we attacked you boldly <br/>
And drove you to the bottom of the mountain <br/>
With companies like vast objects (?) in the plain 2 <br/>
Whoever meets them is terrified. </p>
<p>The pass was too narrow for us when we traversed it <br/>
And we filled its heights and depths <br/>
With men you cannot equal <br/>
Strengthened by Gabriel’s help who came down. </p>
<p>We conquered at Badr by piety, </p>
<p>Obeying God and believing the apostles. </p>
<p>We killed all their chiefs </p>
<p>And we killed every long-robed noble. </p>
<p>We left in Quraysh a lasting shame that day of Badr <br/>
An example to be talked of. ’ </p>
<p>While the apostle of God witnessed truly, </p>
<p>W hile the short fat people among Quraysh </p>

Stories have reached me in this crooked age. 6 <br/>
^ our heart palpitates at the memory of them <br/>
In longing and tearful sadness. </p>
<p>Yet their dead are in lovely gardens <br/>
Honoured in their exits and entrances. </p>
<p>Because they were steadfast beneath the flag, </p>
<p>The flag of the apostle in Dhu’i-Adwaj, 7 <br/>

<p>They continually smote the warriors <br/>
As they passed through the clouds of dust <br/>
Till at last the King summoned them <br/>
To a garden with thick trees at its entrance. </p>
<p>All of them proved pure in the trial, </p>
<p>Died unflinchingly in God’s religion <br/>
Like tlamza when he proved his loyalty <br/>
With a sharp well-whetted sword. </p>
<p>The slave of the B. Naufal met him <br/>
Muttering like a huge black camel <br/>
And pierced him with a lance like a flame <br/>
That bums in a blazing fire. </p>
<p>And Nu'mSn fulfilled his promise </p>
<p>And the good Hanzala turned not from the truth </p>
<p>Until his spirit passed </p>
<p>To a mansion resplendent in gold. </p>
<p>Such are (true men) not those of your company <br/>
Who lie in nethermost hell with no escape. </p>
<p>Pirar b. al-Khattab al-Fihri answered him: </p>
<p>Does Ka'b grieve over his followers </p>
<p>And weep over a crooked age </p>
<p>Crying like an old camel who sees his companions </p>
<p>Returning at even while he is kept back ? </p>
<p>The water camels pass on and leave him </p>
<p>Grumbling of ill-treatment while he is not even saddled for women. <br/>
619 Say to Ka'b, ‘Let him double his weeping <br/>
And let him suffer pain therefrom; </p>
<p>For the death of his brothers when the cavalry charged <br/>
In clouds of rising dust.’ </p>
<p>Would that 'Amr and his followers </p>
<p>And r Utba had been in our flaming meeting-place </p>
<p>That they might have slaked their vengeance </p>
<p>On those of Khazraj who were slain </p>
<p>And on those of Aus who died on the battlefield, </p>
<p>All of them slain in Dhu’l-Adwaj. 1 <br/>
And the killing of Hamza under the flag <br/>
With a pliant death-dealing lance. </p>
<p>And where Mus'ab fell and lay </p>
<p>Smitten by a sword’s quick stroke </p>
<p>In Uhud when our swords flashed among them </p>
<p>Flaming like a roaring fire </p>
<p>On the morn we met you with swords </p>
<p>1 V.S. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 411 </p>
<p>Like lions of the plains who cannot be turned back; </p>
<p>All our steeds like hawks, </p>
<p>Blood horses fiery, well-saddled. </p>
<p>We trod them down there until they fled <br/>
Except the dying or those hemmed in (644). </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. al-Ziba'ra: </p>
<p>Surely tears flowed from your eyes 1 </p>
<p>When youth had fled and the loved one was far away. </p>
<p>Far off and gone is she whom you love and </p>
<p>The camp, now removed, has robbed me of a dear one. </p>
<p>The ardent lover cannot recover what is gone <br/>
However long he weeps. </p>
<p>But let be: Has Umm Malik news of my people </p>
<p>Since news spreads far and wide </p>
<p>Of our bringing horses to the men of Medina, </p>
<p>Fine handsome horses, some reared with us, some outbom, </p>
<p>The night we went forth in great force </p>
<p>Led by one, the dread of his enemies, the hope of his friends ? </p>
<p>All were clad in coats of mail </p>
<p>Which looked like a well-filled pool where two valleys meet. </p>
<p>When they saw us they were filled with awe, 620 </p>
<p>A dreadful plight confronted them; </p>
<p>They wished that the earth would swallow them, </p>
<p>Their stoutest hearted warriors were in despair. </p>
<p>When our swords W'ere drawn they were like <br/>
A flame that leaps through brushwood. </p>
<p>On their heads we brought them down <br/>
Bringing swift death to the enemy. </p>
<p>They left the slain of Aus with hyaenas hard at them and <br/>
Hungry vultures lighting on them. </p>
<p>The Banti Najjar on every height </p>
<p>Were bleeding from the wounds on their bodies. </p>
<p>But for the height of the mountain pass they would have left Ahmad <br/>
dead, </p>
<p>But he climbed too high though the spears were directed at him, </p>
<p>As they left Hamza dead in the attack <br/>
With a lance thrust through his breast. </p>
<p>Nu'man too lay dead beneath his banner, </p>
<p>The falling vultures busy at his bowels. 2 </p>
<p>1 Or the poet may be urging himself to weep. </p>
<p>2 This unpleasant version is probably the original. For yajufna C. follows the MSS. which <br/>
have yahufna, said to mean ‘fall upon’, w'hich seems unnatural here. Another variant quoted <br/>
by C. is yafrumna ‘hover’, while N 81 ., Delectus, 68, read yajuna ‘hunger for’, which again is <br/>
unnatural. AH these variants can be accounted for by the assumption that editors wanted <br/>
to tone down the ghastly description of this early Muslim's death. </p>

<p>The spears of our warriors came on them in Uhud (as-swiftly) </p>
<p>As a well devours the ropes of the bucket. 1 </p>
<p>Hassan b. Thabit: </p>
<p>Do the spring camps make you long for Ummu’l-Walld, </p>
<p>The waste lands deserted by their people ? </p>
<p>The winds of summer and the rain of Aquarius, </p>
<p>The torrential cloudbringer, has effaced them; </p>
<p>Naught remains but the place where the fire was, </p>
<p>Round it on the ground are the firestones like doves. </p>
<p>Mention no more the camp whose people distance separates <br/>
Severing the strongest ties, and say </p>
<p>‘If there was a battle in Uhud which a fool counts a victory <br/>
The real truth w r ill some day be known.’ </p>
<p>All the Banu Aus stood firm that day, </p>
<p>High renowm was theirs. </p>
<p>The Banu Najjar were steadfast in defence, </p>
<p>None was fainthearted in the fight </p>
<p>In front of the apostle of God, they did not desert him. </p>
<p>They had a helper from their Lord and an intercessor. </p>
<p>They were faithful when you, Quraysh, 2 denied your Lord. </p>
<p>(The loyal and the disloyal slave are never equal) </p>
<p>621 With swords in their hands when the battle was hot <br/>
He whom they smote could not but die. </p>
<p>They left 'Utba and Sa'd lying in the dust <br/>
As the spears found their mark. </p>
<p>They left Ubayy laid beneath the dust by the apostle’s own hand, <br/>
His shirt wet with blood </p>
<p>When the dust they stirred up covered the people. </p>
<p>These w'ere chiefs from your leading families, </p>
<p>For every army has chiefs. </p>
<p>By them 3 we help God when 4 He helps us <br/>
Even if things are terrible, O Quraysh. </p>
<p>Mention not the slain since Hamza is among them, </p>
<p>Dead for God’s sake in true obedience. </p>
<p>Paradise eternal he lives in now </p>
<p>(The command of Him who decrees is swift). </p>
<p>1 Or, ‘a water-drawer grasps’. Noldeke, Delectus, 70, renders nazu' by profundus puteus, <br/>
but this is wrong because, according to the Taj, Lisdtt, and Qati/us, it means a shalloui well. <br/>
See further E. Braunlich in Islamica, I, 1925, 338. Alternatively nazu could mean an <br/>
habitual water-drawer. If, with some authorities, mtzu be read, then the act of drawing <br/>
water is intended. The verb ghdla means taking away quickly, destroying, devouring, <br/>
grasping, &amp;c. Thus the point of the simile would seem to be that, the spears went in and <br/>
out of the bodies as fast as a skilled water-drawer could send buckets up and down a well, <br/>
or that they went in as quickly as a well (or the act of drawing water) takes away the ropes. <br/>

<p>Every day they have been accustomed to gain the victory in battle <br/>
And the spoils of those they encountered. </p>
<p>I forced myself to be steadfast when I felt afraid 1 </p>
<p>And I was certain that glory could only be got in the forefront. </p>
<p>I forced my steed to plunge into their ranks <br/>
And drenched him with their blood. </p>
<p>My horse and my armour were coloured </p>
<p>With blood that spurted from their veins and coagulated. </p>
<p>I felt sure I should stay in their dwellings <br/>
For ever and a day. </p>
<p>Do not despair, O Banu Makhzum, for you have men <br/>

<p>When I saw war’s flames leaping over the fire stones <br/>

I was sure that death was truth and life a delusion. </p>
<p>I set my arms on a strong horse which could outrun others easily, <br/>
Docile when others go astray in the desert outrunning the best horse. <br/>
When the sweat flowed down his flanks he showed more spirit; </p>
<p>Swift as a young hart of the desert when archers scare him to run full <br/>

meaning of ‘flame’ and ‘squadron’. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 415 </p>
<p>The opinion of those who oppose Islam is misleading. </p>
<p>Do not wish for more war but stay at home, </p>
<p>The habitual man of war is blood-stained, never free of care. 1 </p>
<p>You will get such blows at our hands </p>
<p>That the hyaenas will rejoice at the lumps of meat. </p>
<p>We are men of war who get the utmost from it <br/>
And inflict painful punishment on the aggressors. </p>

<p>Had you come to the bottom of the torrent bed <br/>

<p>No unarmed cowards they; </p>
<p>They walk towards the dark clouds of batde <br/>

And the sw r ord recoil wdth blunted edge. </p>
<p>Though you threw' off Mount SaP from your backs <br/>
(And sometimes life can be prolonged and death avoided) </p>
<p>You would never be able to take revenge; </p>
<p>Time will pass the slain not paid for, 3 <br/>
Slave and free, noble, tied up like game (led) </p>

<p>We were hoping to get you all, but our knights w’ith their weapons <br/>
Chased you from us too quickly. </p>

High above the leaders, generous, white, shining; </p>
<p>Not frivolous, poor spirited, nor grumbling at life’s burdens <br/>
A sea of generosity, he never withheld gifts from a guest. </p>
<p>'ioung men of honour, zealous and serious minded, have died </p>
<p>Who in the winter when none gets his fill of milk </p>
<p>Offered the flesh of camels’topped by slices carved from its fat, </p>
<p>Protecting their guests as long as the enemy attacks. </p>
<p>Alas for the young men we have lost, they were as lamps, 628 </p>
<p>Proud, patricians, princes, lavishly generous, </p>
<p>Who bought reputation with their wealth, (for reputation is a gain) </p>
<p>Who leapt to their bridles if a cry for help was raised. </p>
<p>One who suffered misfortunes in an unrighteous age. 2 <br/>
His camels kept going over the dusty plain, </p>
<p>They went vying with each other while he was among those <br/>
Whose breasts ran with sweat so that good fortune might return to him, </p>
<p>Not the lot of him who gets the unlucky arrow. 3 <br/>
O Hamza, you have left me lonely like a branch cut off from a tree, </p>

<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>I complain to you when layers of dust and stone cover you, of <br/>
The stone we put above you when the gravedigger finished his work <br/>
In a wide space, covering it with earth carefully smoothed. </p>
<p>Our comfort is that we say (and what we say is grievous har ) </p>
<p>He who is free from life’s misfortunes let him come to us <br/>
And weep for our noble generous dead, </p>
<p>Who said and did what they said, the truly laudable, </p>
<p>W T ho always gave freely even when they had little to spare ( 49). </p>
<p>He also said: </p>
<p>Do you know the camp whose traces since you saw it <br/>
Are swept away by a mighty torrent of rain </p>
<p>Between Al-Saradih and Udmana and the channel of Al-Rauha <br/>
Ha’il ? </p>
<p>I asked it of that and it would not answer; </p>
<p>It did not know the answer. </p>
<p>Give no thought to a camp whose traces have disappeared, </p>
<p>And weep over Hamza the generous who filled the platter <br/>
When the storm blew in bitter cold and famine, </p>
<p>Who left his adversaries in the dust <br/>
Stumbling on his slender lance, </p>
<p>Who threw himself among the horses when they held back <br/>
Like a lion bold in his thicket. </p>
<p>in </p>
<p>Shining at the summit of the Hashim clan <br/>
He did not oppose the truth with lies. </p>
<p>He died a martyr under your swords. </p>
<p>May the hands of WahshI, the murderer, wdther! </p>
<p>What a man did he leave on his lance, its point deadly sharp. </p>
<p>The earth has become dark at his loss </p>
<p>And the moon shining forth from the clouds is blackened. </p>
<p>God bless him in the heavenly paradise. </p>
<p>May his entry be honoured. </p>
<p>We looked on Hamza as a protector in all the blow's of misfortune. <br/>
In Islam he was a great defence </p>
<p>Who made up for the loss of miserable stay-at-homes. </p>
<p>Rejoice not, O Hind, but produce thy tears, </p>
<p>Let flow the tears of the bereaved. </p>
<p>Weep for 'Utba whom he cut down with the sword <br/>
Who lay in the whirling dust, </p>
<p>When he fell among your shaykhs <br/>
Insolent, ignorant fellows. </p>
<p>Hamza killed them with a family who walk in long armour <br/>
The day that Gabriel helped him, </p>
<p>That fine helper of an intrepid horseman. </p>
<p>1 Or ‘mingled with’, al-labis. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 419 </p>
<p>Ka'b b. Malik: </p>
<p>Visited by care you could not sleep </p>
<p>And feared because joyous youth had been taken from you. </p>
<p>A Damn girl claimed your love, </p>
<p>But your love is Ghauri and your company is Najdl. 1 <br/>
Do not go too far rashly in the folly of love, </p>
<p>You have always been thought foolish for following its allure. </p>
<p>It is time for you to stop in obedience <br/>
Or to awake when an adviser warns you. </p>
<p>I was crushed by the loss of Hamza, </p>
<p>My inward parts trembled. </p>
<p>If Mount Hira’ had been so distressed <br/>
You would have seen its firm rocks shattered. </p>
<p>A noble prince, strong in the lofty stock of Hashim, </p>
<p>Whence come prophecy, generosity, and lordship, </p>
<p>Who slew fat-humped camels when the wind is so cold <br/>
That it almost freezes the water, </p>
<p>Who left a brave opponent prostrate on the ground <br/>
On the day of battle, with his lance broken. </p>
<p>You could see him sweeping along in steel, </p>
<p>Like a tawny strong-pawed lion, </p>
<p>The prophet’s uncle and chosen one <br/>
Came to his death—a goodly end. </p>
<p>He met his fate marked out among a people <br/>
Who helped the prophet and sought martyrdom. </p>
<p>I imagine that Hind has been told of that <br/>
To still the burning choking within her breast <br/>
How we met her people on the sandhill <br/>
The day in which happiness left her. </p>
<p>And of the well of Badr when Gabriel and Muhammad <br/>
Beneath our banner turned them back </p>
<p>So that I saw their best men with the prophet in two parties, </p>
<p>One killing and one pursuing whom he pleased. </p>
<p>There remained where the camels knelt <br/>
Seventy men, 'Utba and al-Aswad among them, </p>
<p>And Ibnu’l-Mughlra whom we smote above the neck vein <br/>
From which foaming blood gushed forth. </p>
<p>A sharp sword in the hands of the believers <br/>
Reduced the pride of Umayya al-Jumahi. 2 </p>
<p>1 The poet is addressing himself. There is a play on the underlying meaning of ghaur, <br/>
low ground, and najd, high ground. The reading fahimtka would give a sense that could be <br/>
expressed by ‘Your heart is in the lowlands and your head in the highlands’, though more <br/>
exactly the word means ‘Your return to sobriety’. </p>

in his arrogance he was wont to turn away. </li>

<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>The fugitive polytheists came to you like runaway ostriches <br/>
With the cavalry in full pursuit. </p>
<p>631 Different are those whose home is hell everlasting <br/>
And those who are eternally in paradise. </p>
<p>He also said: </p>
<p>Rise, O Safiya, be not weak. </p>
<p>Make the women weep over Hamza. </p>
<p>Be not weary in prolonging weeping <br/>
Over God’s lion in the melee. </p>
<p>For he was a strength to our orphans <br/>
And a lion of battle amid the weapons, </p>
<p>Wishing thereby to please Ahmad <br/>
And the glorious Lord of the throne. </p>
<p>He also said: </p>
<p>By thy noble father’s life I adjure you. </p>
<p>Ask those who sought our hospitality, </p>
<p>For if you ask them you will not be told a lie, </p>
<p>Those you ask will tell you the truth </p>
<p>That on nights when bones were gathered for food </p>
<p>We gave sustenance to those who visited us: </p>
<p>(Crowds 1 took refuge in our shelters <br/>
From distress in years of famine) </p>
<p>With a gift of what our rich provided </p>
<p>With patience and generosity towards the indigent. </p>
<p>The shears of war left us </p>
<p>Those whose ways we have always tried to vie with. </p>
<p>One who saw the place where the camels go to water <br/>
Would think it was black rocky ground. </p>
<p>There the best camels are broken in, </p>
<p>Black, red, and white. 2 </p>
<p>The rush of men was like Euphrates in flood, </p>
<p>Solid well-armed masses destroying all in their path. </p>
<p>You would think their glitter was the shining of stars, </p>
<p>They dazzle beholders in their commotion. </p>
<p>If you are ignorant of our importance <br/>
Then ask those near us who know', </p>
<p>How we behave when war is violent <br/>
In slaughter, severity, biting, and mauling. </p>
<p>Do we not tighten the cord round the camel’s udder <br/>
Until she yields her milk and becomes gentle ? 3 </p>
<p>1 W. has najud ‘poor women’. </p>
<p>2 White or, less likely, blackish. This word is one of the addad. </p>
<p>J In these two lines war is compared to a savage camel that is subdued by the tribe s <br/>
firmness and resource and ends to their advantage. </p>

<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>A day in which fighting is continuous, 6 </p>
<p>Terrifying, burning those who kindled its blaze, </p>
<p>Long drawn out exceeding hot fighting. </p>
<p>Fear of it keeps the base-born away. </p>
<p>1'ou would think the heroes engaged in it <br/>
Were happily drunk and inebriated, </p>
<p>Their right hands exchanging the cups of death <br/>
With their sharp-edged swords. </p>
<p>We were there and we were courageous <br/>
Wearing our badges under clouds of dust, </p>
<p>With silent fine blood-stained swords, </p>
<p>Blades of Busra which loathe the scabbard; </p>
<p>Which grow not blunt nor buckle </p>
<p>And cease not smiting if they are not held back, </p>
<p>Like autumn lightning in the hands of heroes <br/>
Overwhelming in blood heads that remain in place. </p>
<p>Our fathers taught us how to strike <br/>
And we will teach our sons </p>
<p>The swordsmanship of heroes and the spending of patrimony <br/>
In defence of our honour as long as we live. </p>
<p>When a champion passes, his posterity takes his place <br/>
And he leaves others to inherit him. </p>
<p>We grow up and our fathers perish, </p>
<p>And while we bring up our sons we cease to be. </p>
<p>I asked about you, Ibnu’l-Ziba'ra, </p>
<p>And was told that you were baseborn, </p>
<p>Evil, of disgraceful life, persistently mean. </p>
<p>You have said much 1 in insulting God’s apostle. </p>
<p>God slay you, you cursed rude fellow! </p>
<p>You utter filth, and then throw it </p>
<p>At the dean robed godly faithful one (650). </p>
<p>He also said: </p>
<p>Ask Quraysh of our flight and of theirs <br/>
That morn at the base of Uhud’s hill. </p>
<p>We were lions, they but leopards when they came. 633 </p>
<p>We cared nothing for blood relationship. </p>
<p>How many brave chiefs did we leave there <br/>
Protectors of proteges, noble in birth and reputation ? </p>
<p>Among us the apostle, a star, then there followed him <br/>
A brilliant light excelling the stars. </p>
<p>True is his speech, just his behaviour. </p>
<p>He who answers his call will escape perdition, </p>
<p>Brave in attack, purposeful, resolute </p>
<ul>
<li>Another reading is tanajjasta ‘You have behaved filthily’, which may be right. </li>
</ul>
<p>422 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad <br/>
When hearts are moved by fear, </p>
<p>Advancing and encouraging us so that we should not be disobedient, <br/>
Like the full moon that cannot lie. </p>
<p>When he appeared we followed him and held him true. </p>
<p>They called him liar so we are the happiest of the Arabs. </p>
<p>They wheeled and we wheeled, they did not reform or return <br/>
While we followed them in unwearying pursuit. </p>
<p>The two armies had nothing in common, </p>
<p>God’s party and the men of polytheism and idols (651). 1 </p>
<p>’Abdullah b. Rawaha said (652): </p>
<p>My eye wept and right well it did so <br/>
(But what avails weeping and lamentation), </p>
<p>For God’s lion on the day that they said <br/>
‘Is that slain man Hamza?’ </p>
<p>All the Muslims were distressed thereat; </p>
<p>The apostle too suffered. </p>
<p>O Abu Ya'la, 2 your pillars were shattered, </p>
<p>You the noble, just, bounteous one. </p>
<p>God’s peace on you in paradise <br/>
With everlasting felicity! </p>
<p>O Hashim, the best men, be steadfast <br/>
Whose every deed is fine and laudable. 3 <br/>
God’s apostle is patient, noble, </p>
<p>Whenever he speaks ’tis by God’s command. </p>
<p>Will someone tell Lu’ayy for me </p>
<p>(For after today war’s fortune will change, </p>
<p>And previously they haVe known and tasted of <br/>
Our fighting in which vengeance was slaked), </p>
<p>You have forgotten our blows at Badr’s pool <br/>
When swift death came to you, </p>
<p>The morn that Abu Jahl lay prostrate, </p>
<p>The vultures wheeling and circling over him. </p>
<p>f Utba and his son fell together </p>
<p>And Shayba whom the polished sword bit. </p>
<p>We left Umayya stretched on the ground, </p>
<p>A huge lance in his belly. </p>
<p>Ask the skulls of Banu Rabi’a, </p>
<p>For our swords were notched by them. </p>
<p>Weep, O Hind, grow not weary, </p>
<p>For you are the bereaved one in tears for a lost son. </p>

<p>Show not joy at Hamza’s death, O Hind, </p>
<p>For your boasting is contemptible. </p>
<p>Ka'b b. Malik said: </p>
<p>Say to Quraysh despite their distance, </p>
<p>Do you boast of what you have not won ? </p>
<p>You boast of the slain on whom the favours <br/>
Of Him who grants the best favours have fallen. </p>
<p>They dwell in gardens and have left waiting for you <br/>
Lions who protect their cubs, </p>
<p>To fight for their religion, in their midst <br/>
A prophet who never recedes from the truth. </p>
<p>Ma'add attacked him with infamous words <br/>
And the arrows of enmity unceasingly (653). </p>
<p>Dirar b. al-Khattab: </p>
<p>What ails thine eye which sleeplessness affects <br/>
As though pain were in thine eyelids ? </p>
<p>Is it for the loss of a friend whom you hold dear <br/>
Parted by distance and foes ? </p>
<p>Or is it because of the mischief of a useless people <br/>
When wars blaze with burning heat ? </p>
<p>They cease not from the error they have committed. </p>
<p>Woe to them! No helper have they from Lu’ayy. </p>
<p>We adjured them all by God, 6 5 3 </p>
<p>But neither kinship nor oaths deterred them; </p>
<p>Till finally when they determined on war against us <br/>
And injustice and bad feeling had grown strong, </p>
<p>We attacked them with an army <br/>
Flanked by helmeted strong mailed men <br/>
And slender horses sweeping along with warriors <br/>
Like kites, so smooth was their gait; </p>
<p>An army which Sakhr 1 led and commanded <br/>
Like an angry lion of the jungle tearing his prey. </p>
<p>Death brought out a people from their dwellings, </p>
<p>We and they met at Uhud. </p>
<p>Some of them were left stone dead </p>
<p>Like goats which the hail has frozen to the cold ground. </p>
<p>Noble dead, the Banu’bNajjar in their midst </p>
<p>And Mus'ab with broken pieces of our shafts around him </p>
<p>And Hamza the chief, prostrate, his widow going round him. </p>
<p>His nose and liver had been cut away. It was <br/>
As if when he fell he bled beneath the dust <br/>
Transfixed by a lance on which the blood had dried. </p>

In mourning garb rent in pieces. </p>

<p>THE DAY OF AL-RAjf, A.H. 3 </p>
<p>Abu Muhammad/Abdu’l-Malik b. Hisham told us from Ziyad b. 'Abdul¬ <br/>
lah al-Bakka’i from I. Ishaq from 'Asim b. 'Umar b. Qatada: After Uhud <br/>
a number of 'Adal and al-Qara came to the apostle (659). They said that <br/>
some of them had already accepted Islam and they asked him to send some <br/>
of his companions to instruct them in religion and to teach them to read <br/>
the Quran and to teach them the laws of Islam. The apostle sent the <br/>
following six of his companions.-Marthad b. Abu Marthad al-Ghanawi, <br/>
an ally of Hamza; Khalid b. al-Bukayr al-Laythl, an ally of B. 'Adly b. <br/>
Ka'b; 'Asim b. Thabit b. Abu’I-Aqlah, brother of B. 'Amr b. 'Auf b. <br/>
Malik b. al-Aus; Khubayb b. 'Adly, brother of B. Jahjaba b. Kulfa b. <br/>
'Amr b. 'Auf; Zayd b. al-Dathinna b. Mu'awiya, brother of B. Bayada b. <br/>
'Amr b. Zurayq b. 'Abdu Haritha b. Malik b. Ghadb b. Jusham b. al- <br/>
Khazraj; and 'Abdullah b. Tariq, ally of B. Zafar b. al-Khazraj b. 'Amr b. <br/>
Malik b. al-Aus. </p>
<p>The apostle put Marthad in command of them and the band got as far as <br/>
al-Rajf, a watering-place of Hudhayl in a district of the Hijaz at the upper <br/>
part of al-Had’a. 1 There they betrayed them and summoned Hudhayl <br/>
against them. While they were off their guard sitting with their baggage <br/>
suddenly they were set upon by men with swords in their hands, so they <br/>
took their swords to fight them; but the men said that it was not their <br/>
intention to kill them; they wanted to get something for them from the <br/>
639 people of Mecca. They swore by God that they would not kill them. </p>
<p>Marthad, Khalid, and 'Asim said: ‘By God, we will never accept an <br/>
undertaking and agreement from a polytheist.’ 'Asim said: </p>
<p>No weakling I, an archer bold, </p>
<p>My bow thick-stringed with trusty hold </p>
<p>Broad arrows can life’s coil unfold. </p>
<p>Death’s certain—life a mere tale told. </p>
<p>What God decrees men shall behold, </p>
<p>Life must return to Him its mould. </p>
<p>I fight though I leave a mother, cold (660). </p>
<p>He also said: </p>
<p>I’m Abu Sulayman with al-Muq'ad’s shafts. 2 </p>
<p>Like Gehenna they burn my feathered shafts. </p>
<p>1 Between 'Asfan and Mecca; according to others between Mecca and al-T»’if- <br/>
1 A Meccan who was famed for feathering arrows skilfully. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 427 </p>
<p>When battle’s abroad I am not afraid/ </p>
<p>With shield of smooth ox-hide I’m safely arrayed <br/>
And I firmly believe in what Muhammad has said. </p>
<p>He also said: </p>
<p>I’m Abu Sulayman, an archer fine, </p>
<p>And come of a people of noble line. </p>
<p>His kunya was Abu Sulayman. </p>
<p>Thereupon he fought with the people until he and his two companions <br/>
were killed. </p>
<p><em>When 'Asim was slain Hudhayl wanted to take his head to sell it to <br/>
Sulafa d. Sa'd b. Shuhayd. When he killed her two sons at Uhud she <br/>
swore a vow that if she could get possession of his head she would drink <br/>
wine in his skull; but bees 2 protected him.</em> When the bees came between <br/>
it and them they said, ‘Let him alone until nightfall when they will leave <br/>
him and we can take the skull.’ But God sent a flood in the wadi and it <br/>
carried 'Asim away. Now 'Asim had made a covenant with God that no <br/>
polytheist should touch him nor would he ever touch a polytheist for fear <br/>
of contamination. <em>'Umar used to say when he heard of how the bees <br/>
protected him, ‘God protects the believer. 'Asim had vowed that no poly¬ <br/>
theist should touch him and that he would never touch one so long as he <br/>
lived, so God protected him after his death as he had protected himself <br/>
while he was alive.’</em> </p>
<p>Zayd, Khubayb, and Abdullah b. Tariq were weak and yielding in their <br/>
desire to preserve their lives so they surrendered and were bound and 64' <br/>
taken to Mecca to be sold there. When they were in al-Zahran 'Abdullah <br/>
bfoke loose from his bonds and drew his sword. But the men drew back <br/>
from him and stoned him until they killed him. His grave is in al-Zahran. <br/>
Khubayb and Zayd were brought to Mecca (66r). </p>
<p>Hujayr b. Abu Ihab al-Tamlml, an ally of B. Naufal, bought Khubayb <br/>
for 'Uqba b. al-Harith b. 'Amir b. Naufal, Abu Ihab being the brother of <br/>
al-Harith b. 'Amir by the same mother, to kill him in revenge for his <br/>
father (662). </p>
<p>Safwan b. Umayya bought Zayd to kill him in revenge for his father <br/>
Umayya b. Khalaf. Safwan sent him with a freedman of his called Nistas 3 <br/>
to al-Tan'Im and they brought him out of the haram to kill him. A number <br/>
of Quraysh gathered, among whom was Abu Sufyan b. Harb, who said to <br/>
him as he was brought out to be killed, ‘I adjure you by God, Zayd, don’t <br/>
you wish that Muhammad was with us now in your place so that we might </p>

<p>cut off his head, and that you were with your family ?’ Zayd answered, ‘By <br/>
God, I don’t wish that Muhammad now were in the place he occupies and <br/>
that a thorn could hurt him, and that I were sitting with my family.’ Abu <br/>
Sufyan used to say, ‘I have never seen a man who was so loved as Muham¬ <br/>
mad’s companions loved him.’ Then Nistas killed him, God pity him. </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. Abu Najlh told me that he was told by Mawiya, 1 freed- <br/>
woman of Hujayr b. Abu Ihab, who had become a Muslim: Khubayb was <br/>
imprisoned in my house and I looked at him one day with a bunch of <br/>
grapes in his hand as big as a man’s head from which he was eating. I did <br/>
not know that there were grapes on God’s earth that could be eaten (at <br/>
that time). </p>
<p>641 'Asim b. 'Umar b. Qatada and 'Abdullah b. Abu Najih both told me that <br/>
she said: When the time for his execution had come he asked me to send <br/>
him a razor with which to cleanse himself before he died; so I gave a razor <br/>
to a youth of the tribe and told him to take it to the man in the house. <br/>
Hardly had he turned his back to take it to him when I thought, ‘What <br/>
have I done ? By God, the man will take his revenge by killing the young¬ <br/>
ster and it will be man for man.’ But when he handed him the steel he <br/>
took it from him saying, ‘Good gracious, your mother was not afraid of my <br/>
treachery when she sent you to me with this razor!’ Then he let him go (663). </p>
<p>'Asim said, Then they took out Khubayb as far as al-Tan'Im to <br/>
crucify him. He asked them to give him time to make a couple of bowings, <br/>
and they agreed. He performed two excellent bowings and then turned to <br/>
the people saying, ‘Were it not that you would think that I only delayed <br/>
out of fear of death I would have prolonged my prayer.’ Khubayb b. <br/>
'Adly w r as the first to establish the custom of performing two bowings at <br/>
death. Then they raised him on the wood and when they had bound him <br/>
he said, ‘O God, we have delivered the message of Thy apostle, so tell him <br/>
tomorrow what has been done to us.’ Then he said, ‘O God, reckon them <br/>
by number and kill them one by one, let none of them escape.’ Then they <br/>
killed him, God pity him. </p>
<p>Mu'awiya b. Abu Sufyan used to say: ‘I was present that day among <br/>
those who were there with Abu Sufyan and I saw him throw me to the <br/>
ground out of fear of Khubayb’s curse.’ They used to say, ‘If a man is <br/>
cursed and is thrown to one side the curse will pass over him.’ </p>
<p>Yahya b. 'Abbad b. 'Abdullah b. al-Zubayr from his father 'Abbad <br/>
concerning 'Uqba b. al-Harith said: ‘I heard him say, “It was not I who <br/>
killed Khubayb, for I was too young to do that; but Abu Maysara brother <br/>
of B. 'Abdu’l-Dar took a lance and put it in my hand. Then he covered <br/>
my hand with his and thrust him with it until he killed him.’” </p>
<p>One of our companions said that 'Umar had appointed Sa'id b. 'Amir b. </p>
<p>642 Hidhyam al-Jumahi over a part of Syria. Fainting fits used to seize him <br/>
when he was among the people and ‘Umar was told of this. It was said </p>
<p>1 S. says that this is the reading of Yunus b. Bukayr and it is to be found in old copies of <br/>
I.H., but others give the name as Mariya on I.I.'s authority'. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 429 </p>
<p>that the man was subject to seizures. During one of his visits 'Umar asked <br/>
him the cause of the trouble and he said, ‘There is nothing the matter with <br/>
me, but I was one of those who was present when Khubayb b. 'Adly was <br/>
killed and I heard his curse, and whenever I remember it when I am in a <br/>
meeting I faint away.’ This increased his favour in 'Umar’s eyes (664). </p>
<p>A freedman of Zayd b. Thabit told me from 'Ikrima, freedman of Ibn <br/>
Abbas, or from Sa Id b. Jubayr, that Ibn Abbas said with reference to a <br/>
passage of the Quran about this expedition: When the expedition in which <br/>
Marthad and 'Asim took part came to grief in al-Raji' some of the dis¬ <br/>
affected said, ‘Alas for those beguiled fellows who perished thus! They <br/>
did not stay with their families nor did they deliver the message of their <br/>
master.’ Then God sent down concerning their words and the good they <br/>
gained by their suffering: ‘There is the kind of man whose talk about the <br/>
life of this world pleases you,’ i.e. when he professes Islam with his tongue, </p>
<p>‘and he calls God to witness about that which is in his heart’ which is <br/>
contrary to what he professes with his tongue, ‘yet he is the most quarrel¬ <br/>
some of adversaries’, i.e. a controversialist when he argues with you (66Q. 1 </p>
<p>God said, ‘And when he turns away,’ i.e. goes out from your presence, 643 <br/>
he hastens through the land to make mischief therein and to destroy the <br/>
crops and the cattle; but God loves notmischief,’ i.e. He does not love the <br/>
doing of it nor does it please Him. ‘And when it is said to him, Beware of <br/>
God, pride seizes him in sin. Hell will be his reckoning, an evil resting- <br/>
place. And there is the kind of man who would sell himself in his desire <br/>
to please God and God is kind to His servants,’ i.e. they sold themselves to <br/>
God by fighting in His way and doing what He required until they gave up <br/>
their lives. He means that expedition (666). </p>
<p>Among the poems about this is that of Khubayb b. 'Adly when he heard <br/>
that the people had gathered to crucify him (667): </p>
<p>The confederates gathered their tribes around me <br/>
And assembled all whom they could collect. </p>
<p>All of them show vidlent enmity against me <br/>
Because I am helpless in bonds. </p>
<p>They collect their women and children <br/>
And I am brought to a lofty high trunk. </p>
<p>To God I complain of my loneliness and pain </p>
<p>And of the death the confederates have prepared for me. </p>
<p>Lord of the throne, give me endurance against their purpose. </p>
<p>They have pierced my flesh—all hope is gone! </p>
<p>This is for God’s sake, and if He wills </p>
<p>1 Sura 2. 200. S. records a variant reading of Ibn Muhaysin, wayashhadu'lldhu for wayush- <br/>
hidu llaha, i.e. God knows what is in his heart, and this may well be the true reading. He <br/>
also says that the majority of commentators hold that this verse came down with reference <br/>
to al-Akhnas b. Shariq al-Thaqafi according to the tradition from Ibn 'Abbas through Abu <br/>
Malik, and Mujahid said the same. Ihnu’l-Kalbl said that when he was in Mecca he gave <br/>
that opinion, but one of al-Akhnas’s offspring denied it and said that it came down with <br/>
reference to the people of Mecca, </p>
<p>o The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>He will bless the limbs thus torn. </p>
<p>They let me choose infidelity but death is preferable, </p>
<p>And my tears flowed though not in fear. </p>
<p>I fear not death who am about to die <br/>
But I fear hell and its all-embracing fire. </p>
<p>By God, I fear not 1 if I die a Muslim <br/>
What death I suffer for God’s sake. </p>
<p>I will not show subservience to the enemy <br/>
Nor despair, for ’tis to God I return. </p>
<p>Hassan b. Thabit said, mourning Khubayb: </p>
<p>What ails thine eye that its tears cease not <br/>
Flowing on to thy breast like loose pearls ? </p>
<p>For Khubayb the hero, no coward when you meet him, </p>
<p>No fickle youth as men well know. </p>
<p>Then go, Khubayb, may God reward thee well </p>
<p>In the eternal gardens with houris among thy companions. </p>
<p>What will you say when the prophet says to you <br/>
When the pure angels are in the firmament, </p>
<p>Why did you kill God’s martyr for the sake of an evil man <br/>
Who committed crimes far and wide ? (668) </p>
<p>Hassan also said: </p>
<p>O eye, be generous with thy tears; </p>
<p>Weep for Khubayb who did not return with the warriors. </p>
<p>A hawk, ’midst the Ansar was his dignity, </p>
<p>Generous by nature of pure unmixed descent. </p>
<p>My eye was inflamed because of the difficulty of weeping 2 <br/>
When ’twas said, He has been lifted up on a tree. </p>
<p>O raider going forth on your business <br/>
Convey a threat—no idle threat <br/>
To the Banu Kuhayba that war’s milk <br/>
Will be bitter when its teats are pressed. </p>
<p>In it will be the lions of the Banu al-Najjar, </p>
<p>Their glittering spears in front of a great shouting army (669). </p>
<p>Hassan also said: </p>
<p>Had there been in the camp a noble chief, a warrior, </p>
<p>A champion of the people, a hawk whose uncle is Anas, </p>
<p>Then, Khubayb, you would have had a spacious place to sit in <br/>
And not have been confined by guards in prison. </p>
<p>Low adherents of the tribes would not have borne you to Tan'im, <br/>
Some of them men whom 'Udas had expelled. </p>
<p>1 raja is one of the atjddd. </p>
<p>1 i.e. my nature is such that my eyes are unaccustomed to tears. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 431 </p>
<p>They deceived you w'ith their treachery, breaking their faith, </p>
<p>You were wronged, a prisoner in their camp (670). </p>
<p>Those who formed the mob from Quraysh when Khubayb was killed <br/>
were Tkrima b. Abu Jahl; Sa'Id b. 'Abdullah b. Abu Qays b. 'Abdu Wudd; <br/>
al-Akhnas b. Shariq al-Thaqafl, ally of B. Zuhra; 'Ubayda b. Hakim b. <br/>
Umayya b, Haritha b. al-Auqas al-Sulaml, ally of B. Umayya b. 'Abdu <br/>
Shams; and Umayya b. Abu 'Utba and the B. al-Hadrami. </p>
<p>Hassan also said reviling Hudhayl for what they did to Khubayb: </p>
<p>Tell Banu 'Amr that a man steeped in treachery <br/>
Sold their brother as a chattel. </p>
<p>Zuhayr b. al-Agharr and Jami’ sold him, </p>
<p>Both of them committing foul crimes. </p>
<p>You promised him protection and having done so betrayed him. </p>
<p>In the region of al-Raji' you were as sharp swords. 1 </p>
<p>Would that Khubayb had not been deceived by your promise; </p>
<p>Would that he had known what people he was dealing with! (671) </p>
<p>Hassan also said: </p>
<p>If pure unalloyed treachery pleases you </p>
<p>Go to al-Raji' and ask about the abode of Lihyan; </p>
<p>A people who adjure one another to devour the guest among them. 2 <br/>
Dog and ape are like such men. </p>
<p>If a he-goat were to rise up and address them one day </p>
<p>He would be a man of honour and importance among them! (672) </p>
<p>Hassan also said: </p>
<p>Hudhayl asked the apostle for something disgraceful. </p>
<p>They erred therein and went astray; </p>
<p>They asked their apostle what he would not grant them <br/>
To their dying day and they were the disgrace of the Arabs. </p>
<p>Never will you see in Hudhayl one </p>
<p>Calling others to a generous deed in that place of plunder. </p>
<p>Woe to them who desired to make immoral conditions <br/>
To be allowed what the scripture forbids! </p>
<p>Hassan also said: </p>
<p>The tale of Khubayb and 'Asim </p>
<p>Has ruined the name of Hudhayl ibn Mudrik. </p>
<p>The tale of Lihyan has ruined their reputation, </p>
<p>For Lihyan has committed the worst of crimes. </p>
<p>Men, the best stock of their tribe, </p>
<p>Like hairs upon a horse’s fetlock, </p>
<p>1 Or, perhaps, ‘thieves’. </p>
<p>2 Bukhala , Cairo, 1948, p. 216, understands from this and other satirical poems <br/>
that these men were cannibals. </p>
<p>432 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad <br/>
Were treacherous on the day of al-Raji', </p>
<p>Betraying their ward to whom kindness and generosity were ue, </p>
<p>The apostle’s messenger. Hudhayl took no pains <br/>
To ward off the evil of loathsome crimes. </p>
<p>One day they will see victory turn against them <br/>
For killing one whom there protected against evil deeds <br/>
Swarms of hornets standing guard over his flesh <br/>
Which protected the flesh of one who witnessed great battles. </p>
<p>Perhaps in return for killing him Hudhayl will see <br/>
Dead lying prostrate or women mourning <br/>
As we bring a violent attack upon them, </p>
<p>Which riders will relate faithfully to those at the fairs <br/>
By command of God’s apostle, for he with full knowledge <br/>
Has made a forceful decision against Lihyan, </p>
<p>A contemptible tribe caring nothing for good faith. </p>
<p>If they are wronged they do not resist the aggressor. </p>
<p>When people live in an isolated quarter </p>
<p>You see them in the watercourses between the well-worn channels. </p>
<p>Un Their place is the home of death. . , , . </p>
<p>When anything happens to them they have the minds of cattle. </p>
<p>Hassan also said: </p>
<p>God curse Lihyan, for their blood does not repay us <br/>
For their having slain the two in treachery. </p>
<p>At al-Rajf they killed the son of a free woman <br/>
Faithful and pure in his friendship. </p>
<p>Had they all been killed on the day of al-Raji' </p>
<p>In revenge for 'Asim 2 that ’would not have sufficed <br/>
For the dead man whom the bees protected m their tents, </p>
<p>Among people of obvious infidelity and coarseness. </p>
<p>Lihyan killed one more honourable than they </p>
<p>And sold Khubayb for a miserable price, woe to them. </p>
<p>Ugh! for Lihyan in every event. </p>
<p>May their memory perish and not even be mentioned. </p>
<p>A contemptible tribe of mean and treacherous descent, </p>
<p>Their meanness cannot be concealed. </p>
<p>If they were slain their blood would not pay for him ^ </p>
<p>But the killing of his killers would cure me (of my pain). </p>
<p>Unless I die I will terrify Hudhayl with a plundering raid <br/>
Swift as the early morning cloud. </p>
<p>By the apostle’s command, and his it is. </p>
<p>Disaster will spend the night in Lihyan’s court. </p>

<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>The people in al-Raji' will be found in the morning </p>
<p>Like little goats who have passed the winter without warmth. 1 </p>
<p>Hassan also said: </p>
<p>By God, Hudhayl do not know </p>
<p>Whether Zamzam’s water is clean or foul; </p>
<p>And if they make the great or lesser pilgrimage </p>
<p>They have no share in the hijr or the running. </p>
<p>But at al-Raji' they have a place, </p>
<p>The home of open meanness and disgrace. </p>
<p>They are like goats in the Hijaz bleating </p>
<p>In the evening beside the shelters. </p>
<p>They were treacherous to Khubayb their ward. </p>
<p>What a miserable covenant was their false word! (673) </p>
<p>Hassan also said: 648 </p>
<p>God bless those who followed one another (to death) the day of al- <br/>
Raji' </p>
<p>And were honoured and rewarded. </p>
<p>Marthad the head and leader of the party and </p>
<p>Ibn al-Bukayr their imam and Khubayb. </p>
<p>And a son of Tariq; Ibn Dathinna was there too. </p>
<p>There his death as it was written befell him </p>
<p>And al-'Asim slain at Rajf </p>
<p>Attained the heights (of heaven) great gainer he. </p>
<p>He averted the disgrace of wounds in the back. </p>
<p>He met them sword in hand, the noble warrior (674). </p>
<p>THE STORY OF BI*R Ma'UNA IN SAFAR, A.H. 4 </p>
<p>The apostle stayed (in Medina) for the rest of Shawwal, Dhu’l-Qa'da, <br/>
Dhu’I-Hijja, and al-Muharram while the polytheists supervised the pil¬ <br/>
grimage. Then he sent the men of Bi’r Ma'una forth in Safar, four months <br/>
after Uhud. </p>
<p>My father Ishaq b. Yasar from al-Mughira b. Abdu’l-Rahman b. al- <br/>
Harith b. Hisham told me, as did 'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr b. Muhammad <br/>
b. 'Amr b. Hazm and other traditionists, as follows: Abu Bara’ 'Amir b. </p>
<p>Malik b. Ja'far the ‘Player with the Spears’ came to the apostle in Medina <br/>
(T and offered him a present. The apostle refused it, saying that he could T- 1442 <br/>
not accept a present from a polytheist and telling him to become a Muslim <br/>
if he wished him to accept his present ). 2 The apostle explained Islam to <br/>
him and invited him to accept it. He would not do so yet he was not far <br/>
from Islam. He said: 'O Muhammad (T. your affair to which you invite </p>
<p>1 I follow the reading of C. </p>
<p>2 F’s version is more verbose than I.H.’s recension. </p>
<p>F f </p>
<p>B 4080 </p>
<p>434 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>me is most excellent). If you were to send some of your companions to <br/>
the people of Najd and they invited them to your affair I have good hopes <br/>
that they would give you a favourable answer.’ The apostle said that he <br/>
feared that the people of Najd would kill them; to which Abu Bara’ replied <br/>
that he would go surety for them, so let him send them and invite men to <br/>
his religion. So the apostle sent al-Mundhir b. 'Amr, brother of B. Sa'ida, <br/>
‘The Quick to seek Death’, with forty of his companions from the best of </p>
<p>649 the Muslims. Among them were al-Harith b. al-Simma; Haram b. Milhan, <br/>
brother of B. 'Adly b. al-Najjar; 'Urwa b. Asma’ b. al-Salt al-Sulaml; <br/>
Nafi' b. Budayl b. Warqa’ al-Khuza'i; 'Amir b. Fuhayra, freedman of Abu <br/>
Bakr, of those who were named of the best Muslims. (T. Humayd al- <br/>
Tawll from Anas b. Malik who said that the apostle sent al-Mundhir b. <br/>
'Amr with seventy riders.) 1 They went on until they halted at Bi’r Ma'una <br/>
which is between the land of B. 'Amir and the harra of B. Sulaym, near to <br/>
both districts but nearer to the harra . </p>
<p>When they alighted at it they sent Haram b. Milhan with the apostle’s <br/>
letter to the enemy of God 'Amir b. Tufayl. When he came to him he <br/>
rushed at the man and killed him before he even looked at the letter. Then <br/>
he tried to call out the B. 'Amir against them, but they refused to do what <br/>
he wanted, saying that they would not violate the promise of security which <br/>
Abu Bara’ had given these men. Then he appealed to the tribes of B. <br/>
Sulaym of 'Usayya, Ri'I, and Dhakwan, and they agreed and came out <br/>
against them and surrounded them as they were with their camels. Seeing <br/>
them they drew their swords and fought to the last man. All were killed <br/>
but Ka'b b. Zayd, brother of B. Dinar b. al-Najjar; him they left while <br/>
breath was in him. He was picked up from among the slain and lived until <br/>
the battle of the Trench when he was killed as a martyr. </p>
<p>'Amr b. Umayya al-Damrl and an Ansar! of B. 'Amr b. 'Auf were with <br/>
the camels out at pasture (675). They did not know of the death of their <br/>
companions until they saw vultures circling round the camp. They knew <br/>
that this must mean that something serious had happened, so they went <br/>
to investigate and there were the men lying in their blood and the horse¬ <br/>
men who had killed them standing near. 'Amr’s opinion was that they <br/>
should rejoin the apostle and tell him the news, but the Ansar! said that he <br/>
could not bring himself to leave the spot where al-Mundhir had been slain, <br/>
nor could he bear that people should say that he had done such a thing, so <br/>
he fought the party until he was killed. They took 'Amr prisoner, and <br/>
when he told them that he was of Mudar, 'Amir b. al-Tufayl let him go </p>
<p>650 after cutting off his forelock. He freed him, so he alleged, because of an <br/>
oath taken by his mother. 2 </p>
<p>'Amr got as far as al-Qarqara at the beginning of Qanat when two men <br/>
of B. 'Amir turned up and stopped with him in the shade (676). Now <br/>
there was an agreement of friendship between the apostle and the two </p>
<p>1 This is accepted by Bukhari. </p>
<p>2 Cf. the shorter account in Musa b. 'Uqba, No. 7. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad ^- </p>
<p>Amiris of which 'Amr knew nothing, and when after questioning he found <br/>
th , at th ? y be °nged to B. 'Amir he let them alone for a time until they slept <br/>
when he fell upon them and killed them, thinking that he had taken <br/>
vengeance on them for the killing of the apostle’s companions. But when <br/>
he came to the apostle and told him what he had done he said ‘You have <br/>
killed two men whose bloodwit I must pay.’ Then the apostle said '‘This <br/>
is (the result of) Abu Bara’s act. I did not like this expedition fearing <br/>
what would happen.’ When Abu Bara’ heard the news he was much <br/>
upset at Amir’s violation of his guarantee in that the apostle’s companions <br/>
had been killed because of what he had done and because he had promised <br/>
them safety. Among those who were killed was 'Amir b. Fuhayra. </p>
<p>Hisham b. 'Urwa from his father told me that 'Amir b. al-Tufayl used to <br/>
ask, W ho was the man I saw lifted up between heaven and earth when he <br/>
ad been killed until I saw the sky receive him?’ They answered, ‘It was <br/>
Amir b. Fuhayra. </p>
<p>One of B. Jabbar b. Salma b. Malik b. Ja'far told me-Jabbar was among <br/>
those who were present that day with 'Amir and afterwards became a Mus- <br/>
im that Jabbar used to say, 'What led me to become a Muslim was that <br/>
stabbed one of them between the shoulders that day and I saw the point <br/>
ot the spear come out of his chest, and I heard him say, "I have won by <br/>
, 1 couId n °t make out what he meant by the words seeing that I had <br/>
killed him until afterwards I asked others and was told that it was martyr- <br/>
dom, and then I said, 4£ By God he has won.” 1 </p>
<p>Hassan b. Thabit, inciting B. Abu Bara’ against 'Amir b, al-Tufayl, said: </p>
<p>^ e sons of Ummu’l-Banln, are you not dismayed, </p>
<p>You the loftiest of Najd’s people, </p>
<p>At Amir s insolence to Abu Bara’ in violating his safe conduct? 6si <br/>
For a mistake is not the same as a deliberate act. </p>
<p>Say to Rabi a who strives after great deeds, </p>
<p>What did you do after I left you ? </p>
<p> our father Abu Bara’ is a man of war, </p>
<p>Your uncle Hakam b. Sa'd is celebrated (677). </p>
<p>ET*<em> Ka b b. Malik also said on the same subject</em> </p>
<p>T- 144 </p>
<p>The violation of Abu Bara”s guarantee u ^* </p>
<p>Is blazed abroad far and wide. </p>

<p>THE DEPORTATION OF THE B. AL-NADIR, A.H. 4 </p>
<p>According to what Yazid b. Ruman told me the apostle went to B. al- 652 <br/>
Nadir to ask for their help in paying the bloodwit for the two men of B. </p>
<p>‘Amir whom 'Amr b. Umayya al-Damri had killed after he had given them <br/>
a promise of security. There was a mutual alliance between B. al-Nadir <br/>
and B. 'Amir. When the apostle came to them about the bloodwit they <br/>
said that of course they would contribute in the way he wished; but they <br/>
took counsel with one another apart, saying, ‘You will never get such a <br/>
chance again. Who will go to the top of the house and drop a rock on him <br/>
(T. so as to kill him) and rid us of him ?’ The apostle was sitting by the T. 1448 <br/>
wall of one of their houses at the time. 'Amr b. Jihash b. Ka'b volunteered <br/>
to do this and went up to throw down a rock. 1 As the apostle was with a <br/>
number of his companions among whom were Abu Bakr, 'Umar, and 'All, <br/>
news came to him from heaven about what these people intended, so he <br/>
got up (T. and said to his companions, ‘Don’t go away until I come to <br/>
you’) and he w r ent back to Medina. When his companions had waited long 653 <br/>
for the prophet, they got up to search for him and met a man coming from <br/>
Medina and asked him about him. He said that he had seen him entering <br/>
Medina, and they went off, and when they found him he told them of the <br/>
treachery w’hich the Jews meditated against him. The apostle ordered them <br/>
to prepare for war and to march against them (679). Then he went off with <br/>
the men until he came upon them (680). </p>
<p>The Jews took refuge in their forts and the apostle ordered that the <br/>
palm-trees should be cut down and burnt, and they called out to him, <br/>
‘Muhammad, you have prohibited wanton destruction and blamed those <br/>
guilty of it. Why then are you cutting down and burning our palm-trees ?’ </p>
<p>Now there was a number of B. 'Auf b. al-Khazraj among whom were <br/>
‘Abdullah b. Ubayy b. Salul and Wadi'a and Malik b. Abu Qauqal and <br/>
Suwayd and Da'is who had sent to B. al-Nadir saying, ‘Stand firm and <br/>
protect yourselves, for we will not betray you. If you are attacked wc will <br/>
fight with you and if you are turned out, we will go with you.’ Accordingly <br/>
they waited for the help they had promised, but they did nothing and God <br/>
cast terror into their hearts. They asked the apostle to deport them and to <br/>
spare their lives on condition that they could retain all their property which <br/>
they could carry on camels, except their armour, and he agreed. So they <br/>
loaded their camels with what they could carry, .Men were destroying <br/>
their houses down to the lintel of the door which they put upon the back <br/>
of their camels and went off with it. Some went to Khaybar and others <br/>
went to Syria. Among their chiefs who went to Khaybar were Sallam b. </p>
<p>! I think it is clear that another and later story has been attached to this incident. Ob¬ <br/>
viously if the prophet had overheard their designs there was no need of a supernatural <br/>
communication from heaven. Further, it should be noted that in this later story the apostle <br/>
i» called ‘the prophet'. Thi9 is a term which 1.1. uses most sparingly, though it is fairly <br/>
frequently employed by his editor I.H. </p>
<p>438 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Abu’l-Huqayq, Kinana b. al-Rabl b. Abu’l-Huqayq, and Huyayy b. AJkh- <br/>
tab. When they got there the inhabitants became subject to them. </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr told me that he was told that they carried off the <br/>
women and children and property with tambourines and pipes and singing- <br/>
girls playing behind them. Among them was Umm 'Amr, wife of 'Urwa b. <br/>
al-Ward al-'Absi, whom they had bought from him, she being one of the </p>
<p>654 women of B. Ghifar. (They went) with such pomp and splendour as had <br/>
never been seen in any tribe in their days. </p>
<p>They left their property to the apostle and it became his personal <br/>
property which he could dispose of as he wished. He divided it among the <br/>
first emigrants to the exclusion of the Ansar, except that Sahl b. Hunayf <br/>
and Abu Dujana Simak b. Kharasha complained of poverty and so he gave <br/>
them some. Only two of B. al-Nadlr became Muslims: Yamin b. ‘Umayr <br/>
Abu Ka'b b. 'Amr 1 b. Jihash and Abu Sa'd b. Wahb who became Muslims <br/>
in order to retain their property. </p>
<p>One of Yamln’s family told me that the apostle said to Yamin, ‘Have you <br/>
seen the way your cousin has treated me and what he proposed to do?’ <br/>
Thereupon Yamin gave a man money to kill 'Amr b. Jihash and he did <br/>
kill him, or so they allege. </p>
<p>Concerning B. al-Nadlr the Sura of Exile came down in which is <br/>
recorded how God wreaked His vengeance on them and gave His apostle <br/>
power over them and how He dealt with them. God said: ‘He it is who <br/>
turned out those who disbelieved of the scripture people from their homes <br/>
to the first exile. You did not think that they would go out and they thought <br/>
that their forts would protect them from God. But God came upon them <br/>
from a direction they had not reckoned and He cast terror into their hearts <br/>
so that they destroyed their houses with their own hands and the hands of <br/>
the believers.’ 2 That refers to their destroying their houses to extract the <br/>
lintels of the doors when they carried them away. ‘So consider this, you <br/>
who have understanding. Had not God prescribed deportation against <br/>
them,’ which was vengeance from God, ‘He would have punished them in <br/>
this world,’ i.e. with the sword, ‘and in the next world there would be the <br/>
punishment of hell’ as well. ‘The palm-trees which you cut down or left <br/>
standing upon their roots.’ Lina means other than the best kind of dates. <br/>
‘It was by God’s permission,’ i.e. they were cut down by God’s order; it <br/>
was not destruction but was vengeance from God, ‘and to humble evil- </p>
<p>655 doers’ (68i). ‘The spoil which God gave the apostle from them,’ i.e. from <br/>
B. al-Nadlr. ‘You did not urge on your cavalry or riding camels for the <br/>
sake of it, but God gives His apostle power over whom He wills and God is <br/>
Almighty,’ i.e. it was peculiar to him (682), ‘The spoil which God gave the <br/>
apostle from the people of the towns belongs to God and His apostle.’ <br/>
What the Muslims gallop against with horses and camels and what is cap¬ <br/>
tured by force of arms belongs to’God and the apostle. ‘And is for the next <br/>
of kin and orphans and the poor and the wayfarer so that it should not </p>

<p>The Life of Muhammad ^9 </p>
<p>circulate among your rich men; and what the apostle gives you take and <br/>
abstain from what he forbids you.’ He says this is another division between <br/>
Muslims concerning what is taken in war according to what God prescribed <br/>
to him. 1 r </p>

Abdullah b. Ubayy and his companions and those who are like-minded <br/>
who say to their brothers of the scripture people who disbelieve,’ i.e. the <br/>
B. al-Nadlr, up to the words ‘like those who a short time before them tasted <br/>
the misery of their acts and had a painful punishment,’ i.e. the B. Qaynuqa'. <br/>
Then as far as the words ‘Like Satan when he said to man Disbelieve and <br/>
when man disbelieved he said, I am quit of you. I fear Allah the Lord of <br/>
the worlds and the punishment of both is that they will be in hell ever¬ <br/>
lastingly. That is the reward of the evildoers.’ </p>
<p>Among the verses composed about B. al-Nadlr are the following from <br/>
I. Luqaym al-'Absi. (Others say Qays b. Bahr b. Tarlf was the author </p>

<p>The Life of Muhammad 441 </p>
<p>When they learned that he w 7 as dead. </p>
<p>They said to Ahmad, ‘Leave us awhile, </p>
<p>For we are not yet recovered from weeping.’ </p>
<p>So he left them; then he said, ‘Begone <br/>
In submission and humiliation.’ </p>
<p>He sent al-Nadir to a distant exile, </p>
<p>They having enjoyed a prosperous home </p>
<p>To Adhri'at 1 riding pillion </p>
<p>On every ulcerous worn-out camel they had. </p>
<p>Sammak the Jew answered him: </p>
<p>If you boast, for it is a boast for you <br/>
That you killed Ka'b b. al-Ashraf <br/>
The day that you compassed his death, </p>
<p>A man who had shown neither treachery nor bad faith, </p>
<p>Haply time and the change of fortune 658 </p>
<p>Will take revenge from ‘the just and righteous one’ 2 </p>
<p>For killing al-Nadir and their confederates </p>
<p>And for cutting down the palms, their dates ungathered. </p>
<p>Unless I die w r e will come at you w r ith lances </p>
<p>And every sharp sword that w 7 e have </p>
<p>In the hand of a brave man who protects himself. </p>

<p>When he attacks he is no weakling <br/>
Like a lion in Tarj 4 protecting his covert, </p>
<p>Lord of the thicket, crushing his prey, enormous. </p>
<p>Ka'b b. Malik said on the same subject: </p>
<p>The rabbis were disgraced through their treachery, </p>
<p>Thus time’s wheel turns round. </p>
<p>They had denied the mighty Lord <br/>
Whose command is great. </p>
<p>They had been given knowledge and understanding <br/>
And a warner from God came to them, </p>
<p>A truthful warner who brought a book <br/>
With plain and luminous verses. </p>
<p>They said, ‘You’ve brought no true thing </p>
<p>And you are more worthy of God’s disapproval 5 than we.* </p>
<p>He said, ‘Nay, but I’ve brought the truth, </p>
<p>The wise and intelligent believe me; </p>
<p>He who follows it will be rightly guided </p>

<p>And when they imbibed treachery and unbelief <br/>
And aversion turned them from the truth, </p>
<p>God showed the prophet a sound view. </p>
<p>For God’s decision is not false. </p>
<p>He strengthened him and gave him power over them <br/>
And was his Helper, an excellent Helper! </p>
<p>Ka'b was left prostrate there. </p>
<p>After his fall Nadir was brought low. </p>
<p>Sword in hand w r e cut him down <br/>
By Muhammad’s order w'hen he sent secretly by night <br/>
Ka'b’s brother, to go to Ka'b. </p>
<p>&amp;S 9 He beguiled him and brought him down with guile. </p>
<p>Mahmud was trustworthy, bold. </p>
<p>Those Banu’l-Nadlr were in evil case, </p>
<p>They w r ere destroyed for their crimes </p>
<p>The day the apostle came to them with an army </p>
<p>Walking softly as he looked at them. </p>
<p>Ghassan the protectors were his helpers <br/>
Against the enemies as he helped them. </p>
<p>He said ‘(I offer) Peace, woe to you,’ but they refused <br/>
And lies and deceit were their allies. </p>
<p>They tasted the results of their deeds in misery, </p>
<p>Every three of them shared one camel. </p>
<p>They were driven out and made for Qaynuqa', </p>
<p>Their palms and houses were abandoned. </p>
<p>Sammak the Jew answered him: </p>
<p>I was sleepless while deep care was my guest <br/>
On a night that made all others seem short. </p>
<p>I saw that all the rabbis rejected him, </p>
<p>All of them men of knowledge and experience <br/>
WTo used to study every science <br/>
Of which the Law and Psalms do speak. </p>
<p>You killed Ka'b the chief of the rabbis, 1 <br/>
He whose ward was always safe. </p>
<p>He came dow r n to Mahmud his brother, 2 <br/>
But Mahmud was harbouring a wicked design. </p>
<p>He left him in his blood looking as though <br/>
Saffron was flowing o’er his clothes. </p>
<p>By your father and mine, </p>
<p>1 Ka'b was nothing of the kind. His father was of though his mother belonged </p>
<p>to B, al-Natfir. Can the forger possibly have confused him with Ka'b al-Ahbar? </p>
<p>2 But the man’s name was Silkan (W. 551, line 2). Is the forger referring to Muhammad <br/>
b. Maslama, one of the assassins, whom he confused with Mahmud b. Maslama (W. 758, <br/>
769)? </p>

<p>You would have seen laughter and gaiety within it. </p>
<p>By my life, shall I show you women in howdahs <br/>

<p>Large-eyed like the gazelles of Tabala; </p>
<p>Maidens that would bewitch one calmed by much truck with women ? l <br/>

<p>You weep bitterly over the Jewish dead and yet you can see <br/>
Those nearer and dearer to you if you want to weep. </p>
<p>Why do you not weep o’er the dead in Urayniq’s valley <br/>
And not lament loudly with sad face (over others) ? </p>
<p>When peace reigned with a friend you rejected it. </p>
<p>In religion an obstruction, in war a poltroon. </p>
<p>You aimed at power for your people, seeking <br/>
Someone similar that you might get glory and victory. </p>
<p>When you wanted to give praise you went <br/>
To one whom to praise is falsehood and shame. </p>
<p>You got what you deserved and you did not find <br/>
One among them to say Welcome to you. </p>
<p>Why did you not praise people whose kings <br/>
Built up their standing from ancient fame, </p>
<p>A tribe who became kings and w'ere honoured ? </p>
<p>None seeking food was ever found hungry among them. </p>
<p>Such are more worthy of praise than Jews; </p>
<p>In them you see proud glory firmly established. </p>

<p>You satirized the purest stock of the two priests, 1 <br/>
Yet you always enjoyed favours at their hands. </p>
<p>’Twere more fitting that you should weep for them, </p>
<p>Your people too if they paid their debt of gratitude. </p>
<p>Gratitude is the best fruit of kindness, </p>
<p>And the most fitting act of one who would do right. </p>
<p>You are as one who cuts off his head <br/>

<p>Had you met them in their homes <br/>

<p>They were the first to perform noble deeds in war, </p>
<p>Welcoming the needy guest with kind words. 4 </p>

<p>After it had sent Lu’ayy flying east and west 5 </p>

<p>Which once was great became feeble. </p>
<p>Salam and I. Sa'ya died a violent death <br/>
And I. Akhtab was led to a humiliating fate. </p>
<p>He made such noise in seeking glory (’twas really humiliation he <br/>
sought), </p>
<p>What he gained from his fuss was frustration, 6 </p>
<p>Like him who leaves the plain and the height distresses him, </p>

<p>1 Commentators say that there were two tribes known as the Kahinayn in the neighbour¬ <br/>
hood of Medina. Some read kahinirt in the plural. If (cf. v. 5) one of these tribes was the <br/>
'Sons of Aaron', could the other have been the tribe of Moses ? But one must not take this <br/>
forger’s work too seriously. What Jew would refer to the Bible as ‘The Law and the <br/>
Psalms' ? However, it is possible that al-zubur here means no more than ‘The Writings’. <br/>

<p>THE RAID OF DHATU’l-RIQa' </p>
<p>After the attack on B. al-Nadtr the apostle stayed in Medina during <br/>
Rabi'u’I-Akhir and part of Jumada. Then he raided Najd making for B. <br/>
Muharib and B. Tha'Iaba of Ghatafan (687), until he stopped at Nakhl. 662 <br/>
This was the raid of Dhatu’l-Riqa'. There a large force of Ghatafan was <br/>
encountered. The two forces approached one another, but no fighting <br/>
occurred, for each feared the other. The apostle led the prayer of fear; <br/>
then he went off with the men. </p>
<p>(T. Muhammad b. Ja'far b. al-Zubayr and Muhammad b. 'Abdu’l- T- 1454 <br/>
Rahman from 'Urwa b. al-Zubayr from Abu Hurayra: We went with the <br/>
apostle to Najd until at Dhatu’l-Riqa' he met a number of Ghatafan. </p>
<p>There was no fighting because the men were afraid of them. The prayer <br/>
of fear came down 2 and he divided his companions into two sections, one <br/>
facing the enemy and the other behind the apostle. The apostle cried <br/>
‘Allah akbar,’ and so did they all. Thendie bowed with those behind him, <br/>
and he and they prostrated themselves. When they stood erect they walked <br/>
backwards to the ranks of their companions and the others returned and <br/>
prayed one bow. Then they stood erect and the apostle prayed one bow <br/>
with them and they sat. Those who were facing the enemy came back and <br/>
prayed the second bow and all sat and the apostle united them with the <br/>
salam, and gave them the Muslim greeting.) 3 (688) </p>
<p>'Amr b. 'Ubayd from al-Hasan from Jabir b. 'Abdullah told me that a 663 <br/>
man of B. Muharib called Gbaurath said to his people of Ghatafan and <br/>
Muharib, ‘Shall I kill Muhammad for you?’ They encouraged him to do <br/>
so and asked him how he proposed to carry out his design. He said that <br/>
he would take him by surprise; so be went to the apostle as he was sitting <br/>
with his sword in his lap, and asked to be allowed to look at it (689). The <br/>
apostle gave it to him and he drew it and began to brandish it intending <br/>
to strike him, but God frustrated 4 him. He said, ‘Aren’t you afraid of me, <br/>
Muhammad?’ ‘No, w r hy should I be?’ ‘Aren’t you afraid of me when I <br/>
have a sword in my hand ?’ ‘No, God will protect me from you.’ Then he <br/>
returned the apostle’s sword to him. God sent down, ‘O you who believe, <br/>
remember God’s favour to you when a people purposed to lay hands on <br/>
you and he turned their hands away from you. Fear God and on God let <br/>
the believers rely.’ 5 </p>
<p>Yazld b. Ruman told me that this came down in reference to 'Amr b. </p>

<p>Jihash, brother of B. al-Nadlr, and his intention. But God knows the truth <br/>
of the matter. </p>
<p>Wahb b. Kaysan from Jabir b. 'Abdullah said: I went out with the <br/>
apostle to the raid of Dhatu’l-Riqa'of Nakhl on an old feeble camel of mine. <br/>
On the way back the company kept going on while I dropped farther <br/>
behind until the apostle overtook me and asked me what the trouble was. </p>
<p>I told him that my camel was keeping me back, and he told me to make it <br/>
kneel. I did so and the apostle made his camel kneel and then said, ‘Give <br/>
me this stick you are holding’ or ‘Cut me a stick from a tree.’ He took it <br/>
and prodded the beast with it a few times. Then he told me to mount and <br/>
off we went. By Him who sent him with the truth my (old) camel kept up <br/>
with the rapid pace of his she-camel. </p>
<p>As we were talking, the apostle asked me if I would sell him my camel. <br/>
I said that I would give him it, but he insisted on buying it, so I asked him <br/>
to make me an offer. He said he would give me a dirham. I refused and <br/>
664 said that would be cheating me. Then he offered two dirhams and I still <br/>
refused and the apostle went on raising his offer until it amounted to an <br/>
ounce (of gold). When I asked him if he was really satisfied he said that he <br/>
was and I said the camel was his. Then he asked me if I were married; <br/>
then was she a virgin or a woman previously married ? I told him she had <br/>
been married before and he said, ‘No girl so that you could sport together!’ <br/>
I told him that my father had been killed at Uhud leaving seven daughters <br/>
and I had married a motherly woman who could look after them efficiently. <br/>
He said, ‘You have done well, if God will. Had we come to Sirar 1 we <br/>
would order camels to be slaughtered and stay there for the day and she <br/>
would hear about us and shake the dust off her cushions.’ I said, ‘But by <br/>
God we have no cushions!’ He said, ‘But you will have. When you return <br/>
behave wisely.’ When we got to Sirar the apostle ordered the camels to be <br/>
slaughtered and we stayed there for the day. At night the apostle went <br/>
home and so did we. I told the woman the news and what the apostle had <br/>
said to me. She said‘Look alive and do what he tells you.’ In the morning <br/>
I led away the camel and made it kneel at the apostle’s door. Then I sat <br/>
inside the mosque hard by. He came out and saw it and asked what it was, <br/>
and they told him it was the camel which I had brought. He asked where I <br/>
was and I was summoned to him. He said, ‘O son of my brother, take away <br/>
your camel for it is yours,’ and he called Bilal and told him to give me an <br/>
ounce of gold. He did so and added a little more. By God it continued <br/>
to thrive with me and its effect on our household could be seen until it <br/>
was lost recently in the misfortune which befell us, meaning the day of <br/>
al-Harra. 2 </p>

<p>The Life of Muhammad 447 </p>
<p>al-Ansarl said: We went with the apostle on the raid of Dhatu’I-Riqa' of <br/>
Nakhl and a man killed the wife of one of the polytheists. When the 665 <br/>
apostle was on his way back her husband, who had been away, returned <br/>
and heard the news of her death. He swore that he would not rest until <br/>
he had taken vengeance on Muhammad’s companions. He went off follow¬ <br/>
ing the track of the apostle, who when he halted asked that someone should <br/>
keep watch during the night. A Muhajir and an Ansari volunteered and he <br/>
told them to stay in the mouth of the pass, the apostle and his companions <br/>
having halted lower down the pass (690). </p>
<p>When the two had gone to take up their positions the Ansari asked the <br/>
Muhajir! whether he would prefer to watch for the first or the second part <br/>
of the night. He said that he would like to be relieved of the first part and <br/>
lay down and went to sleep, while the Ansari stood up to pray. The man <br/>
who had been following them perceiving the figure of the man on guard <br/>
and recognizing him for what he was, shot him with an arrow. The guard <br/>
pulled it out and laid it down and remained standing. He shot him a <br/>
second and a third time, and each time he pulled out the arrow' and laid it <br/>
down. Then he bowed and prostrated himself. Only then did he wake his <br/>
companion, saying, ‘Sit down, for I have been wounded.’ But he leapt up, <br/>
and tvhen the man saw the two of them he knew that they were aware of <br/>
him and fled. When the Muhajir! saw the Ansari flowing with blood he <br/>
said ‘Good gracious, why didn’t you w r ake me the first time you w r ere hit?’ </p>
<p>He replied, ‘I was reading a sura and I did not want to stop until I had <br/>
finished it. When the shooting continued I bowed in prayer and woke you. </p>
<p>By God, unless I were to lose a post which the apostle had ordered me to <br/>
hold he could have killed me before I would break off my reading until I <br/>
had finished the sura (691).’ </p>
<p>When the apostle came to Medina after this raid he stayed there for the <br/>
rest of Jumada’l-ula, Jumada’l-akhira, and Rajab. </p>
<p>THE LAST EXPEDITION TO BADR, A.H. 4 666 </p>
<p>In Sha'ban he went forth to Badr to keep his appointment with Abu Sufyan <br/>
and stopped there (692). </p>
<p>He stayed there for eight nights waiting for Abu Sufyan. Abu Sufyan <br/>
with the men of Mecca went as far as Majanna in the area of (T. Murr) <br/>
al-Zahran. Some people say he reached (T. passed through) 'Usfan; then <br/>
he decided to go back. He told the Quraysh that the only suitable year w r as <br/>
a fertile year when they could pasture the animals on the herbage and drink <br/>
their milk, whereas this was a dry year. He was going to return and they <br/>
must return with him. And so they did. The Meccans called them ‘the <br/>
porridge army’, saying that they merely w r ent out to drink porridge. 1 </p>
<p>While the apostle was staying at Badr waiting for Abu Sufyan to keep </p>
<p>1 Sawiq was made of parched wheat or barley, mixed with water or butter; it was ‘drunk’ <br/>
as a sort of porridge. </p>
<p>44 § The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>his appointment Makhshiy b. 'Amr al-Damn, who had made an agreement <br/>
with him concerning B. £&gt;amra in the raid of Waddan, came to him and <br/>
asked him if he had come to meet Quraysh by this water. He said, ‘Yes, O <br/>
brother of B. Damra; nevertheless, if you wish we will cancel the arrange¬ <br/>
ment between us and then fight you until God decide between usd He <br/>
answered, ‘No, by God, Muhammad, we do not want anything of the <br/>
kind.’ </p>
<p>As he remained waiting for Abu Sufyan, Ma'bad b. Abu Ma'bad al- <br/>
Khuza'I passed by. He had seen where the apostle was as his she-camel <br/>
passed swiftly by and he said: </p>
<p>She fled from the two companies of Muhammad <br/>
And a datestone from Yathrib like a raisin stone <br/>
Hastening in the ancient religion of her fathers. </p>
<p>She made the water of Qudayd 1 my meeting-place <br/>
And the water of Pajnan 2 will be hers tomorrow'. </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. Raw'aha said concerning this: (693): </p>
<p>We arranged to meet Abu Sufyan at Badr, </p>
<p>But we did not find him true to his promise, </p>
<p>667 I swear if you had kept your w'ord and met us </p>
<p>You would have returned disgraced without your nearest kin. </p>
<p>We had left there the limbs of 'Utba and his son <br/>
And 'Amr Abu Jahl we left lying there. </p>
<p>You disobeyed God’s apostle—disgusting your religion <br/>
And your evil state that’s all astray. </p>
<p>If you reproach me I say </p>
<p>My wealth and people be the apostle’s ransom! </p>
<p>We obey him treating none among us as his equal. </p>
<p>He is our guiding light in the darkness of the night. </p>
<p>Hassan b. Thabit said concerning that: </p>
<p>You can say good-bye to Syria’s running streams, </p>
<p>For in between are swords like mouths of pregnant camels that feed <br/>
on arak trees </p>

<p>THE BATTLE OF THE DITCH, 1 A.H. $ </p>
<p>669 This took place in ShawwSl, A.H. 5. Yazid b. Rum 3 n, client of the family <br/>
of al-Zubayr b. 'Urwa b. al-Zubayr, and one whom I have no reason to <br/>
suspect from ‘Abdullah b. Ka'b b. Malik, and Muhammad b. Ka'b al- <br/>
Qura^i, and al-Zuhxi, and *A$im b. ‘Umar b. Qatada, and Abdullah b. <br/>
Abu Bakr and other traditionists of ours told me the following narrative, <br/>
each contributing a part of it: </p>
<p>A n um ber of Jews who had formed a party against the apostle, among <br/>
whom- were SalLam b. Abu’l-IJuqayq al-Nadn, and Huyayy b. Akh|ab al- <br/>
Nadri and KinSna b. Abu’I-Huqayq al-Nadri, and Haudha b. Qays al- <br/>
Wi’ili, and Abu ‘Ammar al-Wa’ili with a number of B. al-Nadlr and B. <br/>
WS’il went to Quraysh at Mecca and invited them to join them in an attack <br/>
on the apostle so that they might get rid of him altogether. Quraysh said, <br/>
‘You, O Jews, are the first scripture people and know the nature of our <br/>
dispute with Muhammad. Is our religion the best or is his ?’ They replied <br/>
that cer tainl y their religion was better than his and they had a better claim <br/>
to be in the right. (It was about them that God sent down, ‘Have you not <br/>
considered those to whom a part of the scripture was given who believe in <br/>
idols and false deities and say to those who disbelieve, These are more <br/>
rightly guided than those who believe ? These are they whom God hath <br/>
cursed and he whom God has cursed you will find for him no helper as <br/>
far as His words, ‘Or are they jealous of men because of what God from <br/>
His bounty has brought to them?* i.e. prophecy. ‘We gave the family of <br/>
Abraham the scripture and wisdom and we gave them a great kingdom and <br/>
some of them believed in it and some of them turned from it, and hell is <br/>
sufficient for (their) burning.’) 2 </p>
<p>These words rejoiced Quraysh and they responded gladly to their invita¬ <br/>
tion to fight the apostle, and they assembled and made their preparations. <br/>
Then that company of Jews went off to GhatafSn of Qays Ayl5n and <br/>
invited them to fight the apostle and told them that they would act with <br/>
them and that Quraysh had followed their lead in the matter; so they too <br/>
joined in with them ( r £ and agreed to what they suggested). </p>
<p>670 Quraysh marched under the leadership of Abu Sufyan b. Harb; and <br/>
Gha|afan led by Uyayna b. Hi§n b. Hudhayfa b. Badr with B. FazSra; and <br/>
al-Ijarith b. <em>Auf b. Abu Haritha al-Murri with B. Murra; and Mis'ar b. <br/>
Rukhayla b. Nuwayra b. Tarif b. Suhma b. ‘Abdullah b. Hilal b. Khalawa <br/>
b. Ashja</em> b. Rayth b. Ghatafan with those of his people from Ashja who <br/>
followed him. </p>
<p>When the apostle heard of their intention he drew a trench about Medina <br/>
and worked at it himself encouraging the Muslims with the hope of reward <br/>
in heaven. The Muslims worked very hard with him, but the disaffected <br/>
held back from them and began to hide their real object by working slackly <br/>
and by stealing away to their families without the apostle’s permission or </p>
<p>'* 1 The story comet from I.I. by way of iI-Bikkil end I.H. * SGra 4. 54 f. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 451 </p>
<p>knowledge. A Muslim who had to attend to an urgent matter would ask <br/>
the apostle's permission to go and would get it, and when he had carried <br/>
out his business he would return to the work he had left because of his <br/>
desire to do what was right and his respect for the same. So God sent <br/>
down concerning those believers: ‘They only are the believers who believe <br/>
in God and His apostle and when they are with him on a common work do <br/>
not go away without asking his permission. Those who ask thy permis¬ <br/>
sion are they who believe in God and His apostle. And if they ask thy <br/>
permission in some business of theirs, give leave to whom thou wilt of them <br/>
and ask God’s pardon for them. God is forgiving, merciful.’ 1 This passage <br/>
came down concerning those Muslims who desired the good and respected <br/>
it, and obeyed God and His apostle. </p>
<p>Then God said of the disaffected who were stealing away from the work <br/>
and leaving it without the prophet’s permission, ‘Do not treat the call of <br/>
the apostle among you as if it were one of you calling upon another. God <br/>
knows those of you who steal away to hide themselves. Let those who <br/>
conspire to disobey his order beware lest trouble or a painful punishment <br/>
befall them’ (696). ‘Verily to God belong heaven and earth. He knows 671 <br/>
what you are doing’ the man who speaks the truth and the man who lies. <br/>
‘And (He knows) the day they will be returned to Him when He will tell <br/>
them what they did, for God knows all things.’ </p>
<p>The Muslims worked at the trench until they had finished it, and they <br/>
made a jingle about one of the Muslims called Ju‘ayl whom the apostle <br/>
had named ‘Amr, saying, </p>
<p>He changed his name from Ju'ayl to ‘Amr <br/>
And was a help to the poor man that day. </p>
<p>When they came to the word ‘Amr the apostle said “Amr’, and when they <br/>
came to ‘help’ he said ‘help’. 2 </p>
<p>I have heard some stories about the digging of the trench in which there <br/>
is an example of God’s justifying His apostle and confirming his prophetic <br/>
office, things which the Muslims saw with their eyes. Among these stories <br/>
is one that I have heard that Jabir b. ‘Abdullah used to relate: When they <br/>
were working on the trench a large rock caused great difficulty, and they <br/>
complained to the apostle. He called for some water and spat in it; then <br/>
he prayed as God willed him to pray; then he sprinkled the water on the <br/>
rock. Those who were present said, ‘By Him who sent him a prophet with <br/>
the truth it was pulverized as though it were soft sand so that it could not <br/>
resist axe or shovel.’ </p>
<p>Sa‘id b. Mina told me that he was told that a daughter of Bashir b. Sa*d, <br/>
sister of al-Nu‘man b. Bashir, said: ‘My mother ‘Amra d. Rawaha called 67a <br/>
me and gave me a handful of dates which she put in my garment and told <br/>
me to take them to my father and my uncle ‘Abdullah b. Rawaha for their </p>

up into the forts. </p>
<p>The enemy of God Huyayy b. Akhtab al-Nadri went out to Ka'b b. Asad <br/>
al-Qurazi who had made a treaty with the apostle. When Ka'b heard of <br/>
Huyayy’s coming he shut the door of his fort in his face, and when he asked <br/>
permission to enter he refused to see him, saying that he was a man of ill <br/>
omen and that he himself was in treaty with Muhammad and did not intend <br/>
to go back on his word because he had always found him loyal and faithful. <br/>
Then Huyayy accused him of shutting him out because he was unwilling to <br/>
let him eat his corn. This so enraged him that he opened his door. He said, <br/>
‘Good heavens, Ka'b, I have brought you immortal fame and a great <br/>
army. I have come with Quraysh with their leaders and chiefs which I <br/>
have halted where the torrent-beds of Ruma meet; and Ghatafan with <br/>
their leaders and chiefs which I have halted in Dhanab Naqma towards <br/>
Uhud. They have made a firm agreement and promised me that they will <br/>
not depart until we have made an end of Muhammad and his men.’ Ka'b <br/>
said: ‘By God, you have brought me immortal shame and an empty cloud <br/>
which has shed its water while it thunders and lightens with nothing in it. </p>
<p>Woe to you Huyayy leave me (T. and Muhammad) as I am, for I have <br/>
always found him loyal and faithful.’ Huyayy kept on wheedling Ka'b until <br/>
at last he gave way in giving him a solemn promise that if Quraysh and <br/>
Ghatafan returned without having killed Muhammad he would enter his <br/>
fort with him and await his fate. Thus Ka'b broke his promise and cut <br/>
loose from the bond that was between him and the apostle. </p>
<p>When the apostle and the Muslims heard of this the apostle sent Sa'd b. <br/>
Mu'adh b. al-Nu'man who was chief of Aus at the time, and Sa'd b. 675 <br/>
'Ubada b. Dulaym, one of B. Sa'ida b. Ka'b b. Khazraj, chief of al-Khazraj <br/>
at the time, together with 'Abdullah b. Rawaha brother of B. al-Harith b. <br/>
al-Khazraj, and Khawwat b. Jubayr brother of B. 'Amr b. 'Auf, and told <br/>
them to go and see whether the report was true or not. ‘If it is true give me <br/>
an enigmatic message 1 which I can understand, and do not undermine the <br/>
people’s confidence; and if they are loyal to their agreement speak out <br/>
openly before the people.’ They went forth and found the situation even <br/>
more deplorable than they had heard; they spoke disparagingly of the <br/>
apostle, saying, ‘Who is the apostle of God ? We have no agreement or <br/>
undertaking with Muhammad.’ Sa'd b. Mu'adh reviled them and they <br/>
reviled him. He was a man of hasty temper and Sa'd b. 'Ubada said\to <br/>
him, ‘Stop insulting them, for the dispute between us is too serious for <br/>
recrimination.’ Then the two Sa'ds returned to the apostle and after salut¬ <br/>
ing him said: “Adal and al-Qara’ i.e. (It is) like the treachery of 'Adal and <br/>
al-Qara towards the men of al-Rajl', Khubayb and his friends. 2 The <br/>
apostle said ‘Allah akbarl Be of good cheer, you Muslims.’ </p>
<p>The situation became serious and fear was everywhere. The enemy came </p>

<p>Berlin, 1950, p. 132. a v.s. </p>
<p>454 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>at them from above and below until the believers imagined vain things, 1 <br/>
and disaffection was rife among the disaffected to the point that Mu'attib b. <br/>
Qusyahr brother of B. 'Amr b. 'Auf said, ‘Muhammad used to promise us <br/>
that we should eat the treasures of Chosroes and Caesar and today not one <br/>
of us can feel safe in going to the privy!’ (698). It reached such a point that <br/>
Aus b. Qayzi, one of B. Haritha b. al-Harith, said to the apostle, ‘Our <br/>
houses are exposed to the enemy’—this he said before a large gathering of <br/>
his people—-‘so let us go out and return to our home, for it is outside <br/>
676 Medina.’ The apostle and the polytheists remained twenty days and more, <br/>
nearly a month, without fighting except for some shooting with arrows, and <br/>
the siege. </p>
<p>When conditions pressed hard upon the people the apostle—according <br/>
to what 'Asim b. 'Umar b. Qatada and one whom I do not suspect told <br/>
me from Muhammad b. Muslim b. 'UbayduIIah b. Shihab al-Zuhri—sent <br/>
to 'Uyayna b. Hisn b. Hudhayfa b. Badr and to al-Harith b. 'Auf b. Abu <br/>
Haritha al-Murri who were leaders of Ghatafan and offered them a third <br/>
of the dates of Medina on condition that they would go back with their <br/>
followers and leave him and his men, so peace was made between them so <br/>
far as the writing of a document. It was not signed and was not a definite <br/>
peace, merely peace negotiations (T. and they did so). When the apostle <br/>
wanted to act he sent to the two Sa'ds and told them of it and asked their <br/>
advice. They said: ‘Is it a thing you want us to do, or something God has <br/>
ordered you to do which we must carry out? or is it something you are <br/>
doing for us?’ He said: ‘It is something I am doing for your sake. By God, <br/>
I would not do it were it not that I have seen the Arabs have shot at you <br/>
from one bow, and gathered against you from every side and I want to <br/>
break their offensive against you! Sa'd b. Mu'adh said: ‘We and these <br/>
people were polytheists and idolaters, not serving God nor knowing him, <br/>
and they never hoped to eat a single date (T. of ours) except as guests or <br/>
by purchase. Now, after God has honoured and guided us to Islam and <br/>
made us famous by you, are we to give them our property? We certainly <br/>
will not. We will give them nothing but the sword until God decide <br/>
between us.’ The apostle said: ‘You shall have it so.’ Sa'd took the paper <br/>
and erased what was written, saying, ‘Let them do their worst against us!’ </p>
<p>677 The siege continued without any actual lighting, but some horsemen of <br/>
Quraysh, among whom were 'Amr b. 'Abdu Wudd b. Abu Qays (699) <br/>
brother of B. 'Amir b. Lu’ayy; 'Ikrima b. Abu Jahl; Hubayra b. Abu <br/>
Wahb, both of Makhzum; pirar b. al-Khattab the poet, b. Mirdas brother <br/>
of B. Muharib b. Fihr donned their armour and went forth on horseback <br/>
to the stations of B. Kinana, saying, ‘Prepare for fighting and then you will <br/>
know who are true knights today.’ They galloped forward until they <br/>
stopped at the trench. When they saw it they exclaimed, ‘This is a device <br/>
which the Arabs have never employed!’ (700). </p>
<p>Then they made for a narrow part of the trench and beat their horses </p>

<p>Ah asked the prophet’s permission to fight him, even if he were 'Amr <br/>

<p>'Amr asked him who he was, and when he told him he said: ‘Let it be </p>
<p>456 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>one of your uncles who is older than you, my nephew, for I don’t want to <br/>
shed your blood.’ 'All answered, ‘But I do want to shed your blood.’ He <br/>
became angry, and drew his sword which flashed like fire, and advanced in <br/>
his anger (it is said that he was mounted). 'All said to him, ‘How can I <br/>
fight you when you are on a horse ? Dismount and be on a level with me.’ <br/>
So he got off his horse and came at him and 'All advanced with his shield. <br/>
'Amr aimed a blow which cut deeply into the shield so that the sword <br/>
stuck in it and struck his head. But 'All gave him a blow on the vein at the <br/>
base of the neck and he fell to the ground. The dust rose and the apostle </p>
<p>S. ii, 191 heard the cry, ‘Allah Akbar’ and knew that ‘All had killed him. [Suhayli </p>
<p>continues:] As he came towards the apostle smiling with joy 'Umar asked <br/>
him if he had stripped him of his armour, for it was the best that could be <br/>
found among the Arabs. He answered: ‘When I had struck him down he <br/>
turned his private parts towards me and I felt ashamed to despoil him and <br/>
moreover he h#d said that he did not want to shed my blood because my <br/>
father was a friend of his.’] 1 </p>
<p>T. 1476 [T. With 'Amr were killed two men, Munabbih b. 'Uthman b. 'Ubayd </p>
<p>b. al-Sabbaq b. 'Abdu’l-Dar who was hit by an arrow and died in Mecca; <br/>
and of B. Makhzum Naufal b. 'Abdullah b. al-Mughira who had stormed <br/>
the trench and rolled down into it and they stoned him. He called out, ‘O <br/>
Arabs, Death is better than this,’ so ‘All went down to him and dispatched <br/>
him. The Muslims got possession of his body and asked the apostle to let <br/>
them sell his effects. He told them that he had no use for his effects or the <br/>
price they would fetch, and it was their affair; and he left them a free <br/>
hand.] </p>
<p>'All said concerning that: </p>
<p>In his folly he fought for the stone pillars 2 <br/>
While I fought for the Lord of Muhammad rightly. </p>
<p>I rejoiced when I left him prone <br/>
Like a stump between sand and rocks. </p>
<p>I forbore to tkke his garments 3 </p>
<p>Though had I been the vanquished he would have taken mine. </p>
<p>Do not imagine, you confederates, that God <br/>
Will desert His religion and His prophet (701). </p>
<p>1 This incident is reported by I.H., Suh., T. S. Nas., and al-Mawardi, 64, all of them <br/>
saying that it was not reported by I.H. in the form given above. I. S. Nas says it was not in <br/>
the riiuaya of al-Bakka’i. Mawardi adds the details (a) that the three challenges of 'Amr were <br/>
issued on three successive days; ( b ) that he called out to Muhammad. His version seems <br/>
to be the original, as there is more point in the taunt: ‘What’s the matter when none of you <br/>
will advance to get his reward from his Lord (by being killed) or send an enemy to hell?’ <br/>
He ends: ‘They circled round each other and the dust rose so that it hid them from sight. <br/>
When it cleared away there wa9 'Ali wiping his sword on 'Amr’s garments and he was slain.’ <br/>
Miwardi took this from a written source, because he says that I.H. narrated the story in his <br/>
Maghazi. </p>
<p>2 i.e, the idols. </p>
<p>3 The point of this is made clear in the extract from I.I.’s Maghazi and TVs quotation <br/>
from 1 . 1 . As the Sir a of I.H, stands it is left in the air. </p>

<p>Tkrima b. Abu Jahl threw away his spear as he was running from 'Amr, <br/>
so Hassan b. Thabit said: </p>
<p>As he fled he threw his spear to us. </p>
<p>Perhaps, Tkrima, you have not done such a thing before ? </p>
<p>As you turned your back you ran like an ostrich </p>
<p>Turning neither to right nor left. </p>
<p>You didn’t turn your back as a human being would, </p>
<p>The back of your neck was like a young hyaena’s (702). </p>
<p>Abu Layla 'Abdullah b. Sahl b. 'AbduTRahman b. Sahl al-Ansari, <br/>
brother of B. Haritha, told me that 'A’isha was in the fort of B. Haritha on <br/>
that day. It was one of the strongest forts of Medina. The mother of Sa'd <br/>
b. Mu'adh was with her. 'A’isha said: ‘This was before the veil had been <br/>
imposed upon us. Sa'd went by wearing a coat of mail so short that the <br/>
whole of his forearm was exposed. He hurried along carrying a lance, 679 <br/>
saying the while, </p>
<p>Wait a little! Let Hamal 1 see the fight. </p>
<p>What matters death when the time is right ? </p>
<p>His mother said, “Hurry up, my boy, for by God you are late.” I said to <br/>
her, “I wish that Sa'd’s coat of mail were longer than it is”, for I was afraid <br/>
for him where the arrow actually hit him. Sa'd was shot by an arrow <br/>
which severed the vein of his arm. The man who shot him, according to <br/>
what 'Asim b. 'Umar b. Qatada told me, was Hibban b. Qays b. al-'Ariqa, 2 <br/>
one of B. 'Amir b. Lu’ayy. When he hit him he said, “Take that from me, <br/>
the son of al-'Ariqa.” 2 Sa'd said to him, “May God make your face sweat <br/>
farraq) in hell. O God, if the war with Quraysh is to be prolonged spare <br/>
me for it, for there is no people whom I want to fight more than those who <br/>
insulted your apostle, called him a liar, and drove him out. O God, seeing <br/>
that you have appointed war between us and them grant me martyrdom <br/>
and do not let me die until I have seen my desire upon B. Qurayza.” * </p>
<p>One whom I do not suspect told me from 'Abdullah b. Ka'b b. Malik <br/>
that he used to say: ‘The man who hit Sa'd that day was Abu Usama al- <br/>
Jushaml, an ally of B. Makhzum. This Abu Usama composed an ode <br/>
about it with reference to Tkrima b. Abu Jahl: </p>
<p>O Tkrima, why did you blame me when you said </p>
<p>Khalid be your ransom in the forts of Medina ? </p>
<p>Am I not he who inflicted a bloody wound on Sa'd ? </p>
<p>The vein where the elbow bends gushed with his blood. </p>
<p>Sa'd died of it and the grey-haired matrons </p>
<p>And the high-breasted virgins made loud lamentation. </p>
<p>You are the one who protected him when 'Ubayda 3 </p>

<p>680 Yahya b. 'Abbad b. ‘Abdullah b. al-Zubayr from his father 'Abbad told <br/>
me as follows: Saflya d. 'Abdu’l-Muttalib was in Fari', the fort of Hassan <br/>
b. Thabit. She said: ‘Hassan was with us there with the women and <br/>
children, when a Jew came along and began to go round the fort. The B. <br/>
Qurayza had gone to war and cut our communications with the apostle, <br/>
and there was no one to protect us while the apostle and the Muslims were <br/>
at the enemy’s throats unable to leave them to come to us if anyone turned <br/>
up. I told Hassan that he could see this Jew going round the fort and I <br/>
feared that he would discover our weakness and inform the Jews who were <br/>
in our rear while the apostle and his companions were too occupied to <br/>
help us, so he must go down and kill him. “God forgive you,” he said. <br/>
“You know quite well that I am not the man to do that.” When he said <br/>
that and I saw that no help was to be expected from him I girded myself 2 <br/>
and took a club, and went down to him from the fort above and hit him <br/>
with the club until I killed him. This done I went back to the fort and told <br/>
Hassan to go down and strip him: I could not do it myself because he was <br/>
a man. He said, “I have no need to strip him, Bint 'Abdu’l-Muttalib/” 3 <br/>
As God has described, 4 the apostle and his companions remained in fear <br/>
and difficulty when the enemy came on them from above and below. Then <br/>
Nu'aym b. Mas'ud b. 'Amir b. Unayf b. Tha'laba b. Qunfud b. Hilal b. <br/>
Khalawa b. Ashja' b. Rayth b. Ghatafan came to the apostle saying that he <br/>
had become a Muslim though his own people did not know of it, and let <br/>
681 him give him what orders he would. The apostle said: ‘You are only one <br/>
man among us, so go and awake distrust among the enemy to draw them <br/>
off us if you can, for war is deceit/ Thereupon Nu'aym went off to B. <br/>
Qurayza with whom he had been a boon companion in heathen days, and <br/>
reminded them of his affection for them and of the special tie between <br/>
them. When they admitted that they did not suspect him he said: ‘Quraysh <br/>
and Ghatafan are not like you: the land is your land, your property, your <br/>
wives, and your children are in it; you cannot leave it and go somewhere <br/>
else. Now Quraysh and Ghatafan have come to fight Muhammad and his <br/>
companions and you have aided them against him, but their land, their </p>
<ul>
<li>Or, reading marghub, 'made off to avoid trouble’. </li>
</ul>
<p>2 Or, reading i'tajartu, 'fastened my veil’. </p>
<p>3 The commentators do not like this story to the discredit of one of the prophet’s com¬ <br/>
panions. Suhayli says that the learned reject the tradition because the isnad is broken off. <br/>
Further, had the story of ffassSn’s cowardice been true the poets who satirized him would <br/>
have mentioned it. As they did not the tradition must be weak. On the other hand, if it is <br/>
sound, it may be that fjassan was ill on that day and could not fight. Al-Zarqani, who <br/>
believes the story, discounts the argument that rival poets would have used the story had it <br/>
been true by saying that the fact that he was a companion of the prophet saved him, and <br/>
their silence on the subject is one of the ‘marks of prophecy’. </p>
<p>4 Sura 33. 10. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 459 </p>
<p>property, and their wives are not here, so they are not like you. If they <br/>
see an opportunity they will make the most of it; but if things go badly <br/>
they will go back to their own land and leave you to face the man in your <br/>
country and you will not be able to do so if you are left alone. So do not <br/>
fight along with these people until you take hostages from their chiefs who <br/>
will remain in your hands as security that they will fight Muhammad with <br/>
you until you make an end of him.’ The Jews said that this was excellent <br/>
advice. </p>
<p>Then he went to Quraysh and said to Abu Sufyan b. Harb and his <br/>
company: ‘You know my affection for you and that I have left Muhammad. <br/>
Now I have heard something which I think it my duty to tell you of by way <br/>
of warning, but regard it as confidential.’ When they said that they would, <br/>
he continued: ‘Mark my words, the Jews have regretted their action in <br/>
opposing Muhammad and have sent to tell him so, saying: “Would you <br/>
like us to get hold of some chiefs of the two tribes Quraysh and Ghatafan <br/>
and hand them over to you so that you can cut their heads off? Then we <br/>
can join you in exterminating the rest of them.’ He has sent w r ord back to <br/>
accept their offer; so if the Jews send to you to demand hostages, don’t <br/>
send them a single man.’ </p>
<p>Then he went to Ghatafan and said: You are my stock and my family, <br/>
the dearest of men to me, and I do not think that you can suspect me/ <br/>
They agreed that he was above suspicion and so he told the same story as 682 <br/>
he had told Quraysh. </p>
<p>On the night of the sabbath of Shawwal a.h. 5 it came about by God’s <br/>
action on behalf of His apostle that Abu Sufyan and the chiefs of Ghatafan <br/>
sent 'Ikrima b. Abu Jahl to B. Qurayza with some of their number saying <br/>
that they had no permanent camp, that the horses and camels were dying; <br/>
therefore they must make ready for battle and make an end of Muhammad <br/>
once and for all. They replied that it was the sabbath, a day on which they <br/>
did nothing, and it was well known what had happened to those of their <br/>
people who had violated the'sabbath. ‘Moreover we will not fight Muham¬ <br/>
mad along with you until you give us hostages whom we can hold as <br/>
security until we make an end of Muhammad; for we fear that if the <br/>
battle goes against you and you suffer heavily you will withdraw at once to <br/>
your country and leave us while the man is in our country, and we cannot <br/>
face him alone.’ When the messengers returned with their reply Quraysh <br/>
and Ghatafan said (T. Now you know) that what Nu'aym told you is the <br/>
truth; so send to B. Qurayza that we will not give them a single man, and <br/>
if they want to fight let them come out and fight. Having received this <br/>
message B. Qurayza said: ‘What Nu'aym told you is the truth. The people <br/>
are bent on fighting and if they get an opportunity they will take advantage <br/>
of it; but if they do not they will withdraw to their own country and leave <br/>
us to face this man here. So send word to them that we will not fight <br/>
Muhammad with them until they give us hostages.’ Quraysh and Ghatafan <br/>
refused to do so, and God sowed distrust between them, and sent a bitter </p>
<p>460 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>cold wind against them in the winter nights which upset their cooking-pots <br/>
and overthrew their tents. </p>
<p>When the apostle learned of their dispute and how God had broken up <br/>
their alliance he called Hudhayfa b. al-Yaman and sent him to them to <br/>
see what the army w r as doing at night. </p>
<p>683 Yazld b. Ziyad told me from Muhammad b. Ka'b b. al-QurazI: A man <br/>
of Kufa said to Hudhayfa, ‘Did you really see the apostle and were you his <br/>
companion ?’ When he replied Yes, he asked what they used to do, and he <br/>
said that they used to live a hard life. He said, ‘By God, if we had lived in <br/>
his day we would not have allowed him to set foot on the ground, but <br/>
would have carried him on our shoulders.’ Hudhayfa said, ‘I can see us <br/>
with the apostle at the trench as he prayed for a part of the night and then <br/>
turned to us and said, “Who will get up and see for us what the army is <br/>
doing and then return—the apostle stipulating that he should return—I <br/>
wall ask God that he shall be my companion in paradise.” Not a single man <br/>
got up because of his great fear, hunger, and the severe cold. When no one <br/>
got up the apostle called me, and I had to get up when he called me. He <br/>
told me to go and see what the army w r as doing and not to do anything <br/>
else 1 until I returned to him. So I went out and mingled with the army <br/>
while the wind and God’s troops were dealing w'ith them as they did, <br/>
leaving neither pot, nor fire, nor tent standing firm. Abu Sufyan got up <br/>
and said, “O Quraysh, let every man see who is sitting next him.” So I <br/>
took hold of the man w r ho was at my side and asked him who he was and he <br/>
said So-and-so. </p>
<p>‘Then Abu Sufyan said: “O Quraysh, we are not in a permanent camp; <br/>
the horses and camels are dying; the B. Qurayza have broken their word to <br/>
us and we have heard disquieting reports of them. You can see the <br/>
violence of the wind which leaves us neither cooking-pots, nor fire, nor <br/>
tents to count on. Be off, for I am going!” Then he went to his camel <br/>
which was hobbled, mounted it, and beat it so that it got up on its three <br/>
legs; by God its hobble was not freed until it was standing. 2 Were it not <br/>
that the apostle had enjoined me not to do anything else until I returned to <br/>
him, if I washed I could have killed him with an arrow. </p>
<p>‘I returned to the apostle as he was standing praying in a wrapper be- </p>
<p>684 longing to one of his wives (704). When he saw me he made me come in <br/>
to sit at his feet and threw the end of the wrapper over me; then he bowed <br/>
and prostrated w r hile I was in it (T. And I disturbed him). When he had <br/>
finished I told him the news. When Ghatafan heard of what Quraysh had <br/>
done they broke up and returned to their own country.’ </p>
<p>In the morning the apostle and the Muslims left the trench and returned <br/>
to Medina, laying their arms aside. </p>
<p>1 i.c. not to act on his own initiative. </p>
<p>3 The Arabs still hobble their camels when they are kneeling with their legs folded <br/>
beneath them. One of the forelegs is tied by the halter in the folded position. If the camel <br/>
gets up before the hobble is undone one leg is perforce doubled up and cannot be put to <br/>
the ground. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>461 </p>
<p>THE RAID ON B. QURAYZA </p>
<p>According to what al-Zuhrl told me, at the time of the noon prayers <br/>
Gabriel came to the apostle wearing an embroidered turban and riding on <br/>
a mule with a saddle covered with a piece of brocade. He asked the apostle <br/>
if he had abandoned fighting, and when he said that he had he said that <br/>
the angels had not yet laid aside their arms and that he had just come from <br/>
pursuing the enemy. ‘God commands you, Muhammad, to go to B. <br/>
Qurayza. I am about to go to them to shake their stronghold.’ </p>
<p>The prophet ordered it to be announced that none should perform the <br/>
afternoon prayer until after he reached B. Qurayza (705). ^ The apostle <br/>
sent ‘All forward with his banner and the men hastened to it. 'All advanced <br/>
until when he came near the forts he heard insulting language used of the <br/>
apostle. He returned to meet the apostle on the road and told him that it <br/>
was not necessary for him to come near those rascals. The apostle said, <br/>
‘Why? I think you must have heard them speaking ill of me,’ and when <br/>
*Ali said that that was so he added, ‘If they saw me they would not talk in <br/>
hat fashion.’ When the apostle approached their forts he said, ‘You <br/>
mothers of monkeys, has God disgraced you and brought His vengeance <br/>
upon you?’ They replied, ‘O Abu’KQasim, you are not a barbarous </p>
<p>person.’ </p>
<p>The apostle passed by a number of his companions in al-Saurayn before <br/>
he got to B. Qurayza and asked if anyone had passed them. They replied 685 <br/>
that Dihya b. Khalifa al-Kalbl had passed upon a white mule with a saddle <br/>
covered with a piece of brocade. He said, ‘That was Gabriel who has been <br/>
sent to B. Qurayza to shake their castles and strike terror to their hearts.’ </p>
<p>When the apostle came to B. Qurayza he halted by one of their w^ells <br/>
near their property called The Well of Ana (706). The men joined him. <br/>
Some of them came after the last evening prayer not having prayed the <br/>
afternoon prayer because the apostle had told them not to do so until he <br/>
got to B. Qurayza. They had been much occupied with warlike prepara¬ <br/>
tions and they refused to pray until they came to B. Qurayza in accordance <br/>
with his instructions and they prayed the afternoon prayer there alter the <br/>
last evening prayer. God did not blame them for that in His book, nor did <br/>
the apostle reproach them. My father Ishaq b. Yasar told me this tradition <br/>
from Ma'bad b. Malik al-Ansari. </p>
<p>The apostle besieged them for twenty-five nights until they were sore <br/>
pressed and God cast terror into their hearts. </p>
<p>NowHuyayy b. Akhtab had gone with B. Qurayza into their forts when <br/>
Quraysh and Ghatafan had wdthdrawn and left them, to keep his w-ord to <br/>
Ka'b b. Asad; and when they felt sure that the apostle tvould not leave <br/>
them until he had made an end of them Ka'b b. Asad said to them. O <br/>
Jews, you can see what has happened to you; I offer you three alternatives. <br/>
Take which you please.’ (i) We will follow this man and accept him as <br/>
true, for by God it has become plain to you that he is a prophet who has </p>
<p>462 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>been sent and that it is he that you find mentioned in your scripture; and <br/>
then your lives, your property, your women and children will be saved. <br/>
They said, ‘We will never abandon the laws of the Torah and never change </p>
<p>686 it for another.’ He said, ‘Then if you won’t accept this suggestion (ii) let <br/>
us kill our wives and children and send men with their swords drawn to <br/>
Muhammad and his companions leaving no encumbrances behind us, until <br/>
God decides between us and Muhammad. If we perish, we perish, and we <br/>
shall not leave children behind us to cause us anxiety. If we conquer we <br/>
can acquire other wives and children.’ They said, ‘Should we kill these <br/>
poor creatures? What would be the good of life when they were dead?’ <br/>
He said, ‘Then if you will not accept this suggestion (iii) tonight is the eve <br/>
of the sabbath and it may well be that Muhammad and his companions <br/>
will feel secure from us then, so come down, perhaps we can take Muham¬ <br/>
mad and his companions by surprise.’ They said: ‘Are we to profane our <br/>
sabbath and do on the sabbath what those before us of whom you well <br/>
know did and were turned into apes?’ He answered, ‘Not a single man <br/>
among you from the day of your birth has ever passed a night resolved to <br/>
do what he knows ought to be done.’ </p>
<p>Then they sent to the apostle saying, ‘Send us Abu Lubaba b. 'Abdu’l- <br/>
Mundhir, brother of B. 'Amr b. 'Auf (for they were allies of al-Aus), that <br/>
we may consult him.’ So the apostle sent him to them, and when they saw <br/>
him they got up to meet him. The women and children went up to him <br/>
weeping in his face, and he felt sorry for them. They said, ‘Oh Abu <br/>
Lubaba, do you think that we should submit to Muhammad’s judgement?’ <br/>
He said, ‘Yes,’ and pointed with his hand to his throat, signifying slaughter. <br/>
Abu Lubaba said, ‘My feet had not moved from the spot before I knew <br/>
that I had been false to God and His apostle.’ Then he left them and did <br/>
not go to the apostle but bound himself to one of the pillars in the mosque <br/>
saying, ‘I will not leave this place until God forgives me for what I have <br/>
done,’ and he promised God that he would never go to B. Qurayza and <br/>
would never be seen in a town in which he had betrayed God and His <br/>
apostle (707). </p>
<p>687 When the apostle heard about him, for he had, been waiting for him a <br/>
long time, he said, ‘If he had come to me I would have asked forgiveness <br/>
for him, but seeing that he behaved as he did I will not let him go from his <br/>
place until God forgives him.’ Yazid b. ‘Abdullah b. Qusayt told me that <br/>
the forgiveness of Abu Lubaba came to the apostle at dawn while he was <br/>
in the house of Umm Salama. She said: ‘At dawn I heard the apostle laugh <br/>
and I said: ‘Why did you laugh? May God make you laugh!’ He replied, <br/>
‘Abu Lubaba has been forgiven.’ She said, ‘Cannot I give him the good <br/>
news ?’ and when he said that she could she went and stood at the door of <br/>
her room 1 (this was before the veil had been prescribed for women) and <br/>
said, ‘O Abu Lubaba, rejoice, for God has forgiven you’; and men rushed <br/>
out to set him free. .He said,.‘No, not until the apostle frees me with his </p>
<p>1 The prophet’8 house was next door to the mosque where Abu Lubaba had tied himself. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 463 </p>
<p>own hand.’ When the apostle passed him when he was going out to <br/>
morning prayer he set him free (708). </p>
<p>Tha'laba b. Sa'ya, Usayd his brother, and Asad b. 'Ubayd of B. Hadl <br/>
who were not related to B. Qurayza or B. al-Nadir (their pedigree is far <br/>
above that), accepted Islam the night on which B. Qurayza surrendered to <br/>
the apostle’s judgement. </p>
<p>On that night 'Amr b. Su'da al-Qurazi went out and passed the apostle’s <br/>
guards commanded that night by Muhammad b. Maslama who challenged <br/>
him. Now Amr had refused to join B. Qurayza in their treachery towards <br/>
the apostle, saying, ‘I will never behave treacherously towards Muham- 688 <br/>
mad.’ When Muhammad b. Maslama recognized him he said/O God, do <br/>
not deprive me (of the honour) of setting right the errors of the noble’ and <br/>
let him go his way. He went as far as the door of the apostle’s mosque 1 in <br/>
Medina that night; then he vanished, and it is not known to this day where <br/>
he went. When the apostle was told he said, ‘That is a man whom God <br/>
delivered because of his faithfulness.’ Some people allege that he was <br/>
bound with a rotten rope along with the captives of B. Qurayza when they <br/>
submitted to the apostle s judgement, and his old rope was found cast away <br/>
none knowing whither he went and the apostle then said those words. God <br/>
knows what really happened. </p>
<p>In the morning they submitted to the apostle’s judgement and al-Aus <br/>
leapt up and said, ‘O Apostle, they are our allies, not allies of Khazraj, and <br/>
you know how you recently treated the allies of our brethren.’ Now the <br/>
apostle had besieged B, Qaynuqa who were allies of al-Khazraj and when <br/>
they submitted to his judgement 'Abdullah b. Ubayy b. Salul had asked <br/>
him for them and he gave them to him; so when al-Aus spoke thus the <br/>
apostle said. Will you be satisfied, O Aus, if one of your own number <br/>
pronounces judgement on them?’ When they agreed he said that Sa'd b. </p>
<p>Mu adh was the man. The apostle had put Sa'd in a tent belonging to a <br/>
woman of Aslam called Rufayda inside his mosque. She used to nurse the <br/>
wounded and see to those Muslims who needed care. The apostle had told <br/>
his people when Sa'd had been wounded by an arrow at the battle of the <br/>
Trench to put him in Rufayda’s tent until he could visit him later. When <br/>
the apostle appointed him umpire in the matter of B. Qurayza, his people <br/>
came to him and mounted him on a donkey on which they had put a <br/>
leather cushion, he being a corpulent man. As they brought him to the <br/>
apostle they said, ‘Deal kindly with your friends, for the apostle has made <br/>
you umpire for that very purpose.’ When they persisted he said, ‘The time 689 <br/>
has come for Sa d in the cause of God, not to care for any man’s censure.’ </p>
<p>Some of his people who were there went back to the quarter of B. 'Abdu’l- <br/>
Ashhal and announced to them the death of B. Qurayza before Sa'd got to <br/>
them, because of what they had heard him say. </p>
<p>When Sa’d reached the apostle and the Muslims the apostle told them <br/>
to get up to greet their leader. The muhajirs of Quraysh thought that the </p>
<p>1 W. has ‘until he passed the night in’. </p>
<p>4 6 4 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>apostle meant the Ansar, while the latter thought that he meant everyone, <br/>
so they got up and said ‘0 Abu' Amr, the apostle has entrusted to you the <br/>
affair of your allies that you may give judgement concerning them, ba d <br/>
asked ‘Do you covenant by Allah that you accept the judgement 1 pro¬ <br/>
nounce on them ?’ They said Yes, and he said, ‘And is it incumbent on the <br/>
one who is here?’ (looking) in the direction of the apostle not mentioning <br/>
him out of respect, and the apostle answered Yes. Sa'd said Then I give <br/>
judgement that the men should be killed, the property divided, and the </p>
<p>women and children taken as captives. ,. , c &lt;, </p>
<p>'Asim b. 'Umar b. Qatada told me from 'Abdu’l-Rahman b. Amr b. ba d <br/>
b. Mu'adh from 'Alqama b. Waqqas al-Laythl that the apostle said to <br/>
Sa'd, ‘You have given the judgement of Allah above the seven heavens </p>
<p>^ Then they surrendered, and the apostle confined them in Medina in the <br/>
quarter of d. al-Harith, a woman of B. al-Najjar. Then the apostle went <br/>
out to the market of Medina (which is still its market today) and ug <br/>
600 trenches in it. Then he sent for them and struck off their heads m those <br/>
trenches as they were brought out to him in batches. Among t era was e <br/>
enemy of Allah Huyayy b. Akhtab and Ka'b b. Asad their chief. There <br/>
were 600 or 700 in all, though some put the figure as high as 800 or 900. <br/>
As they were being taken out in batches to the apostle they asked Ka b <br/>
what he thought would be done with them. He replied, ‘Will you never <br/>
understand ? Don’t you see that the summoner never stops and those, who <br/>
are taken away do not return? By Allah it is death!’ This went on until <br/>
the apostle made an end of them. </p>
<p>Huyayy was brought out wearing a flowered robe (710) in which he had <br/>
made holes about the size of the finger-tips in every part so that it should <br/>
not be taken from him as spoil, 1 with his hands bound to his neck by a rope. <br/>
When he saw the apostle he said, ‘By God, I do not blame myself for <br/>
opposing you, but he who forsakes God will be forsaken. Then he went <br/>
to the men and said, ‘God’s command is right. A book and a decree and <br/>
massacre have been written against the Sons of Israel. Then he sat down </p>
<p>and his head was struck off. </p>
<p>Jabal b. Jawwal al-Tha'labl said: </p>
<p>Ibn Akhtab did not blame himself </p>
<p>But he who forsakes God will be forsaken. </p>
<p>He fought until he justified himself </p>
<p>And struggled to the utmost in pursuit of glory. </p>
<p>Muhammad b. Ja'far b. al-Zubayr told me from 'Urwa b. al-Zubayr that <br/>
‘A’isha said: ‘Only one of their women was killed. She was actually with <br/>
me and was talking with me and laughing immoderately as the apostle <br/>
was killing her men in the market when suddenly an unseen voice calle </p>
<p>1 A variant ‘so that none should wear it after him’ is worth mention. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 465 </p>
<p>her name. ‘Good heavens,’ I cried, ‘what is the matter?’ ‘I am to be <br/>
killed,’ she replied. ‘What for?’ I asked. ‘Because of something I did,’ <br/>
she answered. She was taken away and beheaded. ‘A’isha used to say, ‘I <br/>
shall never forget my wonder at her good spirits and her loud laughter 691 <br/>
when all the time she knew' that she would be killed’ (711). </p>
<p>Ibn Shihab al-Zuhrl told me that Thabit b. Qays b. al-Shammas had <br/>
gone to al-Zabir b. Bata al-QurazI who was Abu 'Abdu’l-Rahman. Al- <br/>
Zabir had spared Thabit during the pagan era. One of al-Zabir’s sons told <br/>
me that he had spared him on the day of Bu'ath, having captured him <br/>
and cut off his forelock and then let him go. Thabit came to him (he was <br/>
then an old man) and asked him if he knew him, to which he answered, </p>
<p>‘Would a man like me not recognize a man like you ?’ He said, ‘I want to <br/>
repay you for your service to me.’ He said, ‘The noble repays the noble.’ </p>
<p>Thabit went to the apostle and told him that al-Zabir had spared his life <br/>
and he wanted to repay him for it, and the apostle said that his life would <br/>
be spared. When he returned and told him that the apostle had spared <br/>
his life he said, ‘What does an old man without family and without children <br/>
want with life ?’ Thabit went again to the apostle, who promised to give <br/>
him his wife and children. When he told him he said, ‘How can a <br/>
household in the Hijaz live without property ?’ Thabit secured the apostle’s <br/>
promise that his property would be restored and came and told him so, <br/>
and he said, ‘O Thabit, what has become of him whose face was like a <br/>
Chinese mirror in which the virgins of the tribe could see themselves, </p>
<p>Ka'b b. Asad ?’ ‘Killed,’ he said. ‘And what of the prince of the Desert <br/>
and the Sown, Huyayy b. Akhtab?’ ‘Killed.’ ‘And what of our vanguard <br/>
when we attacked and our rearguard when we fled (T. returned to the <br/>
charge), 'Azzal b. Samaw’al?’ ‘Killed.’ ‘And what of the two assemblies?’ <br/>
meaning B. Ka'b b. Qurayza and B. 'Amr b. Qurayza. ‘Killed.’ He said, </p>
<p>‘Then I ask of you, Thabit, by my claim on you that you join me with <br/>
my people, for life holds no joy now that they are dead, and I cannot bear <br/>
to wait another moment 1 to meet my loved ones.’ So Thabit went up to 692 <br/>
him and struck off his head. </p>
<p>When Abu Bakr heard of his words ‘until I meet my loved ones’ he said, </p>
<p>‘Yes, by Allah he will meet them in hell for ever and ever’ (712). </p>
<p>(Thabit b. Qays said concerning that, mentioning al-Zabir b. Bata: T&lt; 1496 </p>
<p>My obligation is ended; I was noble and persistent <br/>
When others swerved from steadfastness. </p>
<p>Zabir had a greater claim than any man on me <br/>
And when his wrists were bound with cords <br/>
I went to the apostle that I might free him. </p>
<p>The apostle was a very sea of generosity to us.) </p>
<p>The apostle had ordered that every adult of theirs should be killed. </p>
<p>1 Lit. ‘the time it takes a man to pour a bucket of water into the trough and return the <br/>
bucket’. </p>
<p>B 4080 H h </p>
<p>466 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Shu'ba b. al-Hajjaj told me from ‘Abdu’l-Malik b. 'Umavr from 'Atiya <br/>
al-Qurazi: The apostle had ordered that every adult of B. Qurayza should <br/>
be killed. I was a lad and they found that I was not an adult and so they <br/>
let me go. </p>
<p>Ayyub b. r Abduu’I-Rahman b. 'Abdullah b. Abu Sa'sa'a brother of B. <br/>
'Adly b. al-Najjar told me that Salma d. Qays, mother of al-Mundhir sister <br/>
of Salit b. Qays—she w r as one of the maternal aunts of the apostle who had <br/>
prayed with him both towards Jerusalem and towards Mecca and had <br/>
sw r orn the allegiance of women to him—asked him for Rifa'a b. Sarnaw’al <br/>
al-Qurazi wiio was a grow r n man who had sought refuge with her, and w r ho <br/>
used to know them. She said that he had alleged that he w r ould pray and <br/>
eat camel’s flesh. So he gave him to her and she saved his life. </p>
<p>Then the apostle divided the property, wives, and children of B. Qurayza <br/>
among the Muslims, and he made knowm on that day the shares of horse </p>
<p>693 and men, and took out the fifth. A horseman got three shares, tw'O for the <br/>
horse and one for his rider. A man without a horse got one share. On the <br/>
day of B. Qurayza there w^ere thirty-six horses. It w r as the first booty on <br/>
which lots w : ere cast and the fifth was taken. According to its precedent <br/>
and what the apostle did the divisions w^ere made, and it remained the <br/>
custom for raids. </p>
<p>Then the apostle sent Sa'd b. Zayd al-Ansarl brother of b. ‘Abdu’I- <br/>
Ashhal with some of the captive w’omen of B. Qurayza to Najd and he sold <br/>
them for horses and weapons. </p>
<p>The apostle had chosen one of their women for himself, Rayhana d. <br/>
'Amr b. Khunafa, one of the women of B. 'Amr b. Qurayza, and she <br/>
remained with him until she died, in his powder. The apostle had proposed <br/>
to marry her and put the veil on her, but she said: ‘Nay, leave me in your <br/>
power, for that will be easier for me and for you.’ So he left her. She had <br/>
shown repugnance towards Islam wTen she was captured and clung to <br/>
Judaism. So the apostle put her aside and felt some displeasure. While <br/>
he was with his companions he heard the sound of sandals behind him and <br/>
said, ‘This is Tha'laba b. Sa'ya coming to give me the good news of <br/>
Rayhana’s acceptance of Islam’ and he came up to announce the fact. <br/>
This gave him pleasure. </p>
<p>God sent down concerning the trench and B. Qurayza the account w'hich <br/>
is found in the sura of the Confederates 1 in w r hich He mentioned their trial <br/>
and His kindness to them, and His help when He removed that from them <br/>
after one of the disaffected had said what he did: ‘O you who believe, <br/>
remember God’s favour to you when armies came against you, and We <br/>
sent against them a w r ind and armies you could not see, and God is a seer <br/>
of what you do.’ The armies w r ere Quraysh, and Ghatafan, and B. Qurayza. </p>
<p>694 The armies which God sent with the wind w r ere the angels. God said, <br/>
‘When they came at you from above you and below r you, and when eyes <br/>
grew wild and hearts reached to the throats and you thought vain things </p>

<p>promised them. Then He said: ‘Some of the believers are men who are <br/>
true to what they covenanted with Allah and some of them have fulfilled <br/>
their vow in death,’ i.e. finished their work and returned to their Lord like <br/>
those who sought martyrdom at Badr and Uhud (715). </p>
<p>696 ‘And some of them are still waiting,’ i.e. for the help which Allah <br/>
promised them and the martyrdom like that which befell his companions. <br/>
God said: ‘And they have not altered in the least,’ i.e. they did not doubt <br/>
nor hesitate in their religion, and did not change it for another. ‘That God <br/>
may reward the true men for their truth and punish the disaffected if He <br/>
will, or repent towards them. God is forgiving, merciful. And Allah <br/>
turned back those who disbelieved in their wrath,’ i.e. Quraysh and Ghata- <br/>
fan. ‘They gained no good. God averted battle from the believers, and <br/>
Allah is strong, mighty. And He brought down those of the Scripture <br/>
people who helped them,’ i.e. B. Qurayza, ‘from their strongholds’ the </p>
<p>697 forts and castles in which they were (716). ‘And he cast terror into their <br/>
hearts; some you slew and some you captured,’ i.e. he killed the men and <br/>
captured the women and children. ‘And caused you to inherit their land <br/>
and their dwellings, and their property, and a land you had not trod,’ i.e, <br/>
Khaybar. ‘For Allah can do all things.’ </p>
<p>When the affair of B. Qurayza was disposed of, Sa'd’s wound burst open <br/>
and he died a martyr therefrom. </p>
<p>Mu'adh b. Rifa'a al-Zuraqi told me: Anyone you like from the men of </p>
<p>698 my people told me that Gabriel came to the apostle when Sa'd was taken, <br/>
in the middle of the night wearing an embroidered turban, and said, <br/>
‘O Muhammad, who is this dead man for whom the doors of heaven <br/>
have been opened and at whom the throne shook ?’ The apostle got up <br/>
quickly dragging his garment as he went to Sa'd and found him already <br/>
dead. </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr told me from 'Amra d. 'Abdu’I-Rahman: As <br/>
'A’isha was returning from Mecca with Usayd b. Hudayr he heard of the <br/>
death of a wife of his, and showed considerable grief. 'A’isha said: ‘God <br/>
forgive you, O Abu Yahya, will you grieve over a woman when you have <br/>
lost the son of yojir uncle, for whom the throne shook ?’ </p>
<p>One I do not suspect told me from al-Hasan al-Basrl: Sa'd was a fat man <br/>
and whefi the men carried him they found him light. Some of the dis¬ <br/>
affected said, ‘He was a fat man and we have never carried a lighter bier <br/>
than his.’ When the apostle heard of this he said, ‘He had other carriers <br/>
as well. By Him Who holds my life in His hand the angels rejoiced at <br/>
(receiving) the spirit of Sa'd and the throne shook for him.’ </p>
<p>Mu'adh b. Rifa'a told me from Mahmud b, 'Abdu’l-Rahman b. ‘Amr <br/>
b. al-Jamuh from Jabir b. 'Abdullah: When Sa'd was buried as we were <br/>
with the apostle he said Subhdna llah and we said it with him. Then he <br/>
said Allah akbar and the men said it with him. When they asked him why <br/>
he had said Subhdna'Hah he said ‘The grave was constricted on this good <br/>
man until God eased him from it’ (717). </p>

<p>POETRY ABOUT THE TRENCH AND B. QURAYZA </p>
<p>Dirar b. al-Khattab b. Mirdas brother of B. Muharib b. Fihr said about <br/>
the battle of the Trench: </p>
<p>Many a sympathetic woman had doubts about us, 1 <br/>
Yet we led a great force, crushing all before us. </p>
<p>Its size w r as as Uhud </p>
<p>When one could see its whole extent. </p>
<p>You could see the long mail upon the warriors </p>
<p>And their strong leather shields </p>
<p>And the fine steeds like arrows </p>
<p>Which we discharged against the sinful wrongdoers. </p>
<p>W 7 hen we charged the one the other, </p>
<p>’Twas as though at the gap in the trench men would shake hands. <br/>
You could not see a rightly guided man among them <br/>
Though they said: ‘Are we not in the right?’ </p>
<p>We besieged them for one whole month <br/>
Standing over them like conquerors. </p>
<p>701 Night and morning every day <br/>
We attacked them fully armed; </p>
<p>Sharp swords in our hands <br/>
Cutting through heads and skulls. </p>
<p>’Twas as though their gleam when they were drawn <br/>
When they flashed in the hands of those that drew them <br/>
Was the gleam of lightning illuminating the night <br/>
So that one could see the clouds clearly. </p>
<p>But for the trench which protected them <br/>
We would have destroyed them one and all. </p>
<p>But there it stood in front of them, </p>
<p>And they took refuge in it from fear of us. </p>
<p>' Though we withdrew we left </p>
<p>Sa'd hostage to death in front of their tents. </p>
<p>When darkness came you could hear the keening women <br/>
Raising their lament over Sa'd. </p>
<p>Soon we shall visit you again <br/>
Helping one another as we did before <br/>
With a company of Kinana armed <br/>
Like lions of the jungle protecting their dens. </p>
<p>Ka'b b. Malik brother of B. Salima answered him: </p>
<p>Many a woman will ask of our fight. </p>
<p>Had she been there she would have seen we were steadfast. </p>
<p>1 If this poem is really Dirar’s it must have been composed after Sura 33, for it uses the <br/>
language of verse 10. It is hardly likely that a Muslim would have boasted of the doings of <br/>
Quraysh, or that a polytheist would have borrowed language from the Quran. Therefore it <br/>
would seem to be a sort of literary Aunt Sally, put up to be assailed in the poems that <br/>
follow. </p>
<p>47 1 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>W e were steadfast trusting in Him; </p>
<p>We saw nothing equal to God in the hour of our danger. </p>
<p>We have a prophet, a true helper, </p>
<p>By whom we can conquer all men. </p>
<p>We fought an evil disobedient people <br/>
Fully prepared in their hostile attack. </p>
<p>When they came at us we struck them blows <br/>
Which dispatched the precipitate. </p>
<p>You would have seen us in wide long mail which <br/>
Glittered like pools in the plain; </p>
<p>Sharp swords in our hands </p>
<p>By which we quench the spirit of the mischievous. </p>
<p>Like lions at the gap in the trench <br/>
Whose tangled jungle protects their lairs. </p>
<p>Our horsemen when they charged night and morning <br/>
Looked disdainfully at the enemy as they wore their badges <br/>
To help Ahmad and God so that we might he 702 </p>
<p>Sincere slaves of truth, </p>
<p>And that the Meccans might know when they came <br/>
And the people of different parties <br/>
That God has no partners, </p>
<p>And that He helps the believers. </p>
<p>Though you killed Sa'd wantonly, </p>
<p>God’s decrees are for the best. </p>
<p>He will admit him to goodly gardens <br/>
The resting-place of the righteous. </p>
<p>As He repulsed you, runaway fugitives, </p>
<p>Fruitless, disgraced, despite your rage. </p>
<p>Disgraced, you accomplished nothing there <br/>
And were all but destroyed <br/>
By a tempest which overtook you <br/>
So that you were blinded by its force. </p>
<p>‘Abdullah b. al-Ziba'ra al-Sahml said about the trench: </p>
<p>Salute the dwelling whose vestiges </p>
<p>Long decay and time’s changes have effaced. </p>
<p>’Tis as though their remains were the writings of Jews <br/>
Except the zarebas and (marks of) tentpegs. 1 <br/>
A desert as though you did not find diversion in it <br/>
Happily with young girls of one age. </p>
<p>But speak no more of a life that has passed <br/>
And a place become ruined and deserted, </p>
<p>And gratefully remember the gallantry of all </p>
<p>1 The trace of an old camp (rasm) is compared to Hebrew script. The word also means </p>
<p>writing . </p>
<p>472 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Who marched from the sacred stones, 1 <br/>
The stones of Mecca, making for Yathrib, </p>
<p>With a loud-throated mighty force; </p>
<p>Leaving the high ground well used paths <br/>
In every conspicuous height and pass; </p>
<p>The fine lean steeds led beside them <br/>
Thin in belly, lean of flank, </p>
<p>Foaled from long-bodied mares and stallions, </p>
<p>Like a wolf who attacks careless watchmen. </p>
<p>‘Uyayna marched with the banner of the army; </p>
<p>Sakhr led the confederates; </p>
<p>Two chiefs like the moon in its splendour, </p>
<p>The help of the poor, the refuge of the fugitive, </p>
<p>703 Until when they came to Medina </p>
<p>And girt themselves for death their sharp swords drawm. </p>
<p>For forty days they had the best of Muhammad <br/>
Though his companions in war were the best. </p>
<p>They called for withdrawal the morning you said <br/>
‘We are almost done for.’ </p>
<p>But for the trench they would have left them <br/>
Corpses for hungry birds and wolves. </p>
<p>Hassan b. Thabit answered him and said: </p>
<p>Can the vanished traces of a deserted place <br/>
Answer one who addresses it ? </p>
<p>A desert where clouds of rain have effaced its traces <br/>
And the constant blowing of every high wind ? •" </p>
<p>Yet have I seen their dwellings adorned by <br/>
Shining faces, heirs of a glorious past. </p>
<p>But leave the dwellings, the talk of lovely maidens <br/>
With soft breasts, sw'eet in converse, </p>
<p>And complain to God of cares and what you see— </p>
<p>An angry people who wronged the apostle, </p>
<p>Who marched with their company against him <br/>
And collected townsmen and desert dwellers, </p>
<p>The army of 'Uyayna and Ibn Harb <br/>
Mingled with the horsemen of the confederates <br/>
Until they came to Medina and hoped to slay <br/>
The apostle’s men and plunder them, </p>
<p>And attacked us in their strength. </p>
<p>They were put to flight in their fury </p>
<p>By a tempest which dispersed their company </p>
<p>1 The an$db may mean either the stones set up to mark the boundary of the sacred terri¬ <br/>
tory, such as remain to this day, or the stones at which the sacrificial victims were slaugh¬ <br/>
tered. </p>
<p>473 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>And the armies of thy Lord the Lord of lords. </p>
<p>God averted battle from the believers 1 <br/>
And gave them the best of rewards. </p>
<p>When they had abandoned hope, our bounteous King <br/>
Sent down His aid and scattered them; </p>
<p>Gave ease to Muhammad and his companions <br/>
And humiliated every lying doubter, </p>
<p>Hard-hearted, suspicious, doubtful, </p>
<p>Not men of pure life, unbelievers. </p>
<p>May misery cling to their hearts, for <br/>
In unbelief they persisted to the very end. 2 </p>
<p>Ka'b b. Malik also answered him: 704 </p>
<p>War has left over to us </p>
<p>The best gift of our bounteous Lord; </p>
<p>High white forts and resting-places for camels where [from their <br/>
rubbing] </p>
<p>Palms are black and where milk is plentiful. </p>
<p>They are like lava tracts and their bounty is lavished <br/>
On the visiting guest and relative.- 3 <br/>
And horses 4 swift as wolves <br/>
Fed on barley and cut lucerne </p>
<p>With hairless fetlocks and firm-fleshed hindquarters, </p>
<p>Smooth their coats from head to tail; </p>
<p>Long-neckcd, answering the View hallo <br/>
As hounds speed to the huntsman’s call. </p>
<p>Now guarding the tribesman’s cattle, </p>
<p>Now slaying the enemy and returning with the spoil, </p>
<p>Scaring wild beasts, swift in war, </p>
<p>Grim in combat, of noble spirit, </p>
<p>Well fed and sleek </p>
<p>Well fleshed yet thin bellied. </p>
<p>They bring coats of mail doubly woven <br/>
With strong spears which hit the mark, </p>
<p>And swords whose rust the polishers have removed; </p>
<p>1 Almost an exact quotation from Sura 33. 25. </p>
<p>2 Or, To whose hearts misery has clung </p>
<p>So that their hearts persist in disbelief to the end of time. </p>
<p>3 A.Dh.’s explanation implies: </p>
<p>High white forts and resting-places for camels <br/>
Where the camels have black necks and are rich in milk. </p>
<p>They (the resting places) are like lava tracts <br/>
Their bounty, &amp;c. </p>
<p>S. renders ma'dtin ‘palm plantations’ and judhu ‘trunks’ and then has to take ahldb as <br/>
a metaphor of ‘fruit.’ </p>
<p>The verse is difficult, but it is possible to avoid unnatural metaphors in its translation. </p>
<p>The dung of the camels made the ground look like a lava tract. </p>
<p>4 nazai arc horses imported from elsewhere. </p>
<p>474 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>All with a splendid highborn knight, </p>
<p>His right hand holding a spear ready for the thrust <br/>
Whose fashioning was entrusted to Khabbab. </p>
<p>The glitter of his lance is like <br/>
A flash of flame in the darkness of the night, </p>
<p>And a force whose mail defies the arrows <br/>
And repels the bolts that would pierce the thighs. </p>
<p>Reddish-black, massed, as though their spears <br/>
Were a blazing forest in every encounter, </p>
<p>Seeking the shadow of the standard as though <br/>
On the shaft of the spear there was the shadow of a hawk. </p>
<p>Their courage defeated Abu Karib and Tubba' </p>
<p>And their gallantry overcame the Bedouin. </p>
<p>We were guided by admonitions from our Lord <br/>
On the tongue of one radiant and pure. </p>
<p>They were laid before us and we loved to remember them <br/>
After they had been laid before the confederates (and rejected). </p>
<p>705 Axioms which evildoers assert they thought too strict <br/>
But the wise understand. </p>
<p>Quraysh came to contend with their Lord, </p>
<p>But he who contends with the Conqueror will surely be conquered (723). </p>
<p>Ka'b b. Malik said about the trench: </p>
<p>Let one who enjoys the noise of battle where blows resound <br/>
Like the crackling of burning reeds, </p>
<p>Come to the fight where swords are sharp <br/>
Between al-Madhad 1 and the side of the trench. </p>
<p>They were bold in smiting champions <br/>
And surrendered their lifeblood to the Lord of the world <br/>
In a company by which God helped His prophet <br/>
And was gracious to His servant. </p>
<p>All in long mail w'hose ends swept the ground, </p>
<p>Looking like an undulating pool blown by the wind <br/>
With mail well wrought and woven as though its nails <br/>
Were the eyes of a locust in the chain rings. </p>
<p>Braced up by the belt of a sword <br/>
Of pure steel, cutting, and shining. </p>
<p>Such with piety was our clothing on the day of battle 2 <br/>
And every hour that called for bravery. </p>
<p>When our swords were too short to meet the enemy <br/>
We made them reach by going forward. </p>
<p>You could see skulls split asunder, </p>
<p>1 The place where the trench was dug, Some say that it was between Sal' and the </p>
<p>trench. </p>
<p>3 Borrowed from Sura 7. 25, ‘The clothing of piety is the best 1 . </p>
<p>475 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>To say nothing of hands, as though they had not been created. </p>
<p>We met the enemy with a compact force <br/>
Driving away their force who went as though to the top of al- <br/>
Mashriq. 1 </p>
<p>Against the enemy we prepared <br/>
Every swift, bay, white-legged, piebald horse <br/>
Carrying riders who in battle were like <br/>
Lions on damp dewy soil, 2 </p>
<p>Trusty ones who bring death to brave men 706 </p>
<p>With death-dealing spears beneath the clouds of dust. </p>
<p>God commanded that the horses should be kept for His enemy in the <br/>
fight 3 </p>
<p>(Truly God is the best guarantor of victory) </p>
<p>That they might vex the enemy and protect the dwellings <br/>
If the horses of the miscreants came near. </p>
<p>God the mighty helped us with His strength <br/>
And loyal steadfastness on the day of the encounter. </p>
<p>We obeyed our prophet’s orders. </p>
<p>When he called for war we were the first to respond. </p>
<p>When he called for violent efforts we made them. </p>
<p>When we saw the battle we hastened thither. </p>
<p>He who obeys the prophet’s command (let him do so), for among us <br/>
He is obeyed and truly believed. </p>
<p>By this He will give us victory and show our glory <br/>
And so give us a life of ease. </p>
<p>Those who call Muhammad a liar </p>
<p>Disbelieve and go astray from the way of the pious (724). </p>
<p>Ka'b also said: </p>
<p>The mixed tribes knew when they gathered together against us <br/>
And attacked our religion that we would not submit. </p>
<p>Confederates from Qays b. 'Aylan and Khindif with one accord <br/>
Made common cause, not knowing what would happen. </p>
<p>They tried to turn us from our religion while we </p>
<p>Tried to turn them from disbelief, but God is a seer and a hearer. </p>
<p>When they raged against us in battle <br/>
The all embracing help of God aided us. </p>
<p>’Twas God’s protection and His grace towards us <br/>
(He whom God does not guard is lost). </p>
<p>He guided us to the true religion and chose it for us. </p>
<p>God can do more than man can do. </p>
<p>1 A mountain between al-Sarif and al-QasIm in L)abba country. </p>
<p>1 In such conditions lions are said to be most fierce, presumably because wet ground <br/>
would ruin the scent of their prey and so they would be ravenous. </p>
<p>3 Cf. Sura 8. 62. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>476 </p>
<p>Ka'b also said: </p>
<p>707 Tell Quraysh that Sal' </p>
<p>And the land between al-'Urayd and al-Sammad 1 <br/>
Is a land where camels w r ho know war carry water, </p>
<p>Where wells dug in the days of 'Ad abound. </p>
<p>Still waters fed by copious fountains <br/>
That keep the wells at a steady depth. </p>
<p>The tangled growth and the rushes there <br/>
Seem to rustle when they yellow at the harvest. </p>
<p>Our trade does not consist in selling donkeys <br/>
To the land of Daus or Murad. </p>
<p>Ours is a land w'ell tilled, for it we fight <br/>
If you have stomach for the battle. </p>
<p>We ploughed and planted it as peasants do; </p>
<p>Never have you seen a valley bordered like it. </p>
<p>We have kept every fine high-standing <br/>
Powerful courser for great objects. </p>
<p>Respond to our invitation <br/>
For clear statement and truth, </p>
<p>Or take the blows you will get from us <br/>
At the side of al-Madhad. </p>
<p>We will meet you with all our warriors <br/>
And well made tractable horses, </p>
<p>And bloodmares whose sides throb <br/>
Like the beating of a locust’s wfings 2 <br/>
Swift of limb, firm fleshed, </p>
<p>Perfectly made from head to tail. </p>
<p>Horses which live through famine years <br/>
When other men’s horses die; </p>
<p>Which tug at the reins, turning their necks to one side, 3 <br/>
When their master calls them to war. </p>
<p>When our warners say: ‘Be ready’ </p>
<p>We put our trust in the Lord of men. </p>
<p>And we said: ‘Nothing will ease our troubles <br/>
But smiting the helmets and desperate fighting.’ </p>
<p>You have seen none among those we fought, </p>
<p>Whether townsmen or tribesmen, </p>
<p>Bolder than we were in attack <br/>
Nor gentler in affection. </p>
<p>When we tied with trusty knots <br/>
Fine coats of mail upon them </p>
<p>708 Into long armour we put every fierce noble warrior </p>
<p>1 All these places are in the neighbourhood of Medina. </p>
<p>2 An unusually fast-flying species of locust is meant. </p>
<p>3 This hemistich is repeated verbatim in the poem attributed to Niassan in W. 829. 8. </p>
<p>477 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Careful in his preparation for battle; </p>
<p>Haughty as an angry lion <br/>
When someone appears in his valley, </p>
<p>Who shatter the skull of the doughtiest warrior <br/>
With the middle of a sword carried loose on its lanyard. </p>
<p>That we may make Thy religion victorious, O God. </p>
<p>We are in Thy hand, so guide us in the right paths (725). </p>
<p>Musafi' b. 'Abdu Manaf b. Wahb b. Hudhafa b. Jumah, weeping for <br/>
'Amr b. 'Abdu Wudd and mentioning how 'All killed him, said: </p>
<p>'Amr b. 'Abd was the first horseman to cross Mad had <br/>
And he was the horseman of Yalyal. 1 <br/>
Mild in nature, noble, firm, </p>
<p>Seeking armed combat, never showing fear. </p>
<p>You knew that when they fled from you <br/>
Ibn Abd only hurried not <br/>
Until the best fighters surrounded him <br/>
Seeking untiringly to kill him. </p>
<p>On SaP’s sides the spears surrounded <br/>
A horseman who w r as no unarmed coward. </p>
<p>You asked Ghalib’s horseman to dismount, O 'All, </p>
<p>On Safi’s sides. Would he had not done so. </p>
<p>Away with you, 'All! Never have you overcome his like in renown <br/>
Nor coped with such a difficult task. </p>
<p>My life be a ransom for the horseman of Ghalib <br/>
Who met death unperturbed, </p>
<p>He who crossed al-Madhad with his mare <br/>
Seeking to avenge the men he \yould not desert. </p>
<p>Musafi' also said, reproaching the horsemen of 'Amr who decamped and <br/>
deserted him: </p>
<p>'Amr b. 'Abd and the fine horses he led— </p>
<p>Horses led for him and horses shod— </p>
<p>His horsemen decamped and his clan left 709 </p>
<p>A great pillar, the first among them. </p>
<p>Marvel as I may I saw it </p>
<p>When you, 'AH, asked 'Amr to dismount he dismounted. </p>
<p>Be not far, 2 for I have suffered by his death <br/>
And till I die I have a burden heavy to bear. </p>
<p>Hubayra who was despoiled turned his back in flight <br/>
Fearing the fight lest they should be killed. </p>
<p>And Dirar who had shown courage </p>
<p>Fled like a miserable unarmed wretch (726). </p>
<p>1 A wadi in Badr. </p>
<p>1 The dead are thus apostrophized. </p>
<p>478 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Hubayra b. Abu Wahb making excuses for his flight, weeping for 'Amr, <br/>
and mentioning how 'All killed him, said: </p>
<p>On my life, I did not turn my back </p>
<p>On Muhammad and his companions in cowardice or fear of death; <br/>
But I considered my position and could find <br/>
No advantage in sword or arrow if I used them. </p>
<p>I stopped, and when I could not go forward <br/>
I withdrew like a strong lion with his cubs, </p>
<p>Who turns his shoulder from his adversary when <br/>
He can find no way to return to the fray—such has always been my <br/>
way. </p>
<p>Be not far, O 'Amr, alive or dead. </p>
<p>Such as you deserves the highest praise from one like me <br/>
Who (now) will drive on horses checked by spears <br/>
Be not far, O 'Amr alive or dead. </p>
<p>You have gone (from us) full of praise, noble of ancestry. </p>
<p>Tell of his glory when the camels bellow loudly? 1 <br/>
Had Ibn 'Abd been there he would have gone to them <br/>
And relieved them, that never ignoble man. </p>
<p>Away with you, 'All, never have I seen one who behaved like you <br/>
Against a brave man advancing like a stallion. </p>
<p>Never have you achieved such a proud boast. </p>
<p>As long as you live you can feel safe from stumbling thereby. </p>
<p>Hubayra also said: </p>
<p>The noblest man of Lu’ayy b. Ghalib knows <br/>
That when misfortune came their knight was 'Amr. </p>
<p>7jo Their knight was 'Amr and 'All asked him to dismount. </p>
<p>(The lion must seek his enemy.) </p>
<p>He was their knight when 'All called to him <br/>
When the squadrons basely left him. </p>
<p>Alas that I left 'Amr in Yathrib. </p>
<p>May misfortunes never cease there! </p>
<p>Hassan b. Thabit boasting of the killing of 'Amr b. 'Abdu Wudd <br/>
said: </p>
<p>‘Amr, the last of you, we slew with the lance <br/>
As we defended Yathrib with our small force. </p>
<p>We killed you with our Indian swords, </p>
<p>For we are masters of war when we attack. </p>
<p>We killed you in Badr too </p>
<p>And left your tribes threading their way through the dead (727). </p>
<p>1 So loud was his voice that he could be heard above the grumbling of the camels, as he <br/>
boasted of his tribe’s prowess. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 479 </p>
<p>Hassan also said: </p>
<p>The warrior 'Amr b. 'Abd is on the flanks of Yathrib <br/>
Requiring to be avenged: he was not given respite. 1 <br/>
You found our swords drawn <br/>
And you found our horses ready. </p>
<p>At Badr you met a band </p>
<p>Who smote you with no weakling’s blow. </p>
<p>No more will you be summoned on the day of great things <br/>
Or to important distasteful tasks, O 'Amr! (727) </p>
<p>Hassan also said: </p>
<p>Give Abu Hidm a message, </p>
<p>One with which the camels hasten. </p>
<p>Am I your friend in every hardship <br/>
And another your friend in a time of ease ? </p>
<p>You have a witness who saw 7 me </p>
<p>Lifted up to him as a child is carried (728). </p>
<p>HassSn said concerning B. Qurayza mourning Sa'd b. Mu'adh and 711 <br/>
mentioning his judgement concerning the former: </p>
<p>Tears streamed from my eyes, </p>
<p>’Tis right that they should weep for Sa'd <br/>
Lying on the battlefield. Eyes that flow with tears <br/>
Suffer his loss without ceasing. </p>
<p>Slain in God’s religion, he inherits paradise with martyrs, </p>
<p>Theirs a noble company. </p>
<p>Though you have said farewell and left us </p>
<p>And lie in the dusty darkness of the grave </p>
<p>You, O Sa'd, have returned (to God) with a noble testimony </p>
<p>And garments of honour and praise. </p>
<p>By pronouncing on the two tribes of Qurayza the (same) judge¬ <br/>
ment </p>
<p>Which God had decreed against them you did not judge of your own <br/>
volition. </p>
<p>Your judgement and God’s were at one </p>
<p>And you did not forgive when you were reminded of a covenant. </p>
<p>Though fate has brought you to your death </p>
<p>Among those who sold their lives for everlasting gardens </p>
<p>Yet blessed is the state of the true ones </p>
<p>When they arc summoned to God for favour and regard. </p>
<p>1 The reading in the Diu-dn xcv is easier but not necessarily original: </p>
<p>‘'Amr . . . lay dead </p>
<p>Vengeance for liim is not to be expected.’ </p>
<p>480 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Hass an also said mourning Sa'd and the prophet’s companions who were <br/>
martyred and mentioning their merits: </p>
<p>0 my people, is there any defence against what is decreed ? </p>
<p>And can the good old days return? </p>
<p>When I call to mind an age that is passed <br/>
My heart is troubled and my tears flow; </p>
<p>Yearning sorrow reminds me of friends </p>
<p>Now dead, among them Tufayl and Rafi' and Sa'd. </p>
<p>They have gone to paradise </p>
<p>And their houses are empty and the earth is a desert without them. </p>
<p>They were loyal to the apostle on the day of Badr </p>
<p>While over them swords flashed amid the shades of death. </p>
<p>When he called them they answered loyally, </p>
<p>All of them obeyed him utterly. </p>
<p>They gave no ground till all were dead. </p>
<p>(Only battles cut short the allotted span.) </p>
<p>7 12 Because they hoped for his intercession </p>
<p>Since none but prophets can intercede. </p>
<p>That, O best of men, is what we did, </p>
<p>Our response to God while death is certain. </p>
<p>Ours was the first step to thee, and the last of us <br/>
Will follow the first in God’s religion. </p>
<p>We know that the kingdom is God’s alone <br/>
And that the decree of God must come to pass. 1 </p>
<p>Hassin also said about B. Qurayza: </p>
<p>Qurayza met their misfortune <br/>
And in humiliation found no helper. </p>
<p>A calamity worse than that which fell B. al-Nadlr befell them <br/>
The day that God’s apostle came to them like a brilliant moon, </p>
<p>With fresh horses bearing horsemen like hawks. </p>
<p>We left them with the blood upon them like a pool <br/>
They having accomplished nothing. </p>
<p>They lay prostrate with vultures circling round them. </p>
<p>Thus are the obstinate and impious rewarded. </p>
<p>Warn Quraysh of a like punishment from God <br/>
If they will take my warning. </p>
<p>Hassan also said: </p>
<p>Qurayza met their misfortune </p>
<p>And shameful humiliation befell their castles. </p>
<p>Sa'd had warned them, saying <br/>
Your God is a majestic Lord, </p>
<p>1 Ditodn cxxxii. Obviously this dates from a later age. ‘The good old days’ are idealized. </p>

<p>They soon broke their treaty so that <br/>
The apostle slew them in their town. </p>
<p>With our troops he surrounded their fort <br/>
Which resounded with cries from the heat of the battle. </p>
<p>Hassan also said: </p>
<p>May the people who helped Quraysh miss one another, 1 <br/>
For in their land they have no helper. </p>
<p>They were given the scripture and wasted it, </p>
<p>Being blind, straying from the Torah. </p>
<p>You disbelieved in the Quran and yet 7*3 </p>
<p>You had been given confirmation of what the wamer said. </p>
<p>The nobles of B. Lu’ayy took lightly <br/>
The great conflagration in al-Buwayra. 2 </p>
<p>Abu Sufyan b. al-Harith b. 'Abdu’l-Muttalib answered him: </p>
<p>May God make that deed immortal, </p>
<p>May fire burn in its quarters I </p>
<p>You shall know which of us is far (from the fire) </p>
<p>And which of our lands will be harmed. </p>
<p>Had the palms therein been horsemen </p>
<p>They would have said, ‘You have no place here, be off!’ 3 </p>
<p>Jabal b. Jawwal al-Tha'labl also answered him, mourning al-Nadlr and <br/>
Qurayza: </p>
<p>O Sa'd, Sa'd of B. Mu'adh, </p>
<p>For what befell Qurayza and al-Nadlr. </p>
<p>By thy life, Sa'd of B. Mu'adh </p>
<p>The day they departed was indeed steadfast. </p>
<p>As for al-Khazraji Abu Hubab 4 <br/>
He told Qaynuqa* not to go. </p>
<p>The allies got Usayd in exchange for Hudayr <br/>
(For circumstances sometimes change.) 5 </p>
<p>1 This is the reading of C. W. has ta'aqada against tafdqada. </p>
<ul>
<li>A place belonging to B. al-Na^ir (not Qurayza) according to Yaqut, s.v. It was their <br/>
tree* which Muhammad destroyed. </li>
</ul>
<p>J The meaning of this poem is that the fact that B. al-Nadir were able to withdraw with all <br/>
their effects deserves to be immortalized and may the site they left be destroyed by fire. </p>
<p>The last line means ‘could the trees have been made to walk you Muslims would have got <br/>
rid of them tool’ Yftqut gives a different turn to all this and the preceding poem. I^assan'a <br/>
line above is put into the mouth of Abti Sufy&amp;n in the form: </p>
<p>‘The B. Lu’ayy took hardly the great conflagration at al-Buwayra’, <br/>
and the first line of Abu SufySn’s poem is given to Hassan in the form: </p>
<p>‘May God make that conflagration permanent!’ </p>
<p>But 1 , 1 . was right. Later writers thought that the ‘deed’ must be the-burning of the trees <br/>
and therefore the line must have been spoken by a Muslim. See further W. Arafat, op. jyi., <br/>

<p>7H the killing of sallam ibn abu’l-huqayq </p>
<p>When the fight at the trench and the affair of the B. Qurayza were over, the <br/>
matter of Sallam b. Abu’l-Huqayq known as Abu Rafi came up in co - <br/>
nexion with those who had collected the mixed tribes together against the <br/>
apostle Now Aus had killed Ka'b b. al-Ashraf before Uhud because of <br/>
hil enmity towards the apostle and because he instigated men a g a,n« him <br/>
so Khazraj asked and obtained the apostle s permission to kill ballam who </p>
<p>W Muhfmma b d a b. Muslim b. Shihab al-Zuhri from 'Abdullah b. Ka'b b, <br/>
Malik told me: One of the things which God did for His apos e w <br/>
these two tribes of the Ansar, Aus and Khazraj, competed the one wrth <br/>
the other like two stallions: if Aus did anything to the apostle s ad ' a " 1 ^ <br/>
Khazraj would say, 'They shall not have this superiority over us m the <br/>
apostle’s eyes and in Islam’ and they would not rest until they cou d </p>
<p>something similar. If Khazraj did anything Aus wou ' Khazrai </p>
<p>When Aus had killed Ka'b for his enmity towards the apostle, khazraj <br/>
used these words and asked themselves what man was as hostile to th <br/>
apostle as Ka'b ? And then they remembered Sallam who was in Khay <br/>
and asked and obtained the apostle’s permission to kill him. </p>
<p>Five men of B. Salima of Khazraj went to him: Abdullah b Atik <br/>
Mas'ud b. Sinan; 'Abdullah b. Unays; Abu Qatada al-Hanth b. Rib 1; and <br/>
Khuza'T b. Aswad, an ally from Aslam. As they left, the apostle a PP°‘" ,e <br/>
'Abdullah b. 'Atik as their leader, and he forbade them to ki w ° m <br/>
children. When they got to Khaybar they went to Sallam s house byn.ghg <br/>
having locked every door in the settlement on the inhabitants Now he was <br/>
T I37 8 in an upper chamber of his to which a (T- Roman) ladder led up. They </p>

<p>mounted this until they came to the door and asked to be allowed to come <br/>
in. His wife came out and asked who they were and they told her that they <br/>
were Arabs in search of supplies. She told them that their man was here 715 <br/>
and that they could come in. When we entered 1 we bolted the door of the <br/>
room on her and ourselves fearing lest something should come between us <br/>
and him. His wife shrieked and warned him of us, so we ran at him with <br/>
our swords as he was on his bed. The only thing that guided us in the <br/>
darkness of the night was his whiteness like an Egyptian blanket. When <br/>
his wife shrieked one of our number would lift his sword against her; then <br/>
he would remember the apostle’s ban on killing women and withdraw his <br/>
hand; but for that we would have made an end of her that night. When <br/>
we had smitten him with our swords 'Abdullah b. Unays bore down with <br/>
his sw r ord into his belly until it went right through him, as he was saying <br/>
Qatni, qatni, i.e. It’s enough. </p>
<p>We went out. Now 'Abdullah b. 'Atik had poor sight, and fell from the <br/>
ladder and sprained his arm (729) severely, so we carried him until we <br/>
brought him to one of their water channels and went into it. The people <br/>
lit lamps and went in search of us in all directions until, despairing of find¬ <br/>
ing us, they returned to their master and gathered round him as he was <br/>
dying. We asked each other how we could know that the enemy of God <br/>
was dead, and one of us volunteered to go and see; so off he went and <br/>
mingled with the people. He said, ‘I found his wife and some Jews gathered <br/>
round him. She had a lamp in her hand and was peering into his face and <br/>
saying to them ‘Bv God, I certainly heard the voice of 'Abdullah b. 'Atik. <br/>
Then I decided I must be wrong and thought “How can Ibn 'Atik be in <br/>
this country?” ’ Then she turned towards him, looking into his face, and <br/>
said, ‘By the God of the Jews he is dead!’ Never have I heard sweeter <br/>
words than those. </p>
<p>Then he came to us and told us the new T s, and we picked up our com¬ <br/>
panion and took him to the apostle and told him that we had killed God’s <br/>
enemy. W ,r e disputed before him as to who had killed him, each of us laying <br/>
claim to the deed. The apostle demanded to see our swords and when he <br/>
looked at them he said, ‘It is the sword of 'Abdullah b. Unays that killed <br/>
him; I can see traces of food on it.’ </p>
<p>Hassan b. Thabit mentioning the killing of Ka'b and Sallam said: 716 </p>
<p>God, what a fine band you met, </p>
<p>O Ibnu’l-Huqayq and Ibnu’l-Ashraf! </p>
<p>They went to you with sharp swords, </p>
<p>Brisk as lions in a tangled thicket, </p>
<p>Until they came on you in your dwelling </p>
<p>1 The change into the first person without any mention of the speaker’s authority is <br/>
significant. Doubtless there are occasions when the actual words used at a particular time <br/>
and place have been carefully stored in a hearer’s memory; but it should always be borne <br/>
in mind that oratio obliqua is abhorrent to Semitic writers who escape into the oratio recta <br/>
at the first opportunity. </p>

<p>'AMR B. AL-'AS AND KHALID B, AL-WALlD ACCEPT ISLAM </p>
<p>Yazid b. Abu Habib from Rashid client of Habib b. Abu Aus al-Thaqafl <br/>
from Habib told me that 'Amr b. al-'As told him from his own mouth: <br/>
When we came away from the trench with the mixed tribes I gathered <br/>
some of Quraysh together, men who shared my opinion and would listen <br/>
to me, and said: ‘You know that in my opinion this affair of Muhammad <br/>
will go to unheard-of lengths and I should like to know what you think of <br/>
my opinion. I think that we ought to go to the Negus and stay with him. <br/>
If Muhammad conquers our people we shall be with the Negus and we <br/>
should prefer to be subject to his authority rather than to Muhammad; on <br/>
the other hand, if our people get the upper hand they know us and will <br/>
treat us well.’ They thought that mj 7 suggestion was excellent so I told <br/>
them to collect something that we could take as a present to him; as leather <br/>
was the product of our land which he most valued we collected a large <br/>
quantity and took it to him. </p>
<p>While we were with him who should come to him but f Amr b. Umayya <br/>
al-Qamri whom the apostle had sent concerning Ja‘far and his companions. <br/>
He had an audience with the Negus, and when he came out I said to my <br/>
717 companions that if I were to go to the Negus and ask him to let me have <br/>
him, he would give him to me and we could cut off his head; and when I <br/>
had done that Quraysh would see that I had served them well in killing <br/>
Muhammad’s messenger. So I went in to the Negus and did obeisance as <br/>
■was my wont. He welcomed me as a friend and asked if I had brought <br/>
anything from our country, and when I told him that I had brought a large <br/>
quantity of leather and produced it he was greatly pleased and coveted it. <br/>
Then I said, ‘O King, I have just seen a man leave your presence. He is <br/>
the messenger of an enemy of ours, so let me have him that I may kill him, <br/>
for he has killed some of our chiefs and best men.’ He was enraged, and <br/>
stretching out his hand he gave his nose such a blow that I thought he <br/>
would have broken it. If the earth had opened I would have gone into it to <br/>
escape his anger. I said that had I known that my request would have been <br/>
distasteful to him I would not have made it. He said, ‘Would you ask me <br/>
to give you the messenger of a man to whom the great Namus comes as he <br/>
used to come to Moses, so that you might kill him!’ When I asked if he <br/>
were really so great he said: ‘Woe to you, ‘Amr, obey me and follow 7 him, <br/>
for by Allah he is right and will triumph over his adversaries as Moses <br/>
triumphed over Pharaoh and his armies.’ I asked him if he w r ould accept <br/>
my allegiance to Muhammad in Islam, and he stretched out his hand and <br/>
I gave my allegiance. When I W'ent out to my companions I had entirely <br/>
changed my mind, but I concealed my Islam from my companions. </p>

unhappy ending, and the evil appearance of man and beast. </p>
<p>The tradition about the raid on B. Lihyan is from Asim b. Umar b. <br/>
Qatada and 'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr from 'Abdullah b. Ka b b. Malik. <br/>
Ka'b b. Malik said: </p>
<p>If B. Libyan had waited </p>

<p>They would have met audacious warriors whose terror fills the way <br/>
In front of an irresistible force glittering like stars. </p>
<p>But they were as weasels w r ho stick to the </p>
<p>Clefts of the rocks 3 , which have no means of escape. </p>
<p>THE ATTACK ON DHU QARAD </p>
<p>The apostle had spent only a few nights in Medina when 'Uyayna b. Hi?n <br/>
b Hudhayfa b. Badr al-Fazarl with the cavalry of Ghatafan raided the <br/>
apostle’s milch-camels in al-Ghaba.* A man of B Ghifar who had his <br/>
wife with him, was in charge of the camels. Him they killed and carried <br/>
off his wife with the camels. </p>
<p>'Asim b. 'Umar b. Qatada and 'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr and a man I do <br/>
not suspect from 'Abdullah b. Ka'b b. Malik contributed to the story which <br/>
follows. The first to know of them was Salama b. Amr b. al-Akwa al- <br/>
Aslami. That morning he was making for al-Ghaba armed with bow and <br/>
arrows accompanied by a slave belonging to Talha b. Ubaydullah with a <br/>
horse which he was leading. When he got to the pass of al-VVada he saw <br/>
72o some of their cavalry and looked down in the direction of Sal. and cried <br/>
aloud, ‘O (what a) morning!’ Then he hurried off after the raiding party <br/>
like a lion. When he came up with them he began to keep them at bay <br/>
with arrows, saying as he shot: </p>
<p>Take that, al-Akwa'’s son am I. </p>
<p>Today, mean crowd, you die! </p>
<p>Whenever the horsemen made for him he fled from them; then back he <br/>
would come and take a shot at them when he could, saying the same words. <br/>
One of them said, ‘Our little Akwa' comes early in the morning!’ </p>
<p>1 Between Mecca and Medina, a wadi some eight miles from Usfan. </p>
<p>2 Or, with a different vowel, ‘the heart’. . _ „ . </p>
<p>J A variant is 'passes of Hijaz’. 4 Near Medina in the direction of Syria. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 487 </p>
<p>Ibnu’l-Akwa'’s call for aid reached the apostle and he ordered the alarm <br/>
to be sounded in Medina and the cavalry rallied to him. The first horse¬ <br/>
man to arrive was al-Miqdad b. 'Amr called b. al-Aswad, ally of B. Zuhra. </p>
<p>The next to arrive from the Ansar were 'Abbad b. Bishr b. Waqsh b. <br/>
Zughba b. Za'ura’, one of B. 'Abdu’I-Ashhal; Sa'd b. Zayd, one of B. Ka'b <br/>
b. 'Abdu’I-Ashhal; Usayd b. Zuhayr, brother of B. Haritha b. al-Harith, <br/>
though there is some doubt about him; 'Ukasha b. Mihsan, brother of B. <br/>
Asad b. Khuzayma; Muhriz b. Nadia, brother of B. Asad b. Khuzayma; </p>
<p>Abu Qatada al-Harith b. Rib'i, brother of B. Salima; and Abu 'Ayyash <br/>
who was 'Ubayd b. Zayd b. al-Samit, brother of B. Zurayq. When they <br/>
had gathered to the apostle, he set Sa'd b. Zayd over them according to my <br/>
information and told them to go in pursuit of the band until he himself <br/>
overtook them with the army. </p>
<p>I have heard from some men of B. Zurayq that the apostle had said to <br/>
Abu 'Ayyash: ‘How would it be if you were to give this horse to a man <br/>
who is a better rider than you and he caught up with the band ?’ He <br/>
replied: ‘I am the best horseman of the people! Then I beat the horse, <br/>
and by Allah he had not taken me fifty cubits before he threw me. I w r as <br/>
.astonished that the apostle should say that he washed that I had given him <br/>
to a better horseman and that I should have said that I w r as the best horse¬ <br/>
man.’ Men of B. Zurayq allege that the apostle gave Abu 'Ayyash’s horse 721 <br/>
to Mu'adh b. Ma'is, or to 'A’idh b. Ma'is b. Qays b. Khalada who was the <br/>
eighth. Some people count Salama b. 'Amr b. al-Akwa' as one of the eight <br/>
and exclude Usayd b. Zuhayr, but God knows what happened, seeing that <br/>
Salama was not riding that day but was the first to catch up with the band <br/>
on foot. The horsemen went in pursuit of the band until they overtook them. </p>
<p>'Asim b. 'Umar b. Qatada told me that the first horseman to catch up <br/>
with the band was Muhriz b. Nadia who was called ‘al-Akhram’ and <br/>
‘Qumayr’, and that when the alarm sounded a horse belonging to Mahmud <br/>
b. Maslama ran round the plantation when it heard the neighing of the <br/>
horses, for it was a treasured animal not put to work. When some women <br/>
of B. 'Abdu’l-Ashhal saw the horse running round the plantation with the <br/>
stump of wood to which it was tied they said: ‘How would you like to ride <br/>
this horse, Qumayr? You can see what it is like. Then you could overtake <br/>
the apostle and the Muslims.’ He agreed and they handed it over to him, <br/>
and he soon outstripped the rest of them because it was full of spirit. When <br/>
he overtook the band and came to a halt in front of them he said: ‘Stop, <br/>
you rascals, until the emigrants and Ansar who are behind you catch up <br/>
with you.’ One of them attacked and killed him. The horse wheeled and <br/>
they could not stop him until it stood by its stable among B. 'Abdu’l- <br/>
Ashhal. This man was the only Muslim to be killed (732). </p>
<p>Mahmud’s horse was called Dhu’l-Limma (733). </p>
<p>One whom I do not suspect told me from 'Abdullah b. Ka'b b. Malik <br/>
that Muhriz rode a horse of 'Ukasha’s called al-Janah. Muhriz 1 was killed 722 </p>
<p>1 C. has Mujazziz, but gives no authority for the reading. </p>
<p>488 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>,*-and al-Janah was captured. When the cavalry engaged, Abu Qatada al- <br/>
Harith b. Rib'I killed Habib b. 'Uyayna b. Hisn and covered him with his <br/>
mantle; then he joined his force. The apostle advanced with the Muslims <br/>
(734) and there was Habib covered with Abu Qatada’s mantle. The men <br/>
exclaimed, ‘We are God’s and to Him must we return! Abu Qatada has <br/>
been killed.’ The apostle said that it was not Abu Qatada but a man he <br/>
had killed and covered with his mantle so that they might know that he <br/>
was his prey. 'Ukasha overtook Aubar and his son 'Amr who were riding <br/>
the same camel, and ran them through with his lance, killing the two of <br/>
them at one stroke. They recovered some of the milch-camels. The <br/>
apostle went fonvard until he halted at the mountain of Dhu Qarad, and <br/>
the men joined him there, and he stopped there for a day and a night. <br/>
Salama b. al-Akwa' asked if he might go with a hundred men and recover <br/>
the rest of the herd and cut off the heads of the band. I have heard that <br/>
the apostle said, ‘By this time they are being served with their evening <br/>
drink among Ghatafan.’ The apostle divided a butchered camel among <br/>
every hundred men, and after a while he returned to Medina. The wife of <br/>
the Ghifari 1 came upon one of the apostle’s she-camels and told him what <br/>
had happened. Having done so she said, ‘I vowed to Allah that I would <br/>
slaughter her if Allah let me escape on her.’ The apostle smiled and said: <br/>
‘You would repay her badly when God mounted you on her and delivered <br/>
you by her and then you would slaughter her! No vow in disobedience to <br/>
God nor concerning property that is not your own is valid. She is one of <br/>
my camels, so go back to your family with God’s blessing.’ This story of <br/>
723 the Ghifari’s wife comes from Abu’l-Zubayr al-Makkl from al-Hasan b. <br/>
Abu’l-Hasan al-Basri. </p>
<p>Among the verse composed about Dhu Qarad is the following from <br/>
Hassan b. Thabit: </p>
<p>Were it not for what our horses suffered and what hurt their frogs <br/>
As they were led to the south of Saya last night, </p>
<p>They would have met you as they carried well-armed warriors <br/>
Noble in ancestry protecting their standard, </p>
<p>And the bastards would have rejoiced that we <br/>
Did not fight when Miqdad’s horsemen came. </p>
<p>We were eight; they were a great force </p>
<p>Loud-voiced yet pricked by (our) lances (and) scattered. </p>
<p>We were of the people who followed them <br/>
And we gave free rein to every noble steed. </p>
<p>Yea, by the Lord of the camels that go to Mina <br/>
Traversing the great mountain passes (we will pursue you) </p>
<p>Till we make the horses stale 2 in the midst of your dwellings <br/>
And come back with your women and children, </p>
<p>Walking gently with every swift horse and mare </p>
<p>1 V.J. </p>
<p>Heading nubtla with C. and Dtwdn cxxxvii. </p>
<p>489 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>That turns swiftly in every battle. </p>
<p>A day in which they are led and a day of charges </p>
<p>Has worn out their quarters and altered the appearance of their backs. <br/>
Uur horses are fed on milk <br/>
While war is kindled by passing winds. </p>
<p>Our sharp swords glittering cut through <br/>
Iron shields and pugnacious heads. </p>
<p>Allah put obstacles in their way to protect His sacred property <br/>
And to protect His dignity. 1 1 </p>
<p>They lived happily in their home, but </p>
<p>On the days of Dhu Qarad they were given the faces of slaves (735). <br/>
Hassan also said: </p>
<p>724 </p>
<p>Did ‘Uyayna think when he visited it 2 <br/>
That he would destroy its castles ? </p>
<p>In what you said you were made a liar. </p>
<p>You said, ‘We will take great spoil.’ </p>
<p>^ ou loathed Medina when you visited it <br/>
And met roaring lions there. </p>
<p>Back they turned running-fast like ostriches <br/>
Without getting near a single camel. </p>
<p>God’s apostle was our amir, </p>
<p>What a beloved amir to us! </p>
<p>An apostle whose message we believe <br/>
Who recites a luminous light-bringing book. </p>
<p>Ka'b b. Malik said concerning the day of Dhu Qarad with reference to <br/>
the horsemen: </p>
<p>Do the bastards think that we </p>
<p>Are not their equals in horsemanship ? </p>
<p>We are men who think killing no shame, </p>
<p>We turn not from the piercing lances. </p>
<p>We feed the guest with choicest camels’ meat <br/>
And smite the heads of the haughty. </p>
<p>We turn back the conspicuous warriors in their pride <br/>
With blows that quash the zeal of the unyielding. </p>
<p>With heroes who protect their standard, </p>
<p>Noble, generous, fierce as jungle wolves. </p>
<p>They preserve their honour and their goods </p>
<p>With swords that smash the heads beneath the helms. </p>
<p>Ask the Banu Badr if you meet them <br/>
What the brethren did on the day of battle. </p>

With rage in his heart which he could not work off ( 73 ^)* </p>
<p>Shaddad b. 'Arid said concerning the day of Dhu Qarad with reference <br/>
to 'Uyayna who was surnamed Abu Malik: </p>
<p>Why, O Abu Malik, did you not return to the fight <br/>
When your cavalry were in flight and being slain ? </p>
<p>725 You mentioned going back to 'Asjar. 2 <br/>
Nonsense! it was too late to return. </p>
<p>You trusted yourself to a spirited horse <br/>
Quickly covering the ground when given free rein. </p>
<p>When your left hand reined him in </p>
<p>He reared like a flaming cauldron. </p>
<p>And when you saw that God’s servants <br/>
Did not wait for those behind to come up <br/>
You knew that horsemen had been trained <br/>
To chase warriors when they took to the plain. </p>
<p>When they chase the cavalry they bring disgrace on them, </p>
<p>And if they are pursued they dismount </p>
<p>And protect themselves in evil case </p>
<p>With swords which the polisher has made bright. </p>
<p>THE RAID ON B. A L-M U S J A LI Q </p>
<p>The apostle stayed in Medina during the latter part of Jumada’l-Akhira <br/>
and Rajab; then he attacked B. al-Mustaliq of Khuza'a in Sha'ban a.h. 6 </p>
<p>(737). </p>
<p>'Asim b. 'Umar b. Qatada and 'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr and Muhammad <br/>
b. Yahya b. Habban each told me a part of the following story: The apostle <br/>
received news that B. al-Mustaliq were gathering together against him, <br/>
their leader being al-Harith b. Abu Dirar, the father of Juwayriya d. al- <br/>
Harith (afterwards) wife of the apostle. W hen the apostle heard about <br/>
them he went out and met them at a watering place of theirs called al- <br/>
Muraysi' in the direction of Qudayd towards the shore. There was a fight <br/>
and God put the B. al-Mustaliq to flight and killed some of them and gave <br/>
the apostle their wives, children, and property as booty. A Muslim of B. </p>
<p>726 Kalb b. 'Auf b. 'Amir b. Layth b. Bakr called Hisham b. Subaba was killed <br/>
by a man of the Ansar of the family of Ubada b. al-Samit who thought he <br/>
was an enemy and killed him in error. </p>
<p>While the apostle was by this water a party came down to it. 'Umar had <br/>
a hired servant from B. Ghifar called Jahjah b. Masud who was leading <br/>
his horse. This Jahjah and Sinan b. Wabar al-Juham, an ally of B. 'Auf b. </p>
<p>1 Reading/a*rf«&lt;?u with C. against W.’s faklxivtu. 1 A place near Mecca. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 491 </p>
<p>al-Khazraj, thrust one another away from the water and fell to fighting. </p>
<p>The JuhanI called out ‘Men of al-Ansar!’ and Jahjah called out ‘Men of the <br/>
Muhajirun!’. 'Abdullah b. Ubayy b. Salul was enraged. With him was a <br/>
number of his people including Zayd b. Arqam, a young boy. He said, <br/>
‘Have they actually done this ? They dispute our priority, they outnumber <br/>
us in our own country, and nothing so fits us and the vagabonds of Quraysh <br/>
as the ancient saying “Feed a dog and it will devour you”. By Allah when <br/>
we return to Medina the stronger will drive out the weaker.’ Then he went <br/>
to his people who were there and said: ‘This is what you have done to <br/>
yourselves. You have let them occupy your country, and you have divided <br/>
your property among them. Had you but kept your property from them <br/>
they would have gone elsewhere.’ Zayd b. Arqam heard this and went and <br/>
told the apostle when he had disposed of his enemies. 'Umar, who was with <br/>
him, said, ‘Tell 'Abbad b. Bishr to go and kill him.’ The apostle answered, </p>
<p>‘But what if men should say Muhammad kills his own companions? No, <br/>
but give orders to set off.’ Now this was at a time when the apostle was not <br/>
accustomed to travel. The men duly moved off. </p>
<p>When Abdullah b. Ubayy heard that Zayd had told the apostle what he <br/>
had said he went to him and swore that he had not said what he did say. </p>
<p>He was a great man among his own people and the Ansar who were present <br/>
with the apostle said: ‘It may well be that the boy was mistaken in what <br/>
he said, and did not remember the man’s words,’ sympathizing with Ibn <br/>
Ubayy and protecting him. </p>
<p>When the apostle had begun his journey Usayd b. Hudayr met him and 727 <br/>
saluted him as a prophet, saying, ‘You are travelling at a disagreeable time, <br/>
a thing you have never done before.’ The apostle said: ‘Have you not heard <br/>
of what your friend said ? He asserted that if he returns to Medina the <br/>
stronger will drive out the weaker.’ He answered: ‘But you will drive him <br/>
out if you want to; he is the weak and you are the strong.’ He added: <br/>
‘Treat him kindly, for Allah brought you to us w'hen his people were string¬ <br/>
ing beads to make him a crown, and he thinks that you have deprived him <br/>
of a kingdom.’ </p>
<p>Then the apostle walked with the men all that day till nightfall, and <br/>
through the night until morning and during the following day until the <br/>
sun distressed them. Then he halted them, and as soon as they touched <br/>
the ground they fell asleep. He did this to distract their minds from what <br/>
'Abdullah b. Ubayy had said the day before. He continued his journey <br/>
through the Hijaz as far as w r ater a little above al-Naqi' called Baq'ah As <br/>
he travelled at night a violent wind distressed the men and they dreaded it. </p>
<p>He told them not to be afraid because the wind announced the death of <br/>
one of the greatest of the unbelievers, and w'hen they got to Medina they <br/>
found that Rifa'a b. Zayd b. al-Tabut of B. Qaynuqa', one of the most <br/>
important Jews and a secret shelterer of the disaffected, had died that day. </p>
<p>The sura came down in which God mentioned the disaffected w'ith Ibn <br/>
Ubayy and those like-minded with him. When it came down the apostle </p>
<p>492 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>took hold of Zayd b. Arqam’s ear, saying, ‘This is he who devoted his ear <br/>
to Allah.’ 1 'Abdullah, 'Abdullah b. Ubayy’s son, heard about his father’s <br/>
affair. </p>
<p>'Asim b. 'Umar b. Qatada told me that 'Abdullah came to the apostle, <br/>
saying, ‘I have heard that you want to kill 'Abdullah b. Ubayy for what you <br/>
have heard about him. If you must do it, then order me to do it and I will <br/>
728 bring you his head, for al-Khazraj know that they have no man more <br/>
dutiful to his father than I, and I am afraid that if you order someone else <br/>
to kill him my soul will not permit me to see his slayer walking among <br/>
men and I shall kill him, thus killing a believer for an unbeliever, and so I <br/>
should go to hell.’ The apostle said: ‘Nay, but let us deal kindly with him <br/>
and make much of his companionship while he is with us. After that it <br/>
happened that if any misfortune befell it was his own people who re¬ <br/>
proached and upbraided him roughly. The apostle said to Umar when he <br/>
heard of this state of things: ‘Now what do you think, Umar? Had I <br/>
killed him on the day you wanted me to kill him the leading men would <br/>
have trembled with rage. If I ordered them to kill him today they would <br/>
kill him.’ 'Umar replied, ‘I know that the apostle’s order is more blessed <br/>
than mine.* </p>
<p>Miqyas b. Subaba came from Mecca as a Muslim, so he professed, say¬ <br/>
ing, ‘I come to you as a Muslim seeking the bloodwit for my brother who <br/>
was killed in error.’ The apostle ordered that he should have the bloodwit <br/>
for his brother Hisham and he stopped a short while with the apostle. <br/>
Then he attacked his brother’s slayer and killed him and went off to Mecca <br/>
an apostate. He spoke the following lines: </p>
<p>It eased my soul that he died in the lowland, </p>
<p>The blood of his neck veins dyeing his garments. </p>
<p>Before I killed him I was beset by cares <br/>
Which prevented-me from seeking my couch. </p>
<p>I gave free vent to my vengeance <br/>
And was the first to return to the idols. </p>
<p>I avenged Fihr on him and laid his bloodwit <br/>
On the chiefs of B. al-Najjar, the lords of Fari'. z </p>
<p>He also said: </p>
<p>I fetched him a stroke in vengeance <br/>
Which drew blood that ebbed and flowed. </p>
<p>I said as the wrinkles of death covered him </p>
<p>‘You can’t be safe from B. Bakr when they are wronged’ (738). </p>
<p>729 Of B. Mustaliq who were slain that day 'All killed two—Malik and his <br/>
son. 'Abdu’I-Rahman b. 'Auf killed one of their horsemen called Ahmar </p>
<p>1 This anecdote is related by Zayd in the first person in WaqidI (B.M. MS. 1617, 95 a )- <br/>
It is a good example of the way in which early traditions preserved the general sense and <br/>
were comparatively indifferent to the form of words. One of their castles. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 493 </p>
<p>or Uhaymir. The apostle took many captives and they were distributed <br/>
among the Muslims. One of those taken was Juwayriya d. al-Harith b. </p>
<p>Abu Dirar, the apostle’s wife. </p>
<p>Muhammad b. Ja'far b. al-Zubayr from 'Urwa b. al-Zubayr from 'A’isha <br/>
said: When the apostle distributed the captives of B. al-Mustaliq, Juway¬ <br/>
riya fell to the lot of Thabit b. Qays b. al-Shammas, or to a cousin of his, <br/>
and she gave him a deed for her redemption. She was a most beautiful <br/>
woman. She captivated every man who saw her. She came to the apostle <br/>
to ask his help in the matter. As soon as I saw' her at the door of my room <br/>
I took a dislike to her, for I knew that he would see her as I saw her. She <br/>
went in and told him w r ho she w'as—d. of al-Harith b. Abu Dirar, the chief <br/>
of his people. ‘You can see the state to W'hich I have been brought. I have <br/>
fallen to the lot of Thabit or his cousin and have given him a deed for my <br/>
ransom and have come to ask your help in the matter.’ He said, ‘Would you <br/>
like something better than that ? I will discharge your debt and marry <br/>
you,’ and she accepted him. </p>
<p>The news that the apostle had married Juwayriya was blazed abroad <br/>
and now that B. Mustaliq were the prophet’s relations by marriage the <br/>
men released those they held. When he married her a hundred families <br/>
were released. I do not know a woman who was a greater blessing to her <br/>
people than she (739). </p>
<p>Yazld b. Ruman told me that the apostle sent al-Walid b. 'Uqba b. 730 <br/>
Abu Mu'ayt to them after they had accepted Islam. When they heard of <br/>
him they rode out to meet him, but when he heard of them he was afraid <br/>
and went back to the apostle and told him that the people had determined <br/>
to kill him and had withheld their due poor tax. The Muslims talked a lot <br/>
about raiding them until the apostle himself meditated doing so. While <br/>
this was going on an embassy of theirs came to the apostle, saying: ‘We <br/>
heard about your messenger w r hen you sent him to us and we went out to <br/>
meet him to show him respect and to pay the poor tax that was due, and <br/>
he went back as fast as he could. Now we hear that he has alleged that we <br/>
went out to kill him. By Allah we did not go out with such intent.’ So <br/>
God sent down concerning him and them: ‘O you who believe if an evil 73 1 </p>
<p>man comes to you with a report examine it closely lest you do ill to a people <br/>
in ignorance and be sorry for what you have done. Know that the apostle <br/>
of God is among you. If he were to obey you in much of the government <br/>
you would be in trouble.’ 1 </p>
<p>THE LIE THAT WAS UTTERED ON THE RAID OF B. AL-MUSJALIQ </p>
<p>According to what a man I do not suspect told me from al-Zuhrl from <br/>
*Urwa from 'A’isha the apostle had gone forward on that journey of his <br/>
until he was near Medina, 'A’isha having been with him on the journey, <br/>
when the liars spoke about her. </p>
<p>1 Sura 49. 6 - </p>
<p>494 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Al-Zuhri told us from 'Alqama b. Waqqas, and from Sa'Id b. Jubayr <br/>
and from 'Urwa b. al-Zubayr, and from Ubaydullah b. Abdullah b. 'Utba, <br/>
each contributing a part of the story, one remembering more of it than <br/>
another, and I (Zuhri) have put together for you what the people told me. </p>
<p>Yahya b. 'Abbad b. Abdullah b. al-Zubayr told me from his father from <br/>
'A’isha; and Abdullah b. Abu Bakr from 'Amra d. 'Abdu’l-Rahman from <br/>
'A’isha from her own words when the liars said what they did. The whole <br/>
of her story rests on these men as a whole. One relates what another does <br/>
not. All of them are trustworthy witnesses, and all of them related wdiat <br/>
they heard from her. She said: ‘When the apostle intended to go on an <br/>
expedition he cast lots between his wives which of them should accompany <br/>
him. He did this on the occasion of the raid on B. al-Mustaliq and the lot <br/>
fell on me, so the apostle took me out. The wives on these occasions used <br/>
to eat light rations; meat did not fill them up so that they w 7 ere heavy. <br/>
When the camel was being saddled for me I used to sit in my howdah; <br/>
then the men who saddled it for me would come and pick me up and take <br/>
hold of the lower part of the how'dah and lift it up and put it on the camel’s <br/>
back and fasten it with a rope. Then they would take hold of the camel’s <br/>
head and walk with it. </p>
<p>‘When the apostle finished his journey on this occasion he started back <br/>
and halted when he was near Medina and passed a part of the night there. </p>
<p>732 Then he gave permission to start and the men moved off. I went out for a <br/>
certain purpose having a string of Zafar beads on my neck. When I had <br/>
finished, it slipped from my neck without my knowledge, and when I <br/>
returned to the camel I went feeling my neck for it but could not find it. <br/>
Meanwhile the main body had already moved off. I went back to the <br/>
place where I had been and looked for the necklace until I found it. The <br/>
men who were saddling the camel for me came up to the place I had just <br/>
left and having finished the saddling they took hold of the howdah thinking <br/>
that I was in it as I normally was, picked it up and bound it on the camel, <br/>
not doubting that I was in it. Then they took the camel by the head and <br/>
went off with it. I returned to the place and there was not a soul there. <br/>
The men had gone. So I wrapped myself in my smock and then lay down <br/>
where I was, knowing that if I were missed they would come back for me, <br/>
and by Allah I had but just lain down when Safwan b. al-Mu'attal al- <br/>
Sulaml passed me; he had fallen behind the main body for some purpose <br/>
and had not spent the night with the troops. He saw my form and came <br/>
and stood over me. He used to see me before the veil was prescribed for us, <br/>
so when he saw me he exclaimed in astonishment “The apostle’s wdfe” 1 <br/>
while I was wrapped in my garments. He asked me what had kept me <br/>
behind but I did not speak to him. Then he brought up his camel and <br/>
told me to ride it while he kept behind. So I rode it and he took the camel’s <br/>
head going forward quickly in search of the army, and by Allah we did not <br/>
overtake them and I was not missed until the morning. The men had </p>
<p>1 za'ina, a woman carried in a howdah. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 495 </p>
<p>halted and when they were rested up came the man leading me and the <br/>
liars spread their reports and the army was much disturbed. But by <br/>
Allah I knew nothing about it. </p>
<p>‘Then we came to Medina and immediately I became very ill and so <br/>
heard nothing of the matter. The story had reached the apostle and my <br/>
parents, yet they told me nothing of it though 1 missed the apostle’s accus¬ <br/>
tomed kindness to me. When I was ill he used to show compassion and <br/>
kindness to me, but in this illness he did not and I missed his attentions. </p>
<p>When he came in to see me when my mother was nursing me {740), all he 733 <br/>
said was, “How 7 is she?” 1 so that 1 was pained and asked him to let me be <br/>
taken to my mother so that she could nurse me. “Do what you like,” he <br/>
said, and so I was taken to my mother, knowing nothing of what had hap¬ <br/>
pened until I recovered from my illness some twenty days later. Now we <br/>
W'ere an Arab people: w'e did not have those privies which foreigners have <br/>
in their houses; we loathe and detest them. Our practice was to go out into <br/>
the open spaces of Medina. The women used to go out every night, and <br/>
one night I went out with Umm Mistah d. Abu Ruhm b. al-Muttalib b. </p>
<p>\Abdu Manaf. Her mother w 7 as d. Sakhr b. 'Amir b. Ka'b b. Sa'd b. Taym <br/>
aunt of Abu Bakr. As she W'as walking with me she stuihbled over her <br/>
gown and exclaimed, “May Mistah stumble,” Mistah being the nickname <br/>
of 'Auf. I said, “That is a bad thing to say about one of the emigrants who <br/>
fought at Badr.” She replied, “Haven’t you heard the news, O daughter <br/>
of Abu Bakr?” and when I said that I had not heard she went on to tell me <br/>
of what the liars had said, and when I showed my astonishment she told <br/>
me that all this really had happened. By Allah, I w r as unabie to do what I <br/>
had to do and went back. I could not stop crying until I thought that the <br/>
weeping would burst my liver. I said to my mother, “God forgive you! </p>
<p>Men have spoken ill of me (T. and you have known of it) and have not told T- 1521 <br/>
me a thing about it.” She replied “My little daughter, don’t let the matter <br/>
weigh on you. Seldom is there a beautiful woman married to a man w’ho <br/>
loves her but her rival wives gossip about her and men do the same.” </p>
<p>‘The apostle had got up and addressed the men, though I knew 7 nothing <br/>
about it. After praising God he said: “What do certain men mean by worry¬ <br/>
ing me about my family and saying false things about them ? By Allah, I <br/>
know only good of them, and they say these things of a man of whom I 734 <br/>
know naught but good, w r ho never enters a house of mine but in my <br/>
company.” </p>
<p>‘The greatest offenders were 'Abdullah b. Ubayy among the Khazraj <br/>
and Mistah and Hamna d. jahsh, for the reason that her sister Zaynab d. </p>
<p>Jahsh was one of the apostle’s wives and only she could rival me in his <br/>
favour. As for Zaynab, Allah protected her by her religion and she spoke <br/>
nothing but good. But Hamna spread the report far and wide opposing me <br/>
(T. rivalling me) for the sake of her sister, and I suffered 2 much from that. </p>
<p>1 The form used indicates the plural and, to some extent, the speaker’s indifference. </p>
<p>2 Or 'she (Zaynab) suffered'. </p>
<p>496 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>‘When the apostle made this speech Usayd b. Hudayr said: “If they are <br/>
of Aus let us rid you of them; and if they are of the Khazraj give us your <br/>
orders, for they ought to have their heads cut off.” Sa'd b. 'Ubada got up— <br/>
before that he had been thought a pious man—and said, “By Allah, you <br/>
lie. They shall not be beheaded. You would not have said this had you <br/>
not known that they were of Khazraj. Had they been your own people you <br/>
would not have said it.” Usayd answered, “Liar yourself! You are a dis¬ <br/>
affected person arguing on behalf of the disaffected.” 1 Feeling ran so high <br/>
that there was almost fighting between these two clans of Aus and Khazraj. <br/>
The apostle left and came in to see me. He called ‘All and Usama b. Zayd <br/>
and asked their advice. Usama spoke highly of me and said “They are <br/>
your family 2 and we and you know only good of them, and this is a lie and <br/>
a falsehood. </p>
<p>‘As for 'All he said; “Women are plentiful, and you can easily change <br/>
one for another. Ask the slave girl, for she will tell you the truth.” So the <br/>
apostle called Burayra to ask her, and 'All got up and gave her a violent <br/>
beating, saying, “Tell the apostle the truth,” to which she replied, “I know <br/>
only good of her. The only fault I have to find with 'A’isha is that when I <br/>
am kneading dough and tell her to watch it she neglects it and falls asleep <br/>
735 and the sheep (T. ‘pet lamb’) comes and eats it!” </p>
<p>‘Then the apostle came in to me. My parents and a woman of the <br/>
Ansar were with me and both of us were weeping. He sat down and after <br/>
praising God he said, “'A’isha, you know what people say about you. Fear <br/>
God and if you have done wrong as men say then repent towards God, for <br/>
He accepts repentance from His slaves.” As he said this my tears ceased <br/>
and I could not feel them. I waited for my parents to answer the apostle <br/>
but they said nothing. By Allah I thought myself too insignificant for God <br/>
to send down concerning me a Quran which could be read in the mosques <br/>
and used in prayer, but I was hoping that the apostle would see something <br/>
in a dream by which God would clear away the lie from me, because He <br/>
knew my innocence, or that there would be some communication. As for <br/>
a Quran coming down about me by Allah I thought far too little of myself <br/>
for that. When I saw that my parents would not speak I asked them why, <br/>
and they replied that they did not know r what to answer, and by Allah I do <br/>
not know a household which suffered as did the family of Abu Bakr in <br/>
those days. When they remained silent my weeping broke out afresh and <br/>
then I said: “Never will I repent towards God of what you mention. By <br/>
Allah, I know' that if I were to confess what men say of me, God knowing <br/>
that I am innocent of it, I should admit what did not happen; and if I <br/>
denied what they said you would not believe me.” Then I racked my <br/>
brains for the name of Jacob and could not remember it, so I said, “I will <br/>
say what the father of Joseph said: ‘My duty is to show becoming patience <br/>
and God’s aid is to be asked against what you describe.’ ” 3 </p>
<p>1 Cf. Sura 4. 107. </p>
<p>2 Care is taken to avoid the use of 'A’isha’s name. 3 Sura 12. 18. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 497 </p>
<p>And, by God, the apostle had not moved from where he was sitting when <br/>
there came over him from God what used to come over him and he was wrapped <br/>
in his garment and a leather cushion was put under his head. As for me, when <br/>
I saw this I felt no fear or alarm, for I knew that I was innocent and that God <br/>
would not treat me unjustly. As for my parents, as soon as the apostle re- 736 <br/>
covered I thought that they would die from fear that confirmation would come <br/>
from God of what men had said. Then the apostle recovered and sat up and <br/>
there fell from him as it were drops of water on a winter day, and he began <br/>
to wipe the sweat from his brow, saying, “Good news, 'A’isha! God has <br/>
sent down (word) about your innocence.” I said, “Praise be to God,” and <br/>
he went out to the men and addressed them and recited to them what God <br/>
had sent down concerning that (T. “me”). Then he gave orders about <br/>
Mistah b. Uthatha and Hassan b. Thabit and Hamna d. Jahsh who were <br/>
the most explicit in their slander and they were flogged with the prescribed <br/>
number of stripes. 1 </p>
<p>‘My father Ishaq b. Yasar told me from some of the men of B. al-Najjar <br/>
that the wife of Abu Ayyub Khalid b. Zayd said to him, “Have you heard <br/>
what people are saying about 'A’isha?” “Certainly, but it is a lie,” he said. <br/>
“Would you do such a thing?” 2 She answered “No, by Allah, I would <br/>
not.” He said, “Well, 'A’isha is a better woman than you.’” </p>
<p>'A’isha continued: When the Quran came down with the mention of <br/>
those of the slanderers who repeated what the liars had said, God said: <br/>
‘Those who bring the lie are a band among you. Do not regard it as a bad <br/>
thing for you; nay it is good for you. Every man of them will get what he <br/>
has earned from the sin, and he who had the greater share therein will have <br/>
a painful punishment,’ 3 meaning Hassan b. Thabit and his companions <br/>
who said what they said (741). </p>
<p>Then God said, ‘Why did not the believing men and women when you <br/>
heard it think good of themselves?’ i.e. say what Abu Ayyub and his wife <br/>
said. Then He said, ‘When you welcomed it w'ith your tongues and spoke <br/>
with your mouths that of which you had no knowledge you thought it a <br/>
light thing, yet with God it is grave.’ </p>
<p>When this came down about 'A’isha and about those who spoke about <br/>
her, Abu Bakr who used to make an allowance to Mistah because he was of <br/>
his kin and needy said, ‘Never will I give anything to Mistah again, nor <br/>
will I ever help him in any way after what he said about 'A’isha and brought <br/>
evil on us.’ She continued: ‘So God sent down concerning that “And let 737 <br/>
not those who possess dignity and ease among you swear not to give to <br/>
kinsmen and the poor and those who emigrate for God’s sake. Let them <br/>
forgive and show forbearance. Do you not wish that God should forgive <br/>
you? And God is forgiving, merciful”’ (742). </p>
<p>Abu Bakr said, ‘Yes, by Allah, I want God to forgive me,’ so he con¬ <br/>
tinued the allowance that he was accustomed to give to Mistah, saying, ‘I <br/>
will never withdraw it from him.’ </p>

<p>738 Then Safwan b. al-Mu'attal met Hassan b. Thabit with a sword when <br/>
he heard what he was saying about him, for Hassan had also uttered some <br/>
verse alluding to him and the Arabs of Mudar who had accepted Islam: </p>
<p>The vagabond immigrants have become powerful and numerous <br/>
And Ibnu’l-Furay'a has become solitary in the land. 1 <br/>
As good as bereaved is the mother of the man I fight <br/>
Or caught in the claws of a lion. </p>
<p>The man I kill will not be paid for <br/>
By money or by blood. </p>
<p>When the wind blows in the north and the sea rides high <br/>
And bespatters the shore with foam <br/>
’Tis no more violent than I when you see me in a rage <br/>
Devastating as a cloud of hail. </p>
<p>As for Quraysh, I will never make peace with them </p>
<p>Until they leave error for righteousness </p>
<p>And abandon al-Lat and al-'Uzza </p>
<p>And all bow down to the One, The Eternal, </p>
<p>And testify that what the apostle said to them is true, </p>
<p>And faithfully fulfil the solemn oath w r ith God. 2 </p>
<p>Safwan met him and smote him with his sw'ord, saying according to what <br/>
Ya'qub b. 'Utba told me: </p>
<p>Here’s the edge of my sw'ord for you! </p>
<p>When you lampoon a man like me you don’t get a poem in return! </p>
<p>Muhammad b. Ibrahim b. al-Harith al-Tayml told me that Thabit b. <br/>
Qays b. al-Shammas leapt upon Safw r an when he smote Hassan and tied <br/>
his hands to his neck and took him to the quarter of B. al-Harith b. al- <br/>
Khazraj. Abdullah b. Rawaha met him and asked what had happened, and <br/>
he said: ‘Do I surprise you? He smote Hassan with the sword and by <br/>
Allah he must have killed him.’ Abdullah asked if the apostle knew about <br/>
what he had done, and when he said that he did not he told him that he <br/>
had been very ddring and that he must free the man. He did so. Then <br/>
they came to the apostle and told him of the affair and he summoned <br/>
Hassan and Safwan. The latter said, ‘He insulted and satirized me and <br/>
739 rage so overcame me that I smote him.’ The apostle said to Hassan, ‘Do <br/>
you look with an evil eye on my people because God has guiddd them to <br/>
Islam?’ He added, ‘Be charitable about what has befallen you.’ Hassan <br/>
said, ‘It is yours, O apostle’ (743). </p>
<p>The same informant told me that the apostle gave him in compensation <br/>
Blr Ha, today the castle of B. Hudayla in Medina. It w'as a property <br/>
belonging to Abu Talha b. Sahl which he had given as alms to the apostle </p>
<p>1 Here in a bad sense. He is speaking of himself submerged in a sea of refugees, </p>
<p>2 The language is reminiscent of the Quran. The point of the reference to §afwan is not <br/>
clear to me. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 499 </p>
<p>who S ave t0 Hassan for his blow'. He also gave him Sirin a Copt slave- <br/>
girl, and she bare him 'Abdu’l-Rahman. </p>
<p>'A’isha used to say, ‘Questions were asked about Ibnu’l-Mu'attal and <br/>
they found that he was impotent; he never touched women. He w r as killed <br/>
as a martyr after this.’ </p>
<p>Hassan b. Thabit said, excusing himself for what he had said about <br/>
'A’isha: </p>
<p>Chaste, keeping to her house, above suspicion, </p>
<p>Never thinking of reviling innocent women; </p>
<p>A noble woman of the clan of Lu’ayy b. Ghalib, </p>
<p>Seekers of honour whose glory passes not away. </p>
<p>Pure, God having purified her nature <br/>
And cleansed her from all evil and falsehood. </p>
<p>If I said what you allege that I said <br/>
Let not my hands perform their office. </p>
<p>How could I, wdth my lifelong affection and support </p>
<p>For the family of the apostle w : ho lends splendour to all gatherings, </p>
<p>His rank so high above all others that <br/>
The highest leap w'ould fall short of it ? </p>
<p>What has been said w r ill not hold </p>
<p>But is the W'ord of one w r ho w'ould slander me (744). </p>
<p>A Muslim said about the flogging of Hassan and his companions for 740 <br/>
slandering 'A’isha (745): </p>
<p>Hassan, Hamna, and Mistah tasted w'hat they deserved <br/>
For uttering unseemly slander; </p>
<p>They slandered w'ith ill-founded accusations their prophet’s wife; </p>
<p>They angered the Lord of the glorious throne and were chastised! </p>
<p>They injured God’s apostle through her <br/>
And were made a public and lasting disgrace. </p>
<p>Lashes rained upon them like <br/>
Raindrops falling from the highest clouds. </p>
<p>THE AFFAIR O.F AL-IIUDA YB IY A, A.H. 6. THE WILLING <br/>
HOMAGE AND THE PEACE BETWEEN THE APOSTLE AND <br/>
SUHAYL B. 'AMR </p>
<p>Then the apostle stayed in Medina during the months of Ramadan and <br/>
Shawwal and went out on the little pilgrimage in Dhu’l-Qa'da with no <br/>
intention of making w'ar (746). He called together the Arabs and neigh¬ <br/>
bouring Bedoum to march with him, fearing that Quraysh would oppose <br/>
im with arms or prevent him from visiting the temple, as they actually did. </p>
<p>Many of the Arabs held back from him, and he went out with the emi¬ <br/>
grants and Ansar and such of the Arabs as stuck to him. He took the </p>
<p>500 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>sacrificial victims with him and donned the pilgrim garb so that all would <br/>
know that he did not intend war and that his purpose was to visit the <br/>
temple and to venerate it. </p>
<p>Muhammad b. Muslim b. Shihab al-Zuhrl from 'Urwa b. al-Zubayr <br/>
from Miswar b. Makhrama and Marwan b. al-Hakam told me: The <br/>
apostle went out in the year of al-Hudaybiya with peaceful intent meaning <br/>
to visit the temple, and took with him seventy camels for sacrifice. There <br/>
were seven hundred men so that each camel w r as on behalf of ten men. <br/>
Jabir b. 'Abdullah, so I have heard, used to say, ‘We, the men of al-Huday¬ <br/>
biya, were fourteen hundred.’ </p>
<p>741 Al-Zuhrl continued: When the apostle was in 'Usfan, Bishr b. Sufyan <br/>
al-Ka'bi met him (747) and said: ‘There are Quraysh who have heard of <br/>
your coming and have come out with their milch-camels and have put on <br/>
leopards’ skins, 1 and have encamped at Dhu Tuwa swearing that you will <br/>
never enter Mecca in defiance of them. This man Khalid b. al-Walid is <br/>
with their cavalry which they have sent in advance to Kura'u’l-Ghamlm.’ 2 <br/>
The apostle said: ‘Alas, Quraysh, war has devoured them! What harm <br/>
would they have suffered if they had left me and the rest of the Arabs to <br/>
go our own ways ? If they should kill me that is what they desire, and if <br/>
God should give me the victory over them they would enter Islam in flocks. <br/>
If they do not do that they will fight while they have the strength, so what <br/>
are Quraysh thinking of? By Allah, I will not cease to fight for the mission <br/>
with which God has entrusted me until He makes it victorious or I perish.’ <br/>
Then he said, ‘Who will take us out by a way in ’which we shall not meet <br/>
them ?’ </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr told me that a man of Aslam volunteered to do <br/>
so and he took them by a rugged, rocky track between passes which was <br/>
very hard on the Muslims, and when they emerged from it on to the easy <br/>
ground at the end of the wadi the apostle said to the men, ‘Say, We ask <br/>
God’s forgiveness and we repent towards Him.’ They did so and he said, <br/>
‘That is the “putting away” 3 that was enjoined on the children of Israel; <br/>
but they did not say the words.’ </p>
<p>The apostle ordered the force to turn to the right through the salty <br/>
growth 4 on the road which leads by the pass of al-Murar to the declivity of <br/>
al-Hudaybiya below Mecca. They did so, and when the Quraysh cavalry <br/>
saw from the dust of the army that they had turned aside from their path <br/>
they returned at a gallop to Quraysh. The apostle went as far as the pass <br/>
of al-Murar and when his camel knelt and the men said, ‘The camel won’t <br/>
get up,’ he said: ‘It has not refused and such is not its nature, but the One </p>
<p>1 This passage and 744, line 5, imply that leopard skins were actually worn. The language <br/>
in Hamdsa 82. 13 and Mufad. 640. 6 appears to be figurative. For ‘milch-camels’ some <br/>
substitute ‘women and children’. </p>
<p>2 A wadi about 8 miles from 'Usfan. </p>
<p>3 hiffa is said to mean ‘take away our sins’. Cf. Suras 2. 55 and 7. 161. </p>
<p>4 Hamd here may be a place-name, but the place of this name in Yaq. ii. 339 is muchtoo </p>

eturned and told the Quraysh what the apostle had said. </p>
<p>502 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Then they sent to him al-Hulays b. ‘Alqama or Ibn Zabban, who was at <br/>
that time chief of the black troops, being one of B. al-Harith b. ‘Abdu <br/>
Manat b. Kinana. When he saw him the apostle said, ‘This is one of the <br/>
devout people, so send the sacrificial animals to meet him so that he can <br/>
see them! When he saw them going past him from the side of the w ? adi with <br/>
their festive collars round their necks and how they had eaten their hair 1 <br/>
because they had been so long kept back from the place of sacrifice, he <br/>
went back to Quraysh and did not come to the apostle, so greatly was he <br/>
impressed by what he had seen. When he told them that, they said, ‘Sit <br/>
down! You are only a Bedouin, utterly ignorant.’ </p>
<p>‘Abdullah b. Abu Bakr told me that this enraged al-Hulays, w r ho said: <br/>
‘You men of Quraysh, it was not for this that we made an alliance and <br/>
agreement with you. Is a man who comes to do honour to God’s house to <br/>
be excluded from it ? By him who holds my life in his hand, either you let <br/>
Muhammad do what he has come to do or I shall take aw r ay the black troops <br/>
to the last man.’ They said, ‘Be quiet, Hulays! until we obtain for ourselves <br/>
acceptable terms.’ </p>
<p>In his narrative al-Zuhrl said: Then they sent ‘Urwa b. Mas'ud al- <br/>
Thaqafi to the apostle and he said: ‘You men of Quraysh, I have seen the <br/>
744 harshness and rude words wfith which you have received those you sent to <br/>
Muhammad when they returned to you. You know' that you are the father <br/>
and I am the son—for ‘Urwa w r as the son of Subay'a d. ‘Abdu Shams—I <br/>
heard of what befell you and I collected those of my people who obeyed <br/>
me; then I came to you to help you.’ They agreed and said that they <br/>
did not suspect him. So he came to the apostle and sat before him and said: <br/>
‘Muhammad, have you collected a mixed people together and then brought <br/>
them to your own people to destroy them ? Quraysh have come out with <br/>
their milch-camels 2 clad in leopard skins swearing that you shall never <br/>
enter Mecca by force. By God I think I see you deserted by these people <br/>
(here) tomorrow.* Now Abu Bakr was sitting behind the apostle and he <br/>
said, ‘Suck al-Lat’s nipples! Should we desert him?’ He asked who had <br/>
spoken, and when he heard it was Ibn Abu Quhafa he said, ‘By Allah, did <br/>
I not owe you a favour I would pay you back for that, but now we are <br/>
quits.’ Then he began to take hold of the apostle’s beard as he talked to <br/>
him. Al-Mughira b. Shu'ba w r as standing by the apostle’s head clad in <br/>
mail and he began to hit his hand as he held the apostle’s beard saying, <br/>
‘Take your hand away from the apostle’s face before you lose it.’ 'Urwa <br/>
said, ‘Confound you, how rough and rude you are!’ The apostle smiled <br/>
and when 'Urwa asked who the man was he told him that it was his <br/>
brother’s son, al-Mughira b. Shu’ba and he said, ‘O wretch, it was only <br/>
yesterday that I washed your dirty parts!’ (750). </p>
<p>The apostle told him w'hat he had told the others, namely that he had <br/>
not come out for war. He got up from the apostle’s presence having seen </p>
<p>1 It is just possible that anbar is the pi. of ivibdr, a bitter salty herb with thorns (hamitfa). <br/>
In that case it would support the rendering of Ham^ on p. 741. z v.s. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 503 </p>
<p>how his companions treated him. Whenever he performed his ablutions <br/>
they ran to get the water he had used; if he spat they ran to it; if a hair of 745 <br/>
his head fell they ran to pick it up. So he returned to Quraysh and said, </p>
<p>‘I have been to Chosroes in his kingdom, and Caesar in his kingdom and <br/>
the Negus in his kingdom, but never have I seen a king among a people <br/>
like Muhammad among his companions. I have seen a people who will <br/>
never abandon him for any reason, so form your own opinion.’ </p>
<p>A traditionist told me that the apostle called Khirash b. Umayya al- <br/>
Khuza I and sent him to Quraysh in Mecca, mounting him on one of his <br/>
camels called al-Tha'lab to tell their chiefs from him what he had come <br/>
for. They hamstrung the apostle’s camel and wanted to kill the man, but <br/>
the black troops protected him and let him go his way so that he came <br/>
back to the apostle. </p>
<p>One whom I do not suspect from 'Ikrima client of Ibn ‘Abbas from the <br/>
latter told me that Quraysh had sent forty or fifty men with ©rders to <br/>
surround the apostle s camp and get hold of one of his companions for <br/>
them, but they W'ere caught and brought to the apostle, who forgave them <br/>
and let them go their way. They had attacked the camp with stones and <br/>
arrows. Then he called 'Umar to send him to Mecca with the same mes¬ <br/>
sage, but ‘Umar told him that he feared for his life with Quraysh, because <br/>
there were none of B. 'Adiy b. Ka'b in Mecca to protect him, and Quraysh <br/>
knew of his enmity and his rough treatment of them. He recommended <br/>
that a man more prized there than himself should be sent, namely 'Uthman. </p>
<p>The apostle summoned ‘Uthman and sent him to Abu Sufyan and the <br/>
chiefs of Quraysh to tell them that he had not come for war but merely to <br/>
visit the house and to venerate its sanctity. </p>
<p>As 'Uthman entered or was about to enter Mecca Aban b. Sa'Id b. al- <br/>
‘As met him and carried him in front of him. Then he gave him his protec¬ <br/>
tion until he could convey the apostle’s message to them. Having heard <br/>
what ‘Uthman had to say, they said: ‘If you want to go round the temple, 746 <br/>
go round it.’ He said that he could not do so until Muhammad did so, and <br/>
Quraysh kept him a prisoner with them. The apostle and the Muslims <br/>
were informed that 'Uthman had been killed. </p>
<p>THE WILLING HOMAGE </p>
<p>Abdullah b. Abu Bakr told me that when the apostle heard that 'Uthman <br/>
had been killed he said that they would not leave until they fought the <br/>
enemy, and he summoned the men to give their undertaking. The pledge <br/>
of al-Ridwan took place under a tree. Men used to say that the apostle took <br/>
their pledge unto death. Jabir b. 'Abdullah used to say that the apostle did <br/>
not take their pledge unto death, but rather their undertaking that they <br/>
w r ould not run away. Not one of the Muslims who were present failed to <br/>
give his hand except al-Jadd b- Qays, brother of B. Salima. Jabir used to <br/>
say: ‘By Allah, I can almost see him now sticking to his camel’s side </p>
<p>504 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>cringing as he tried to hide himself from the men.’ Then the apostle heard <br/>
that the news about 'Uthman was false (751). </p>
<p>THE ARMISTICE </p>
<p>Al-Zuhrl said: Then Quraysh sent Suhayl b, 'Amr brother of B. 'Amir b. <br/>
Lu’ayy to the apostle with instructions to make peace with him on condi¬ <br/>
tion that he went back this year, so that none of the Arabs could say that <br/>
he made a forcible entry. When the apostle saw him coming he said, ‘The </p>
<p>747 People want to make peace seeing that they have sent this man.’ After a <br/>
long discussion peace w^as made and nothing remained but to write an <br/>
agreement. 'Umar jumped up and went to Abu Bakr saying, ‘Is he not <br/>
God’s apostle, and are we not Muslims, and are they not polytheists?’ to <br/>
which Abu Bakr agreed, and he went on: ‘Then why should we agree to <br/>
what is demeaning to our religion ?’ He replied, ‘Stick to what he says, for <br/>
I testify that he is God’s apostle.’ 'Umar said, ‘And so do I.’ Then he went <br/>
to the apostle and put the same questions to which the apostle answered, <br/>
‘I am God’s slave and His apostle. I will not go against His commandment <br/>
and He will not make me the loser.’ 'Umar used to say, T have not ceased <br/>
giving alms and fasting and praying and freeing slaves because of what I <br/>
did that day out of fear for what I had said, when I hoped that (my plan) <br/>
would be better.’ </p>
<p>Then the apostle summoned 'All and told him to write ‘In the name of <br/>
Allah the Compassionate, the Merciful.’ Suhayl said ‘I do not recognize <br/>
this; but write “In thy name, O Allah.’” The apostle told him to write <br/>
the latter and he did so. Then he said: ‘Write “This is what Muhammad, <br/>
the apostle of God has agreed with Suhayl b. ‘Amr.’” Suhayl said, ‘If I <br/>
witnessed that you were God’s apostle I would not have fought you. Write <br/>
your own name and the name of your father.’ The apostle said: ‘Write <br/>
“This is what Muhammad b. 'Abdullah has agreed with Suhayl b. 'Amr: <br/>
they have agreed to lay aside war for ten years during which men can be <br/>
safe and refrain from hostilities on condition that if anyone comes to <br/>
Muhammad without the permission of his guardian he will return him to <br/>
them; and if anyone of those with Muhammad comes to Quraysh they will <br/>
not return him to him. We will not show enmity one to another and there <br/>
shall be no secret reservation or bad faith. He who wishes to enter into a <br/>
bond and agreement with Muhammad may do so and he who wishes to <br/>
enter into a bond and agreement with Quraysh may do so.’” Here <br/>
Khuza'a leapt up and said, ‘We are in a bond and agreement with </p>
<p>748 Muhammad,’ and B. Bakr leapt up and said the same with regard to <br/>
Quraysh, adding ‘You must retire from us this year and not enter Mecca <br/>
against our will, and next year w^e will make way for you and you can <br/>
enter it with your companions, and stay there three nights. You may <br/>
carry a rider’s weapons, the sw r ords in their sheaths. You can bring in <br/>
nothing more.’ </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 505 </p>
<p>While the apostle and Suhayl were writing the document, suddenly Abu <br/>
Jandal b. Suhayl appeared walking in fetters, having escaped to the apostle. <br/>
The apostle’s companions had gone out without any doubt of occupying <br/>
Mecca because of the vision which the apostle had seen, and when they saw <br/>
the negotiations for peace and a withdrawal going on and what the apostle <br/>
had taken on himself they felt depressed almost to the point of death. <br/>
When Suhayl saw Abu Jandal he got up and hit him in the face and took <br/>
hold of his collar, saying, ‘Muhammad, the agreement between us was <br/>
concluded before this man came to you.’ He replied, ‘You are right.’ He <br/>
began to pull him roughly by his collar and to drag him away to return <br/>
him to Quraysh, while Abu Jandal shrieked at the top of his voice, ‘Am I to <br/>
be returned to the polytheists that they may entice me from my religion O <br/>
Muslims?’ and that increased the people’s dejection. The apostle said, </p>
<p>‘O Abu Jandal, be patient and control yourself, for God will provide relief <br/>
and a means of escape for you and those of you who are helpless. W£ have <br/>
made peace with them and we and they have invoked God in our agree¬ <br/>
ment and we cannot deal falsely with them.’ 'Umar jumped up and walked <br/>
alongside Abu Jandal saying, ‘Be patient for they are only polytheists; the <br/>
blood of one of them is but the blood of a dog,’ and he brought the hilt of <br/>
his sword close up to him. 'Umar used to say, ‘I hoped that he would take <br/>
the sword and kill his father with it, but the man spared his father and so <br/>
the matter ended.’ </p>
<p>When the apostle had finished the document he summoned representa¬ <br/>
tives of the Muslims and polytheists to witness to the peace, namely Abu <br/>
Bakr, 'Umar, and 'Abdu’l-Rahman b. 'Auf, 'Abdullah b. Suhayl b. 'Amr, 749 <br/>
and Sa'd b. Abu Waqqas, Mahmud b. Maslama, Mikraz b. Hafs who was <br/>
a polytheist at the time, and 'All who was the writer of the document. </p>
<p>The apostle was encamped in the profane country, and he used to pray <br/>
in the sacred area. When the peace was concluded he slaughtered his vic¬ <br/>
tims and sat down and shaved his head. I have heard that it was Khirash b. <br/>
Umayya b. al-Fadl al-Khuza'i who shaved him then. When the men saw <br/>
what the apostle had done they leapt up and did the same. </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. Abu Najlh from Mujahid from Ibn 'Abbas told me, ‘Some <br/>
men shaved their heads on the day of al-Hudaybiya while others cut their <br/>
hair.’ The apostle said,‘May God have mercy on the shavers.’ They said, </p>
<p>‘The cutters, too, O apostle?’ Three times they had to put this question <br/>
until finally he added ‘and the cutters’. When they asked him why he had <br/>
repeatedly confined the invocation of God’s mercy to the shavers he <br/>
replied, ‘Because they did not doubt.’ </p>
<p>The same authorities told me that the apostle sacrificed in the year of <br/>
al-Hudaybiya among his victims a camel belonging to Abu Jahl which had <br/>
a silver nose-ring, thus enraging the polytheists. </p>
<p>Zuhrl continued: The apostle then went on his way back and when he <br/>
was half-way back the stir a al-Fath came down: ‘We have given you a <br/>
plain victory that God may forgive you your past sin and the sin which is </p>
<p>506 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>to come and may complete his favour upon you and guide you on an <br/>
upright path.’ 1 Then the account goes on about him and his companions <br/>
until he comes to mention the oath of allegiance and He said: ‘Those who <br/>
swear allegiance to you really swear allegiance to God, the hand of God <br/>
being above their hands; so he who breaks his oath breaks it to his own <br/>
hurt; while he who is faithful to what he has covenanted with God, to him <br/>
will He give a great reward.’ </p>
<p>Then He mentioned the Bedouin who held back from him. Then He <br/>
said when he urged them to take the field with him and they procrastinated, <br/>
‘The Bedouin who were left behind will say to you: Our possessions and <br/>
750 our families preoccupied us!’ Then follows an account of them until the <br/>
words ‘Those who were left behind will say when you go out to capture <br/>
spoil, Let us follow you, wishing to change what God has said. Say, You <br/>
shall not follow us. Thus has God said beforehand.’ Then follows an <br/>
account of them and how it was explained to them that they must fight <br/>
a people of great prowess. </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. Abu Najlh from 'Ata’ b. Abu Rabah from Ibn 'Abbas said <br/>
(That means) Persia. One whom I do not suspect from al-Zuhrl told me <br/>
that ‘a people of great prow r ess’ meant Hanifa with the arch-liar. </p>
<p>Then He said: ‘God was pleased with the believers when they swore <br/>
allegiance to you under the tree and He knew what was in their hearts, <br/>
and He sent down the Saktna 2 upon them and rewarded them with a recent <br/>
victory and much spoil which they will take. God is mighty, wise. God <br/>
has promised you much spoil which you will capture and has given you <br/>
this in advance, and kept men’s hands from you, that it may be a sign to <br/>
the believers and that He may guide you on an upright path, and other <br/>
(things) which you have not been able to get. God encompasses them, and <br/>
God is almighty.’ </p>
<p>Then He mentioned how He had kept him away from battle after the <br/>
victory over them, meaning those He had kept from him. Then He said: <br/>
‘He it is who has kept their hands from you and your hands from them in <br/>
the vale of Mecca, after He had given you victory over them. God is a seer <br/>
of what you do.’ Then He said: ‘They are those who disbelieved and <br/>
debarred you from the sacred mosque and the offering from reaching its <br/>
goal’ (752). ‘And had it not been for the believing men and women whom <br/>
you did not know lest you should tread them under foot and thus incur <br/>
guilt for them unwittingly.’ Ma'arra means ‘a fine’, i.e. lest you should <br/>
suffer loss for them unwittingly and pay its bloodwit; as for real guilt he <br/>
did not fear it on their account (753). </p>
<p>Then he said, ‘When those who disbelieve had set in their hearts zealotry, <br/>
751 the zealotry of paganism,’ i.e. Suhayl b. 'Amr when he scorned to write ‘In <br/>
the name of Allah the Compassionate the Merciful’ and that Muhammad is <br/>
God’s apostle. Then He said ‘God sent down His sakina 2 upon His apostle </p>
<p>1 Sura 48. </p>
<p>2 This is (a) a genuine Arabic word meaning ‘tranquillity’, ‘calm’; and { b) a borrowing </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 507 </p>
<p>and the believers and imposed on them the word of piety, for they were meet <br/>
and worthy of it,’ i.e. the declaration of God’s unity, the witness that there <br/>
is no God but Allah and that Muhammad is His slave and His apostle. </p>
<p>Then He said: ‘God has fulfilled the vision to His apostle in truth. You <br/>
shall enter the sacred mosque if God will, safely with heads shaved and hair <br/>
cut short fearing not. For He knows what you do not know,’ i.e. the vision <br/>
which the apostle saw that he would enter Mecca safely without fear. He <br/>
says ‘with your heads shaved and hair cut short’ along with him without <br/>
fear, for He know r s what you do not know of that, and more than that He <br/>
has wrought a near victory, the peace of al-Hudaybiya. </p>
<p>No previous victory in Islam was greater than this. There was nothing <br/>
but battle when men met; but when there was an armistice and war w r as <br/>
abolished and men met in safety and consulted together none talked about <br/>
Islam intelligently without entering it. In those two years double as many <br/>
or more than double as many entered Islam as ever before (754). </p>
<p>THE CASE OF THOSE LEFT HELPLESS AFTER THE PEACE </p>
<p>When the apostle arrived in Medina Abii Baslr 'Utba b. Asld b. Jariya, <br/>
one of those imprisoned in Mecca, came to him. Azhar S. 'Abdu 'Auf b. <br/>
'Abd b. al-Harith b. Zuhra and al-Akhnas b. Shaffq b. 'Amr b. Wahb al- <br/>
Thaqafi wrote to the apostle about him, and they sent a man of B. 'Amir b. 752 <br/>
Lu’ayy with a freed slave of theirs. When they came to the apostle with <br/>
the letter he said, ‘You know the undertaking we gave these people and it <br/>
ill becomes us that treachery should enter our religion. God will bring <br/>
relief and a way of escape to those helpless like you, so go back to your <br/>
people.’ He said, ‘Would you return me to the polytheists who will seduce <br/>
me from my religion ?’ He said, ‘Go, for God will bring relief and a way of <br/>
escape for you and the helpless ones with you.’ So he went with them as <br/>
far as Dhu’l-Hulayfa 1 where he and the two men sat against a wall. Abu <br/>
Baslr said, ‘Is your sword sharp, O brother of B. 'Amir?’ When he said <br/>
that it was he said that he would like to look at it. ‘Look at it if you want <br/>
to,’ he replied. Abu Baslr unsheathed it and dealt him a blow that killed <br/>
him. The freedman ran off to the apostle w r ho was sitting in the mosque, <br/>
and when the apostle saw him coming he said, ‘This man has seen some¬ <br/>
thing frightful.’ When he came up the apostle said, ‘What’s the matter, <br/>
woe to you?’ He said: ‘Your man has killed my man,’ and almost at once <br/>
Abu Baslr came up girt with the sword, and standing by the apostle he <br/>
said, ‘Your obligation is over and God has removed it from you. You duly <br/>
handed me over to the men and I have protected myself in my religion lest <br/>
I should be seduced therein or scoffed at.’ The apostle said, ‘Woe is his <br/>
mother, he would have kindled a war had there been others with him .’ 2 </p>
<p>from the Hebrew shekinah, possibly through the medium of Syriac. A summary of what has <br/>
been said about it with a bibliography is given by A. Jeffery, Foreign Vocabulary of the <br/>
Quran, 174. 1 About six or seven miles from Medina. </p>
<p>2 Or, ‘The firebrand 1 Would that others had been with him!’ </p>
<p>5°8 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Then Abu Basir went off until he halted at al-'Is in the region of Dhu’l- <br/>
Marwa by the sea-shore on the road which Quraysh were accustomed to <br/>
take to Syria. The Muslims who were confined in Mecca heard what the <br/>
apostle had said of Abu Basir so they went out to join him in al-'Is. About <br/>
seventy men attached themselves to him, and they so harried Quraysh, <br/>
killing everyone they could get hold of and cutting to pieces every caravan <br/>
that passed them, that Quraysh wrote to the apostle begging him by the <br/>
753 ties of kinship to take these men in, for they had no use for them; so the <br/>
apostle took them in and they came to him in Medina (755). </p>
<p>When Suhayl heard that Abu Basir had killed his 'Amiri guard he leant <br/>
his back against the Ka'ba and swore that he would not remove it until this <br/>
man s bloodwit was paid. Abu Sufyan b. Harb said, 'By God, this is sheer <br/>
folly. It will not be paid.’ Three times he said it. </p>
<p>Mauhab b. Riyah Abu Unays, an ally of B. Zuhra, said (756): </p>
<p>A brief word from Suhayl reached me <br/>
And woke me from my sleep. </p>
<p>If you wish to reproach me </p>
<p>Then reproach me, for you are not far from me. </p>
<p>Would you threaten me when 'Abdu Manaf is round me <br/>
With Makhzum? Alas, whom are you attacking? </p>
<p>If you put me to the test you will not find me <br/>
A weak support in grave misfortunes. </p>
<p>I can rival in birth the best of my people. </p>
<p>When the weak are ill-treated I protect them. </p>
<p>They defend the heights of Mecca without doubt <br/>
As far as the valleys and the wadi sides <br/>
With every blood mare and fiery horse <br/>
Grown thin from long fighting. </p>
<p>Ma'add know they have in al-Khayf 1 <br/>
A pavilion of glory exalted high. </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. al-Ziba'ra answered him: </p>
<p>Mauhab has become like a poor donkey </p>
<p>Braying in a village as he passes through it. </p>
<p>A man like you cannot attack Suhayl. </p>
<p>Vain is your effort. Whom are you attacking? </p>
<p>Shut up, you son of a blacksmith, </p>
<p>And stop talking nonsense in the land. </p>
<p>Don’t mention the blame of Abu Yazld. </p>
<p>There’s a great difference between oceans and puddles. </p>

<p>THE WOMEN WHO EMIGRATED AFTER THE ARMISTICE 75. </p>
<p>Umm Kulthum d. 'Uqba b. Abu Mu'ayt migrated to the apostle during <br/>
this period. Her two brothers 'Umara and al-Walld sons of 'Uqba came <br/>
and asked the apostle to return her to them in accordance with the agree¬ <br/>
ment between him and Quraysh at Hudaybiya, but he would not. God <br/>
forbade it. </p>
<p>Al-Zuhrl from 'Urwa b. al-Zubayr told me: I came in to him as he was <br/>
writing a letter to Ibn Abu Hunayda, the friend of al-Walld b. Abdu’l- <br/>
Malik who had written to ask him about the word of God: ‘O you who <br/>
believe, when believing women come to you as emigrants test them. God <br/>
knows best about their faith. If you know that they are believers do not <br/>
send them back to the unbelievers. They are not lawful to them nor vice <br/>
versa. And give them (the unbelievers) what they have spent on them. It <br/>
is no sin for you to marry them when you have given them their dues, and <br/>
hold not to the ties of unbelieving women’ 1 (757). Ask for what you have <br/>
spent and let them ask for what they have spent. That is the judgement of <br/>
Allah w r ho judges between you. God is a knower, wise.’ </p>
<p>'Urwa b. al-Zubayr 2 wrote to him: The apostle made peace with Quraysh <br/>
on the day of al-Hudaybiya on condition that he should return to them <br/>
those who came without the permission of their guardians. But when <br/>
women migrated to the apostle and to Islam God refused to allow them to <br/>
be returned to the polytheists if they had been tested by the test of Islam, <br/>
and they knew that they came only out of desire for Islam, and He ordered <br/>
that their dowries should be returned to Quraysh if their women were <br/>
withheld from them if they returned to the Muslims the dowries of the <br/>
women they had withheld from them. ‘That is the judgement of God which <br/>
He judges between you, and Allah is knowing, wise.’ So the apostle with¬ <br/>
held the women and returned the men, and he asked what God ordered 755 <br/>
him to ask of the dowries of the women who were withheld from them, <br/>
and that they should return what was due if the other side did the same. </p>
<p>Had it not been for this judgement of God’s the apostle would have re¬ <br/>
turned the women as he returned the men. And had it not been for the <br/>
armistice and covenant between them on the day of al-Hudaybiya he would <br/>
have kept the women and not returned the dowries, for that is what he used <br/>
to do with the Muslim women who came to him before the covenant. </p>
<p>I asked al-Zuhrf about this passage: ‘And if any of your wives have gone <br/>
to the unbelievers and you have your turn of triumph, then give those <br/>
whose wives have gone the like of what they spent, and fear Allah in W'hom <br/>
you believe.’ He said, If one of you loses his family to the unbelievers and <br/>
a woman does not come to you you may take for her the like of what they </p>

<p>2 He was the principal authority on apostolic tradition. His father was a cousin of the <br/>
prophet, his mother Asraa’ was a daughter of Abu Bakr, and his brother was a candidate for <br/>
the caliphate, and he was closely associated with 'A’isha, who was his aunt. He was born in <br/>
a.h. 23 and died in 94. </p>

<p>take from you, then compensate them from any booty that you secure. <br/>
When this verse came down, ‘O you who believe when believing women <br/>
come to you asemigrants,’ as far as the words ‘and hold not to the cords of <br/>
disbelieving women’ it referred to 'Umar’s divorcing his wife Qurayba d. <br/>
Abu Umayya b. al-Mughira. Mu'awiya b. Abu Sufyan married her after¬ <br/>
wards while they were both polytheists in Mecca; and Umm Kulthum the <br/>
Khuza'ite woman d. Jarwal mother of Ubaydullah b. 'Umar whom Abu <br/>
Jahm b. Hudhayfa b. Ghanim a man of 'Umar’s people married while <br/>
they both were polytheists (758). </p>
<p>THE EXPEDITION TO KHAYBAR, A.H. J </p>
<p>After his return from al-Hudaybiya the apostle stayed in Medina during <br/>
Dhu’l-Hijja and part of al-Muharram, the polytheists superintending the </p>
<p>756 pilgrimage. Then he marched against Khaybar (759). </p>
<p>Muhammad b. Ibrahim b. al-Harith al-Tayml from Abu’I-Haytham b. <br/>
Nasr b. Duhr al-Aslami from his father who said that he heard the apostle <br/>
as he journeyed say to 'Amir b. al-Akwa' who was the uncle of Salama b. <br/>
'Amr b. al-Akwa' who was named Sinan: ‘Dismount, Ibn al-Akwa', and <br/>
chant one of your camel-songs for us’; so he got down and recited this rough <br/>
rhyme: </p>
<p>But for Allah we should not have been guided <br/>
Nor given alms nor prayed. </p>
<p>If people treat us unjustly </p>
<p>And if they wish to seduce us we resist. </p>
<p>Send down Saklna 1 upon us </p>
<p>And make our feet firm when we meet our enemies. </p>
<p>The apostle said, ‘May God have mercy on you!’ 'Umar said, ‘You have <br/>
made his death inevitable, O apostle of God. Would that you had let us <br/>
enjoy him longer.’ He was killed at Khaybar as a martyr. I have heard <br/>
that his sword turned upon him as he was fighting and gave him such a <br/>
grievous wound that he died of it. The Muslims were in doubt as to <br/>
whether he died a martyr, saying that he had died by his own weapon. But <br/>
his nephew Salama b. 'Amr b. al-Akwa' asked the apostle about it, telling <br/>
him what men were saying, and he said, ‘Certainly he is a martyr,’ and he <br/>
and the Muslims prayed over him. </p>
<p>One whom I do not suspect told me from ‘Ata’ b. Abu Marwan al- <br/>
Aslami from his father from Abu Mu'attib b. 'Amr that when the apostle <br/>
looked down on Khaybar he told his companions, among whom I was one, <br/>
to stop. Then he said: </p>
<p>‘O God, Lord of the heavens and what they o’ershadow </p>
<p>757 And Lord of the lands and what they make to grow <br/>
And Lord of the devils and what into error they throw <br/>
And Lord of the winds and what they winnow, </p>
<p>1 V.*. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 511 </p>
<p>We ask Thee for the good of this town and the good of its people and the <br/>
good of what is in it, and we take refuge in Thee from its evil and the evil <br/>
of its people and the evil that is in it. Forward in the name of Allah.’ He <br/>
used to say that of every town he entered. </p>
<p>One whom I do not suspect told me from Anas b. Malik: When the <br/>
apostle raided a people he waited until the morning. If he heard a call to <br/>
prayer 1 he held back; if he did not hear it he attacked. We came to Khaybar <br/>
by night, and the apostle passed the night there; and when morning came <br/>
he did not hear the call to prayer, 1 so he rode and we rode with him, and I <br/>
rode behind Abu Talha with my foot touching the apostle’s foot. We met <br/>
the workers of Khaybar coming out in the morning with their spades and <br/>
baskets. When they saw the apostle and the army they cried, ‘Muhammad <br/>
with his force,’ and turned tail and fled. The apostle said, ‘Allah akbar! <br/>
Khaybar is destroyed. When we arrive in a people’s square it is a bad <br/>
morning for those who have been warned.’ Harun told us from Humayd <br/>
from Anas similarly. </p>
<p>When the apostle marched from Medina to Khaybar he went by way of <br/>
'Isr, 2 and a mosque was built for him there; then by way of al-Sahba’. 3 <br/>
Then he went forward with the army until he halted in a wadi called al- <br/>
Rajl', halting between the men of Khaybar and Ghatafan so as to prevent <br/>
the latter reinforcing Khaybar, for they were on their side against the apostle. </p>
<p>I have heard that when Ghatafan heard about the apostle’s attack on <br/>
Khaybar they gathered together and marched out to help the Jew's against <br/>
him; but after a day’s journey, hearing a rumour about their property and <br/>
families, they thought that they had been attacked during their absence, so <br/>
they went back on their tracks and left the way to Khaybar open to the apostle. 758 </p>
<p>The apostle seized the property piece by piece and conquered the forts <br/>
one by one as he came to them. The first to fall was the fort of Na'im; <br/>
there Mahmud b. Maslama was killed by a millstone which was thrown on <br/>
him from it; then al-Qamus the fort of B. Abu’l-Huqayq. The apostle <br/>
took captives from them among whom was Safiya d. Huyayy b. Akhtab <br/>
who had been the vrife of Kinana b. al-Rabi' b. Abu’l-Huqayq, and two <br/>
cousins of hers. The apostle chose Safiya foj himself. </p>
<p>Dihya b. Khalifa al-Kalbl had asked the apostle for Safiya, and when he <br/>
chose her for himself he gave him her two cousins. The women of Khaybar <br/>
were distributed among the Muslims. The Muslims ate the meat of the <br/>
domestic donkeys and the apostle got up and forbade the people to do a <br/>
number of things which he enumerated. </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. 'Amr b. Damra al-Fazarl told me from 'Abdullah b. Abu <br/>
Salit from his father: The apostle’s prohibition of the flesh of domestic <br/>
donkeys reached us as the pots were boiling with it, so we turned them <br/>
upside down. </p>
<p>1 This is the usual meaning of adhdn, but probably here a more genera! term is indicated: </p>
<p>'a call to get up and work’. 2 A mountain between Medina and Wadi’l-Fur' </p>
<p>3 An evening’s journey from Khaybar. </p>
<p>512 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. Abu Najih told me from Makhul that the apostle prohibited <br/>
four things that day: carnal intercourse with pregnant women who were <br/>
captured; eating the flesh of domestic donkeys; eating any carnivorous <br/>
animal; and selling booty before it had been duly allotted. </p>
<p>Sallam b. Kirkira told me from 'Amr b. Dinar from Jabir b. 'Abdullah <br/>
al-Ansar! (Jabir had not been present at Khaybar) that when the apostle <br/>
forbade the flesh of donkeys he allowed them to eat horseflesh. </p>
<p>759 Yazld b. Abu Habib told me from Abu Marzuq client of Tujib from <br/>
Hanash al-San'ani: With Ruwayfi' b. Thabit al-Ansari we attacked the <br/>
Maghrib, and one of its towns called Jirba 1 was conquered. A man arose <br/>
as a preacher and said, ‘Let me tell you what I heard the apostle say on the <br/>
day of Khaybar. He got up among us and said: “It is not lawful for a man <br/>
who believes in Allah and the last day to mingle his seed with another man’s <br/>
(meaning to approach carnally a pregnant woman among the captives), nor <br/>
is it lawful for him to take her until he has made sure that she is in a state <br/>
of cleanness; nor is it lawful for him to sell booty until it has been properly <br/>
divided; nor is it lawful for him to ride an animal belonging to the booty of <br/>
the Muslims with the intention of returning it to the pool when he has <br/>
worn it out; nor is it lawful for him to wear a garment belonging to the <br/>
booty of the Muslims with the intention of returning it to the pool when <br/>
he has reduced it to rags.”’ </p>
<p>Yazid b. 'Abdullah b. Qusayt told me that he was told from 'Ubada b. <br/>
al-Samit: On the day of Khaybar the apostle forbade us to buy or sell gold <br/>
ore for gold coin or silver ore for silver coin. He said, ‘Buy gold ore with <br/>
silver coin and silver ore with gold coin.’ Then the apostle began to take <br/>
the forts and the property one by one. </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr told me that one of Aslam told him that B. Sahm <br/>
of Aslam came to the apostle and complained that they had fought and got <br/>
nothing and found nothing with the apostle which he could give them. He <br/>
said: !0 God, You know their condition and that they have no strength, <br/>
and that I have nothing to give them, so conquer for them the wealthiest <br/>
of the enemy’s forts with the richest food.’ The follpwing day God con¬ <br/>
quered the fort of al-Sa'b b. Mu'adh which contained the richest food in <br/>
Khaybar. </p>
<p>760 When the apostle had conquered some of their forts and got possession <br/>
of some of their property he came to their two forts al-Watlh and al-Sula- <br/>
lim, the last to be taken, and the apostle besieged them for some ten nights <br/>
(760). </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. Sahl b. 'Abdu’l-Rahman b. Sahl, brother of B. Haritha, <br/>
told me from Jabir b. 'Abdullah: Marhab the Jew came out from their fort <br/>
carrying his weapons and saying: </p>
<p>Khaybar knows that I am Marhab, </p>
<p>An experienced warrior armed from head to foot, </p>
<p>1 An island near Qabis. </p>
<p>5 l 3 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Now piercing, now slashing, </p>
<p>As when lions advance in their rage. </p>
<p>The hardened warrior gives way before my onslaught; </p>
<p>My himd 1 cannot be approached. </p>
<p>With these words he challenged all to single combat and Ka'b b. Mslik <br/>
answered him thus: </p>
<p>Khaybar knows that I am Ka'b, </p>
<p>The smoother of difficulties, bold and dour. </p>
<p>When war is stirred up another follows. </p>
<p>I carry a sharp sword that glitters like lightning— </p>
<p>We will tread you down till the strong are humbled; </p>
<p>We will make you pay till the spoil is divided— </p>
<p>In the hand of a warrior sans reproche (761).* </p>
<p>The apostle said, ‘Who will deal with this fellow?’ Muhammad b. <br/>
Maslama said that he would, for he was bound to take revenge on the man 761 <br/>
who had killed his brother the day before. The apostle told him to go and <br/>
prayed Allah to help him. When they approached the one the other an <br/>
old tree with soft wpod 3 lay between them and they began to hide behind <br/>
it. Each took shelter from the other. When one hid behind the tree the <br/>
other slashed at it with his sword so that the intervening branches were <br/>
cut away 4 and they came face to face. The tree remained bereft of its <br/>
branches like a man standing upright. Then Marhab attacked Muhammad <br/>
b. Maslama and struck him. He took the blow on his shield and the sword <br/>
bit into it and remained fast. Muhammad then gave Marhab a fatal wound. </p>
<p>After Marhab’s death his brother Yasir came out with his challenge: </p>
<p>(Khaybar knows that I am Yasir, T* 1578 </p>
<p>Fully armed, a doughty warrior. </p>
<p>As when lions advance at a rush </p>
<p>The enemy give way before my onslaught.) </p>
<p>Hisham b. ‘Urwa alleged that al-Zubayr b. al-'Awwam went out to fight <br/>
Yasir. His mother Saflya d. 'Abdu’l-Muttalib said, ‘Will he kill my son, O <br/>
apostle?’ He replied, ‘Nay, your son will kill him, if God will.’ So al- <br/>
Zubayr went out saying (T. </p>
<p>Khaybar know that I am Zabbar, </p>
<p>Chief of a people no cowardly runaways, </p>
<p>The son of those who defend their glory, the son of princes. </p>
<p>1 The sacred territory of an idol or a sanctuary and so any place that a man is bound to <br/>
protect from violation. .... </p>

<p>O Yasir, let not all the unbelievers deceive you, </p>
<p>For all of them are like a slowly moving mirage). </p>
<p>When the two met al-Zubayr killed Yasir. </p>
<p>Hisham b. 'Urwa told me that it was said to al-Zubayr, ‘By God, you <br/>
must have had a sharp sword that day/ to which he replied that it was not </p>
<p>sharp, but he used it with great force. </p>
<p>Burayda b. Sufyan b. Farwa al-AsIaml told me from his father Sufyan <br/>
from Salama b. 'Amr b. al-Akwa : The apostle sent Abu Bakr with his <br/>
banner (762) against one of the forts of Khaybar. He fought but returne <br/>
having suffered losses and not taken it. On the morrow he sent 'Umar and <br/>
the same thing happened. The apostle said, Tomorrow I will give the flag <br/>
to a man who loves Allah and his apostle. Allah will conquer it by his <br/>
762 means; he is no runaway.’ So he called 'All who was suffering from oph¬ <br/>
thalmia at the time and spat in his eye, saying, ‘Take this flag and go with it <br/>
until God gives victory through you.’ So 'Ali went off with it, gasping as <br/>
he hurried, while we followed behind in his tracks until he stuck the flag <br/>
in a pile of rocks under the fort. A Jew looked at him from the top of the <br/>
fort and asked who he was, and when he told him he said, You have won, <br/>
by what was revealed to Moses!’ 1 or words to that effect. He did not return <br/>
until God had conquered by his hands. </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. al-Hasan told me from one of his family from Abu Raff, <br/>
freed slave of the apostle: We went with 'Ali when the apostle sent him <br/>
with his flag and when he got near the fort the garrison came out and he <br/>
fought them. A Jew struck him so that his shield fell from his hand, so <br/>
'All laid hold of a door by the fort and used it as a shield. He kept it in his <br/>
hand as he fought until God gave victory, throwing it away when all was <br/>
over. I can see myself with seven others trying to turn that door over, but <br/>
we could not. </p>
<p>Burayda b. Sufyan al-Aslami told me from one of B. Salima from Abu I- <br/>
Yasar Ka'b b. 'Amr: We were with the apostle one evening at Khaybar <br/>
when along came some sheep belonging to a Jew, making for their fort <br/>
while we were besieging them. The apostle asked who would get this food <br/>
for us and Abu 1 -Yasar volunteered to go. He said, ‘I went out running like <br/>
an ostrich, and when the apostle saw me coming back he said O God, may <br/>
we long enjoy him.” I had overtaken the flock as the first sheep entered the <br/>
fort and I seized the two last and carried them off under my arms, bringing <br/>
them back at a run as though I carried nothing until I cast them down <br/>
before the apostle. They were duly killed and eaten. ’ Abu’l-Yasar was <br/>
the last of the apostle’s companions to die. Whenever he told this story he <br/>
763 used to weep, saying, ‘They did enjoy me a long time; indeed I am the last <br/>
of them.’ </p>
<p>When the apostle had conquered al-Qamus the fort of B. Abu 1 -Huqayq, <br/>
Saflya d. Huyayy b. Akhtab was brought to him along with another woman. </p>
<p>1 Apparently the Jew takes the name ‘Ali as an omen when he says alautum. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 515 </p>
<p>Bilal who was bringing them led them past the Jews who were slain; and <br/>
when the woman who was with Saflya saw them she shrieked and slapped <br/>
her face and poured dust on her head. When the apostle saw her he said, </p>
<p>‘Take this she-devil away from me.’ He gave orders that Saflya was to be <br/>
put behind him and threw his mantle over her, so that the Muslims knew <br/>
that he had chosen her for himself. I have heard that the apostle said to <br/>
Bilal when he saw this Jewess behaving in that way, ‘Had you no compas¬ <br/>
sion, Bilal, when you brought two women past their dead husbands ?’ Now <br/>
Saflya had seen in a dream when she was the wife of Kinana b. al-Rabi' b. <br/>
Abu’l-Huqayq that the moon would fall into her lap. When she told her <br/>
husband he said, ‘This simply means that you covet the king of the Hijaz, <br/>
Muhammad.’ He gave her such a blow in the face that he blacked her eye. </p>
<p>When she was brought to the apostle the mark was still there, and when he <br/>
asked the cause of it she told him this story. </p>
<p>THE REST OF THE AFFAIR OF KHAYBAR </p>
<p>Kinana b. al-Rabi', who had the custody of the treasure of B. al-Nadlr, was <br/>
brought to the apostle who asked him about it. He denied that he knew <br/>
where it was. A Jew came (T. was brought) to the apostle and said that he T&gt; 1582 <br/>
had seen Kinana going round a certain ruin every morning early. When <br/>
the apostle said to Kinana, ‘Do you know that if we find you have it I shall <br/>
kill you?’ he said Yes. The apostle gave orders that the ruin was to be <br/>
excavated and some of the treasure was found. When he asked him about <br/>
the rest he refused to produce it, so the apostle gave orders to al-Zubayr b. <br/>
al-'Awwam, ‘Torture him until you extract what he has,’ so he kindled a 764 <br/>
fire with flint and steel on his chest until he was nearly dead. Then the <br/>
apostle delivered him to Muhammad b. Maslama and he struck off his head, <br/>
in revenge for his brother Mahmud. </p>
<p><em>The apostle besieged the people of Khaybar in their two forts al-Watih <br/>
and al-Sulalim until when they could hold out no longer they asked him to <br/>
let them go, and spare their lives, and he did so. Now the apostle had <br/>
taken possession of all their property—al-Shaqq, Nata, and al-Katlba and <br/>
all their forts—except what appertained to these two.</em> When the people <br/>
of Fadak heard of what had happened they sent to the apostle asking him <br/>
to let them go and to spare their lives and they would leave him their <br/>
property, and he did so. The one who acted as intermediary was Muhay- <br/>
yisa b. Mas'ud, brother of B. Haritha. 1 When the people of Khaybar sur¬ <br/>
rendered on these conditions they asked the apostle to employ them on the <br/>
property with half share in the produce, saying, ‘We know more about it - <br/>
than you and we are better farmers.’ The apostle agreed to this arrange¬ <br/>
ment on the condition that ‘if we wish to expel you we will expel you.’ He <br/>
made a similar arrangement with the men of Fadak. So Khaybar became </p>

</ul>
<p>1 Cf. Bal. 29 f. </p>
<p>516 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>the prey of the Muslims, while Fadak was the personal property of the <br/>
apostle because they had not driven horses or camels against it. 1 </p>
<p>When the apostle had rested Zaynab d. al-Harith, the wife of Sallam b. <br/>
Mishkam prepared for him a roast lamb, having first inquired what joint <br/>
he preferred. When she learned that it was the shoulder she put a lot of <br/>
poison in it and poisoned the whole lamb. Then she brought it in and <br/>
placed it before him. He took hold of the shoulder and chewed a morsel of <br/>
it, but he did not swallow it. Bishr b. al-Bara’ b. Ma'rur wffio was with him </p>
<p>765 took some of it as the apostle had done, but he swallowed it, while the <br/>
apostle spat it out, saying, ‘This bone tells me that it is poisoned.’ Then he <br/>
called for the woman and she confessed, and when he asked her what had <br/>
induced her to do this she answered: ‘You know what you have done to my <br/>
people. I said to myself, If he is a king I shall ease myself of him and if he <br/>
is a prophet he will be informed (of what I have done).’ So the apostle let <br/>
her off. Bishr died from what he had eaten. </p>
<p>Marwan b. 'Uthman b. Abu Sa'id b. al-Mu'alla told me: The apostle <br/>
had said in his illness of which he was to die when Umm Bishr d. al-Bara’ <br/>
came to visit him, ‘O Umm Bishr, this is the time in which I feel a deadly <br/>
pain from what I ate with your brother at Khaybar.’ The Muslims con¬ <br/>
sidered that the apostle died as a martyr in addition to the prophetic office <br/>
with which God had honoured him. </p>
<p>Having finished with Khaybar, the apostle went to Wadi’l-Qura and <br/>
besieged its people for some nights, then he left to return to Medina. </p>
<p>Thaur b. Zayd told me from Salim, freed slave of 'Abdullah b. Mutf <br/>
from Abu Hurayra, who said: When we left Khaybar to go to Wadi’l-Qura <br/>
with the apostle we halted there in the evening as the sun was setting. The <br/>
apostle had a slave which Rifa'a b. Zayd al-Judhaml, of the clan al- <br/>
Qubaybi, had given him (763). He was laying down the apostle’s saddle <br/>
when suddenly a random arrow hit him and killed him. We congratulated <br/>
him on paradise, but the apostle said, ‘Certainly not. His cloak is even now <br/>
burning on him in Hell. He had surreptitiously stolen it on the day of <br/>
Khaybar from the spoil of the Muslims.’ One of his companions heard this <br/>
and came to him saying, ‘I took two sandal thongs.’ He said, ‘Two thongs <br/>
of fire will be cut for you like them.’ </p>
<p>766 One I do not suspect told me from 'Abdullah b. Mughaffal al-Muzani: <br/>
‘I took a bag of lard from the booty of Khaybar and carried it off on my <br/>
shoulder to my companions, when the man who had been put over the <br/>
spoil met me and'laid hold of the end of it, saying, “Hie! This we must <br/>
divide among the Muslims.” I said that I would not give him it and he <br/>
began to try and pull the bag away from me. The apostle saw what was <br/>
happening and laughed. Then he said to the officer in charge of the spoil <br/>
“Let him have it, confound you,” so he let go of it and I went off to my <br/>
companions and we ate it.’ </p>
<p>When the apostle married Safiya in Khaybar or on the way, she having <br/>
1 Cf. Sura 17. 66, i.e. captured it by force of arms. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 5x7 </p>
<p>been beautified and combed, and got in a fit state for the apostle by Umm <br/>
Sulaym d. Milhan mother of Anas b. Malik, the apostle passed the night <br/>
with^her in a tent of his. Abu Ayyub, Khalid b. Zayd brother of B. al- <br/>
■^ a jj^ r passed the night girt with his sword, guarding the apostle and going <br/>
round the tent until in the morning the apostle saw him there and asked <br/>
him what he meant by his action. He replied, ‘I was afraid for you with this <br/>
woman for you have killed her father, her husband, and her people, and till <br/>
recently she was in unbelief, so I was afraid for you on her account.’ They <br/>
allege that the apostle said ‘O God, preserve Abu Ayyub as he spent the <br/>
night preserving me.’ </p>
<p>Al-Zuhri told me from Sa'id b. al-Musayyab: When the apostle left <br/>
Khaybar and was on the way he said towards the end of the night: ‘Who <br/>
will watch over us till the dawn so that we may sleep?’ Bilal volunteered <br/>
to do so, so all lay down and slept. Bilal got up and prayed as long as God <br/>
willed that he should; then he propped himself against his camel, and there <br/>
was the dawn as he was looking at it, and his eyes were heavy and he slept. <br/>
The first thing to wake the others was the feel of the sun. The apostle was <br/>
the first to wake up and he asked Bilal what he had done to them. He said <br/>
that the same thing had happened to him as had happened to the apostle <br/>
and he admitted that he was right. Then the apostle let himself be taken a <br/>
short distance; then he made his camel kneel, and he and the men per¬ <br/>
formed their ablutions. Then he ordered Bilal to call to prayer, and the <br/>
apostle led them in prayer. Having finished he went to them and said ‘If <br/>
you forget your prayers, pray them when you remember them, for Godhas <br/>
said, Perform prayer for My remembrance.’” 1 </p>
<p>I have heard that the apostle gave Ibn Luqaym al-'Absi the hens and <br/>
domestic animals which were in Khaybar. The conquest took place in <br/>
oafar. Ibn Luqaym said: </p>
<p>Nata was stormed by the apostle’s squadron <br/>
Fully armed, powerful, and strong. </p>
<p>It was certain of humiliation when it was split up <br/>
With the men of Aslam and Ghifar in its midst. </p>
<p>They attacked B. ‘Amr b. Zur'a in the morning <br/>
And Shaqq’s people met a day of gloom. </p>
<p>They trailed their cloaks 2 in their plains <br/>
And left only hens cackling among the trees. 3 <br/>
Every fort had a man of 'Abdu’l-Ashhal or B. al-Najjar <br/>
Busy with their horses, </p>
<p>And Emigrants who had displayed their badges <br/>
Above their helms, never thinking of flight. </p>
<p>I knew that Muhammad would conquer <br/>
And would stay there many Safars. </p>
<p>1 Sura 20. 14. </p>
<p>3 r 5 reading ‘They made the cocks run’ may be right. </p>
<p>518 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>The Jews in the fighting that day <br/>
Opened their eyes in the dust (764). 1 </p>
<p>Some Muslim women were with the apostle at Khaybar, and the apostle <br/>
allowed them a small portion of the booty. He did not give them a definite <br/>
share. </p>
<p>768 Sulayman b. Suhaym told me from Umayya b. Abu’l-Salt from a <br/>
woman of B. Ghifar whom he named to me: She said, ‘I came to the <br/>
apostle with some women of B. Ghifar and we told the apostle, as he was <br/>
going to Khaybar, that we wanted to go with him where he went, to tend <br/>
the wounded and to help the Muslims as far as we could. He told us to go <br/>
with God’s blessing, and so we went with him. I was a young girl and the <br/>
apostle took me on the back of his saddle. When the apostle dismounted <br/>
for morning prayer and I got off the back of his saddle, lo, some of my <br/>
blood w r as on it. It was the first time that this had happened to me. I <br/>
rushed to the camel in my shame. When the apostle saw my distress and <br/>
the blood he guessed the reason and told me to cleanse myself; then to take <br/>
water and put some salt in it, and then to wash the back of the saddle and <br/>
go back to my mount.’ </p>
<p>She added: ‘When the apostle conquered Khaybar he gave us a small <br/>
part of the booty. He took this necklace which you see on my neck and <br/>
gave it to me and hung it round my neck with his own hand, and by God it <br/>
will never leave me.’ It was on her neck until she died when she gave <br/>
instructions that it was to be buried with her. She never cleansed herself <br/>
but she put salt in the purifying water, and gave instructions that it should <br/>
be put in the water with which she was w^ashed when she was dead. </p>
<p>The names of the Muslims who met martyrdom at Khaybar are: of </p>
<p>769 Quraysh of the clan of B. Umayya b. 'Abdu Shams of their allies: Rabl'a b. <br/>
Aktham b. Sakhbara b. 'Arar, and Rifa'a b. 'Amir b. Ghanm b. Dudan b. <br/>
Asad, and Thaqif b. 'Amr and Rifa'a b. Masruh. Of B. Asad b. 'Abdu’l- <br/>
'Uzza: 'Abdullah b. al Hubayb (765). Of the Ansar of B. Salima: Bishr b. <br/>
al-Bara’ b. Ma'rur who died of the mutton with which the apostle was <br/>
poisoned, and Fudayl b. al-Nu'man, 2 men. Of B. Zurayq: Mas'ud b. Sa'd <br/>

<p>Of those who found martyrdom at Khaybar according to what Ibn <br/>

<p>The Life of Muhammad 519 </p>
<p>THE AFFAIR OF AL-ASWAD THE SHEPHERD <br/>
According to what I have heard al-Aswad came to the apostle with his <br/>
flock of sheep as he was besieging Khaybar. He was the hired servant of a <br/>
Jew there. He asked the apostle to explain Islam to him, and when he did <br/>
so he accepted it, for the apostle never thought too little of anyone to invite <br/>
him to accept Islam. Having become a Muslim he told the apostle that he <br/>
was the hired servant of the owner of the sheep which were entrusted to <br/>
his care, and what was he to do with them ? He told him to hit them in the <br/>
face and they w'ould go back to their owner. So al-Aswad got up and took 770 <br/>
a handful of pebbles and threw them in their faces, saying, ‘Go back to <br/>
your master, for I will look after you no more.’ They went off in a body as <br/>
though someone were driving them, until they went into the fort. After¬ <br/>
wards he advanced to the fort with the Muslims and was struck by a stone <br/>
and killed, never having prayed a single prayer. He was brought to the <br/>
apostle and laid behind him and covered by his shepherd’s cloak. The <br/>
apostle, who was accompanied by a number of his companions, turned <br/>
towards him and then turned away. When they asked him why, he said, </p>
<p>‘He has with him now his two wives from the dark-eyed houris.’ </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. Abu Najlh told me that he was told that, when a martyr is <br/>
slain, his two wives from the dark-eyed houris pet him, wiping the dust from <br/>
his face, saying the while, ‘May God put dust on the face of the man who <br/>
put dust on your face, and slay him who slew you!’ </p>
<p>THE AFFAIR OF AL-HAJJAJ B. 'ilA? AL-SULAMl </p>
<p>When Kaybar had been conquered al-Hajjaj b. 'Hat al-Sulami of the clan <br/>
al-Bahz said to the apostle, ‘I have money with my wife Umm Shayba d. </p>
<p>Abu Talha—when they had lived together he had a son called Mu'rid by <br/>
her—and money scattered among the Meccan merchants, so give me per¬ <br/>
mission to go and get it.’ Having got his permission he said, ‘I must tell <br/>
lies, O apostle.’ He said, ‘Tell them.’ ‘Al-Hajjaj said, ‘When I came to <br/>
Mecca I found in the pass of al-Bayda’ 1 some men of Quraysh trying to get <br/>
news and asking how the apostle fared because they had heard that he had <br/>
gone to Khaybar. They knew that it was the principal town of the Hijaz <br/>
in fertility, fortifications, and population, and they were searching for news <br/>
and interrogating passing riders. They did not know that I was a Muslim <br/>
and when they saw me they said, “It is al-Hajjaj b. Tlat. He is sure to <br/>
have news. Tell us, O Abu Muhammad, for we have heard that the high¬ <br/>
wayman has gone to Khaybar which is the town of the Jews and the garden <br/>
of the Hijaz.” I said, “I have heard that and I have some news that will <br/>
please you.” They came up eagerly on either side of my camel, saying, </p>
<p>“Out with it, Hajjaj!” I said, “He has suffered a defeat such as you have 771 <br/>
never heard of and his companions have been slaughtered; you have never <br/>
heard the like, and Muhammad has been captured.” The men of Khaybar <br/>
1 The pass of ai-Tan'lm in Mecca. </p>
<p>520 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>said, “We will not kill him until we send him to the Meccans and let them <br/>
kill him among themselves in revenge for their men whom he has killed.” <br/>
They got up and shouted in Mecca, “Here’s news for you! You have only <br/>
to wait for this fellow Muhammad to be sent to you to be killed in your <br/>
midst.” I said, “Help me to collect my money in Mecca and to get in the <br/>
money owed to me, for I want to go to Khaybar to get hold of the fugitives <br/>
from Muhammad and his companions 1 before the merchants get there” <br/>
(767). They got up and collected my money for me quicker than I could <br/>
have supposed possible. I went to my wife and asked her for the money <br/>
which she had by her, telling her that I should probably go to Khaybar <br/>
and seize the opportunity to buy before the merchants got there first. <br/>
When 'Abbas heard the news and heard about me he came and stood at <br/>
my side as I was in one of the merchants’ tents, asking about the new r s <br/>
which I had brought. I asked him if he could keep a secret if I entrusted it <br/>
to him. He said he could, anti I said, “Then wait until I can meet you <br/>
T<em> 1587 privately, for I am collecting my money as you see, so leave me (T. and he <br/>
left me) until I have finished”; and so, when I had collected everything I <br/>
had in Mecca and decided to leave, I met 'Abbas and said, “Keep my story <br/>
secret for three nights, then say what you- will for I am afraid of being pur¬ <br/>
sued.” When he said that he would, I said, “I left your brother’s son <br/>
married to the daughter of their king, meaning Saftya, and Khaybar has <br/>
been conquered and all that is in it removed and become the property of <br/>
Muhammad and his companions.” He said, “What are you saying, Haj- <br/>
jaj ?” I said, “Yes, by Allah, but keep my secret. I have become a Muslim <br/>
and have come only to get my money fearing that I may be deprived of it. <br/>
When three nights have passed publish the news as you will.” When the <br/>
third day came 'Abbas put on a robe of his and scented himself and took <br/>
77 * his stick, and went to the Ka'ba and went round it. When the people <br/>
saw</em> him they said, “O Abu’l-Fadl, this is indeed steadfastness in a great <br/>
misfortune!” He answered, “By no means, by Allah by whom you swear, <br/>
Muhammad has conquered Khaybar and was left married to the daughter <br/>
of their king. He has seized all that they possess and it is now his property <br/>
and the property of his companions.” They asked, “Who brought you <br/>
this news ?” He said, “The man who brought you your news. He came in <br/>
to you as a Muslim and has taken his money and gone off to join Muham¬ <br/>
mad and his companions and to be with him.” They said “O men of Allah, <br/>
the enemy of Allah has escaped. Had we known we would have dealt with <br/>
him.” Almost at once the true news reached them.’ </p>
<p>Among the verses about the day of Khaybar are the following from <br/>
Hassan b. Thabit: </p>
<p>How badly the Khaybarls fought </p>
<p>To preserve their crops and dates! </p>
<p>1 The word fall, for which I.H. quotes the variant fay', ‘spoil’, may possibly mean the <br/>
tame thing: more often it means a defeated force. Perhaps we could render ‘to get some <br/>
advantage from the defeat of Muhammad and his companions’. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 521 </p>
<p>They disliked the thought of death and so their preserve became a </p>
<p>spoil </p>
<p>And they behaved like miserable cowards. </p>
<p>Would they flee from death ? </p>
<p>The death of the starved is not seemly. </p>
<p>Hassan also said, excusing Ay man b. Umm Ayman b. 'Ubayd who had <br/>
stayed behind from Khaybar (he was of B. 'Auf b. al-Khazraj. His <br/>
mother Umm Ayman was a freed slave of the apostle, the mother of Usama <br/>
b. Zayd who was thus brother to Ayman by his mother): </p>
<p>At the time when Ayman’s mother said to him </p>
<p>You are a coward and were not with the horsemen of Khaybar </p>
<p>Ayman was no coward, but his horse </p>
<p>Was sick from drinking fermented barley-water. </p>
<p>Had it not been for the state of his horse </p>
<p>He would have fought with them as a horseman with his right hand. </p>
<p>What stopped him was the behaviour of his horse </p>
<p>And what had happened to it seemed to him more serious (768). </p>
<p>Najiya b. Jundub al-Aslaml said: </p>
<p>O servants of Allah, why do you prize 773 </p>

<p>THE ACCOUNT OF THE DIVISION OF THE SPOIL OF <br/>
KHAYBAR </p>
<p>When the spoil of Khaybar was divided, al-Shaqq and Nata fell to the <br/>
Muslims while al-Katlba was divided into five sections: God’s fifth; the <br/>
prophet’s share (T. fifth); the share of kindred, orphans, the poor (T. and T- 158 <br/>
wayfarers); maintenance of the prophet’s wives; and maintenance of the <br/>
men who acted as intermediaries in the peace negotiations with the men of <br/>
Fadak. To Muhayyisa, who was one of these men, the apostle gave thirty 774 <br/>
loads of barley and thirty loads of dates. Khaybar was apportioned among <br/>
the men of al-Hudaybiya without regard to whether they w r ere present at <br/>
Khaybar or not. Only Jabir b. 'Abdullah b. 'Amr b. Haram was absent <br/>
and the apostle gave him the same share as the others. Its two wadis, al- <br/>
Surayr and Khass, formed the territory into which Khaybar w r as divided. </p>
<p>Nata and al-Shaqq formed 18 shares of which Nata formed 5 and al-Shaqq <br/>
13. These two places w f ere divided into 1,800 shares. </p>
<p>5 22 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>The number of the companions among whom Khaybar was divided was <br/>
1,800 with shares for horse and foot; 1,400 men and 200 horses; every <br/>
horse got two shares and his rider one; every footman got one share. There <br/>
was a chief over every allotment for every too men, i.e. 18 blocks of shares </p>
<p>( 77 °)- </p>
<p>The chiefs were 'All; al-Zubayr b. al-'Awwam; Talha b. 'Ubaydullah; <br/>
'Umar; 'Abdu’l-Rahman; 'Asim b. 'Adiy; Usayd b. Hudayr. Then the <br/>
share of al-Harith b. al-Khazraj; then the share in Na'im; then the share of <br/>
B. Bayada, B. 'Ubayd, B. Haram of B. Salima, and 'Ubayd ‘of the shares’ <br/>
( 77 1 ), Saida, Ghifar and Aslam, al-Najjar, Haritha, and Aus. </p>
<p>The first lot in Nata fell to al-Zubayr, namely al-Khau', and al-Surayr <br/>
775 followed it; the second to B. Bayada; the third to Usayd; the fourth to <br/>
B. al-Harith; the fifth in Na'im to B. 'Auf b. al-Khazraj and Muzayna <br/>
and their partners. In it Mahmud b. Maslama was killed. So much for <br/>
Nata. </p>
<p>Then they went down to al-Shaqq: the first lot fell to 'Asim b. 'Adiy <br/>
brother of B. al-'Ajlan and with it the apostle’s share; then the shares of <br/>
Abdu 1 -Rahman, Sa ida, al-Najjar, 'All, Talha, Ghifar and Aslam, 'Umar, <br/>
Salama b. 'Ubayd and B. Haram, Haritha, 'Ubayd ‘of the shares’; then the <br/>
share of Aus which was the share of al-Laflf to which Juhayna and the rest <br/>
of the Arabs who were at Khaybar was joined; opposite it was the apostle’s <br/>
share which he got with 'Asim’s share. 1 </p>
<p>Then the apostle distributed al-Katlba which is Wadi Khass between <br/>
his kindred and wives and to other men and women. He gave his daughter <br/>
Fatima 200 loads; 'Ali 100; Usama b. Zayd 200 and 50 loads of dates; <br/>
A isha 200; Abu Bakr 100; Aqll b. Abu Talib 140; B. Ja'far 30; Rabi'a b. <br/>
al-Harith 100; al-Salt b. Makhrama and his tw T o sons 100, 40 of them for <br/>
al-Salt himself; Abu Nabiqa 50; Rukana b. 'Abdu Yazid 50; Qays b. <br/>
Makhrama 30; his brother Abu’l-Qasim 40; the daughters of 'Ubayda b. <br/>
al-Harith and the daughter of al-Husayn b. al-Harith 100; B. 'Ubayd b. <br/>

<p>In the Name of Allah the Compassionate the Merciful. A memorandum <br/>
of what Muhammad the apostle of Allah gave his wives from the wheat of <br/>
Khaybar. He distributed to them 180 loads. He gave his daughter Fatima <br/>
85, Usama b. Zayd 40, al-Miqdad b. al-Aswad 15, Umm Rumaytha 5. <br/>
'Uthman b. 'Affan was witness and 'Abbas wrote the document. </p>
<p>Salih b. Kaysan told me from Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri from 'Ubaydullah b. <br/>
'Abdullah b. 'Utba b. Mas'ud: The only dispositions that the apostle made <br/>
at his death were three: He bequeathed to the Rahawis land which pro¬ <br/>
duced a hundred loads in Khaybar, to the Dariyls, the Saba’is, and the <br/>
Ash'aris the same. He also gave instructions that the mission of Usama b. <br/>
Zayd b. Haritha should be carried through 2 and that two religions should <br/>
not be allowed to remain in the peninsula of the Arabs. </p>
<p>THE AFFAIR OF FADAK </p>
<p>When the apostle had finished with Khaybar, God struck terror to the <br/>
hearts of the men of Fadak when they heard what the apostle had done to <br/>
the men of Khaybar. They sent to him an offer of peace on condition that <br/>
they should keep half of their produce. Their messengers came to him in <br/>
Khaybar or on the road 3 or after he came to Medina, and he accepted their <br/>
terms. Thus Fadak became his private property, because it had not been 777 <br/>
attacked by horse or camel. 4 </p>
<p>THE NAMES OF THE DARIYUN </p>
<p>They were B. al-Dar b. Hani’ b. Habib b. Numara b. Lakhm who had <br/>
come to the’ apostle from Syria, namely, Tamim b. Aus and Nu'aym his <br/>
brother, Yazid b. Qays, and 'Arafa b. Malik whom the apostle named <br/>
'Abdu’l-Rahman (773), and his brother Murran b. Malik, and Fakih b. <br/>
Nu'man, Jabala b. Malik, and Abu Hind b. Barr and his brother al-Tayyib <br/>
whom the apostle named 'Abdullah. </p>
<p>According to what 'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr told me the apostle used to <br/>
send to Khaybar 'Abdullah b. Rawaha to act as assessor between the Mus¬ <br/>
lims and the Jews. When he made his assessment they would say, ‘You <br/>
have wronged us,’ and he would say, ‘If you wish it is yours and if you like <br/>
it is ours,’ and the Jews would say, ‘On this (foundation) Heaven and earth <br/>
stand. s But 'Abdullah acted as assessor for one year only before he was </p>

<p>killed at Mu’ta. After him Jabbar b. Sakhr b. Umayya b. Khansa’ brother <br/>
of B. Salima took over the work. All went well and the Muslims found no <br/>
fault in their behaviour until they attacked 'Abdullah b. Sahl brother of B. <br/>
Haritha and killed him in violation of their agreement with the apostle, <br/>
and the apostle and the Muslims suspected them on that account. </p>
<p>Al-Zuhrl and Bushayr b. Yasar told me from Sahl b. Abu Hathma: <br/>
Abdullah b. Sahl was killed in Khaybar. He had gone there with friends <br/>
of his to take away the dates and was found in a pool with his neck broken, <br/>
having been thrown there. So they took him and buried him and then <br/>
778 came to the apostle and told him about the affair. His brother 'Abdu’l- <br/>
Rahman came to him accompanied by his two cousins Huwayyisa and <br/>
Muhayyisa the sons of Mas'ud. Now 'Abdu’l-Rahman was the youngest of <br/>
them and the avenger of blood and a prominent man among his people and <br/>
when he spoke before his two cousins the apostle said, ‘The eldest first, the <br/>
eldest first 1 ( 774 ) became silent. The two cousins then spoke and he </p>
<p>spoke after them. They told the apostle of the killing of their relative and <br/>
he said, ‘Can you name the killer, then swear fifty oaths against him that <br/>
we should deliver him up to you ?’ They said that they could not swear to <br/>
what they did not know. He said, ‘If they swear fifty oaths that they did <br/>
not kill him and do not know the slayer, will they be free from the guilt of <br/>
his blood ?’ They answered, ‘We cannot accept the oaths of Jews. Their <br/>
infidelity is so great that they would swear falsely/ The apostle paid the <br/>
bloodwit of a hundred she-camels from his own property. Sahl said, 1 ‘By <br/>
Allah, I shall not forget a young red camel who kicked me as I was leading <br/>
her/ </p>
<p>Muhammad b. Ibrahim b. al-Harith al-Taymi told me from 'Abdu’l- <br/>
Rahman b. Bujayd b. Qayzl brother of B. Haritha. Muhammad b, Ibrahim <br/>
said: By God, Sahl did not know more than he, but he w'as the elder. He <br/>
said to him, ‘By Allah, the affair was not thus but Sahl misunderstood. The <br/>
apostle did not say “Swear to something you have no knowledge of,” but <br/>
he wrote to the Jews of Khaybar when the Ansar spoke to him: “A dead <br/>
man has been found among your dwellings. Pay his bloodwit.” The Jews <br/>
wrote back swearing by Allah that they had not killed him and did not <br/>
know who had, so the apostle paid the blood-money/ </p>
<p>Amr b. Shu'ayb told me the same story as 'Abdu’l-Rahman except that <br/>
he said, Pay the blood-money or be prepared for war/ </p>
<p>779 I asked Ibn Shihab al-Zuhrl, 2 ‘How was it that the apostle gave the Jews <br/>
of Khaybar their palms when he gave them on a tax basis ? Did he assign <br/>
that to them until he was taken or did he give them them for some other <br/>
necessary reason?* He told me that the apostle took Khaybar by force </p>
<p>qdmat . . . al-ar 4 with Pirqe Abhoth j. 19 ‘on three things the world stands (qaim) : on <br/>
justice, truth, and peace' one can hardly doubt that 'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr has preserved <br/>
an accurate account of what took place. </p>
<p>I ® ahl *? the transmitter of the story. The avenger of blood was 'Abdu’l-Rahman b. Sahl. </p>
<p>_ This incident is reported by al-Baladburi from I,I. via al-Bakka 1 ! in an abbreviated <br/>
iorm. There is no significant difference* </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 525 </p>
<p>after fighting and Khaybar was part of what God gave to him as booty. <br/>
The apostle divided it into five parts and distributed it among the Muslims, <br/>
and after the fighting the population surrendered on condition that they <br/>
should migrate. The apostle called them and said that if they wished he <br/>
would let them have the property on condition that they worked it and the <br/>
produce was equally divided between both parties and he would leave them <br/>
there as long as God let them stay. They accepted the terms and used to <br/>
work the property on those conditions. The apostle used to send ‘Abdullah <br/>
b. Rawaha and he would divide the produce and make a just assessment. <br/>
When God took away His prophet, Abu Bakr continued the arrangement <br/>
until his death, and so did Umar for the beginning of his amlrate. Then <br/>
he heard that the apostle had said in his last illness, ‘Two religions shall not <br/>
remain together in the peninsula of the Arabs* and he made inquiries until <br/>
he got confirmation. Then he sent to the Jews saying, ‘God has given <br/>
permission for you to emigrate,’ quoting the apostle’s words. ‘If anyone <br/>
has an agreement with the apostle let him bring it to me and I will carry it <br/>
out; he who has no such agreement let him get ready to emigrate.’ Thus <br/>
‘Umar expelled those who had no agreement with the apostle. </p>
<p>Nafi‘ client of ‘Abdullah b. 'Umar told me from ‘Abdullah b. ‘Umar: <br/>
With al-Zubayr and al-Miqdad b. al-Aswad I went out to our property in <br/>
Khaybar to inspect it, and when we got there we separated to see to our <br/>
individual affairs. In the night I was attacked as I was asleep on my bed <br/>
and my arms were dislocated at the elbows. In the morning I called my <br/>
companions to my aid and when they came and asked me who had done <br/>
this I had to say that I did not know. They reset my arms and then took <br/>
me to 'Umar who said, ‘This is the work of the Jews.’ Then he got up <br/>
and addressed those present saying that the apostle had arranged with the <br/>
Jews of Khaybar that we could expel them if we wished; that they had <br/>
attacked Abdullah b. Umar and dislocated his arms, as they had heard, <br/>
in addition to their attack on the Ansar! previously. There was no doubt <br/>
that they were the authors of these outrages because there was no other <br/>
enemy on the spot. Therefore if anyone had property in Khaybar he <br/>
should go to it, for he was on the point of expelling the Jews. And he did <br/>
expel them. </p>
<p>Abdullah b. Abu Bakr told me from Abdullah b. Mhknaf brother of B. <br/>
Haritha: When 'Umar expelled the Jews from Khaybar he rode with the <br/>
Muhajirln and Ansar and Jabbar b. Sakhr b, Umayya b. Khansa’ brother <br/>
of B. Salima who was the assessor and accountant of the Medinans and <br/>
Yazld b. Thabit; and these two divided Khaybar among its owners accord¬ <br/>
ing to the original agreement of the lots. </p>
<p>'Umar divided Wadi’l-Qura into shares: 1 one each to 'Uthman, 'Abdu’l- </p>
<p>1 Khapftr. I.H. (note 777) says that the word means ‘share*. My colleague, Dr. R. B <br/>
Sergeant, Le Must on, lxvi, 1953, p . I3 o, writes of the Hadramaut: ‘The main bund or <br/>
channel leading the flood water from the wadi to the fields is called khatar (pi. khutur), a <br/>
word known to Ibn HishSm, Sira , p. 780.’ If 1 . 1 , meant ‘irrigation channel’, as is very </p>

b. Qays; one share to Ibn Hazama. Such is our information about the <br/>
allocation of Khaybar and Wadi’I-Qura (777). </p>
<p>THE RETURN OF THOSE WHO HAD MIGRATED TO <br/>
ABYSSINIA (778) </p>
<p>These are the names of the prophet’s companions who stayed in Abyssinia <br/>
until he sent 'Amr b. Umayya al-j)amrl to the Negus to fetch them back in <br/>
two boats and who ultimately rejoined him in Khaybar after al-Hudaybiya: </p>
<p>From B. Hashim: Ja'far b. Abu Talib with his wife Asma’d. 'Umays; 1 <br/>
and his son 'Abdullah who was born to him in Abyssinia. Ja'far was killed <br/>
at Mu’ta in Syria when acting as the apostle’s amir. 1 man. </p>
<p>From B. 'Abdu Shams: Khalid b. Sa'Id b. al-'As b. Umayya with his <br/>
wife Umayna d. Khalaf b. As'ad (779); his two children Sa'Id and Ama <br/>
begotten in Abyssinia (Khalid was killed at Marj al-Suffar 2 in the caliphate <br/>
of Abu Bakr); his brother 'Amr whose wife, Fatima d. Safwan b. Umayya </p>
<p>782 b. Muharrith al-Kinanl, died in Abyssinia ('Amr was killed at Ajnadayn in <br/>
Syria during the caliphate of Abu Bakr). </p>
<p>With reference to 'Amr b. Sa'Id his father Sa'Id b. al-'As b. Umayya <br/>
Abu Uhayha said: </p>
<p>O 'Amr, I wish that I knew about you whether <br/>
When you carry arms when your arms have grown strong <br/>
Will you leave your people’s affairs in such disorder <br/>
As will disclose the rage they retain in their breasts? </p>
<p>With reference to 'Amr and Khalid, their brother Aban said when the <br/>
former had become Muslims, and their father Sa'Id had died in al-Zurayba <br/>
in the region of Ta’if: </p>
<p>Would that a dead man in Zurayba could see </p>
<p>What 'Amr and Khalid are falsely introducing into religion! </p>
<p>probable, then the channels would mark out the limits of each man’s property or ‘share’. It <br/>
is difficult to escape the conclusion that such an unusual word was used in a technical sense. <br/>
It is not astonishing that a word of external origin should be used in this context because the <br/>
Arabs of the Hijaz in this epoch looked down on agriculture, and most of the terms they <br/>
used were borrow r ed from their neighbours. </p>

And assisted the very enemies we were fighting. </p>
<p>Khalid answered him and said: </p>
<p>I do not insult my brother’s honour since he is my brother </p>
<p>Though he does not refrain from evil words. </p>
<p>When affairs went ill with him he said, </p>
<p>‘Would that a man dead in Zurayba would rise from the grave!’ </p>

<p>Adly had a son called al-Nu'man who returned with the Muslims. In <br/>
the caliphate of 'Umar he was put over Maysan in the district of Basra. </p>
<p>He composed some verses: </p>
<p>Hasn’t al-Hasna’ 1 heard that her husband in Maysan <br/>
Is drinking from glasses and jars ? </p>
<p>If I washed, the chief men of the city would sing to me <br/>
And dancing-girls pirouette on tiptoe. </p>
<p>If you’re my friend, give me a drink in the largest cup, </p>
<p>Don’t give me the smallest half broken! </p>
<p>Perhaps the commander of the faithful will take it amiss <br/>
That we’re drinking together in a tumbledown castle! </p>
<p>When 'Umar heard of these verses he said: ‘He’s right, by God, I do <br/>
take it amiss! Anyone who sees him can tell him that I have deposed him.’ <br/>
After his deposition he came to 'Umar and pleaded that he had never <br/>
acted in the way that his verses implied, but that he was a poet who <br/>
wrote in their exaggerated way. 'Umar replied that as long as he lived he <br/>
would never act as his governor after having used such words. </p>

<p>THE FULFILLED PILGRIMAGE, 1 A.H. J </p>
<p>When the apostle returned from Khaybar to Medina he stayed there from <br/>
the first Rabf until Shawwal, sending out raiding parties and expeditions. <br/>
Then in Dhu’I-Qa'da—the month in which the polytheists had prevented <br/>
him from pilgrimage—he went out to make the ‘fulfilled pilgrimage’ (780) <br/>
in place of the ’umra from which they had excluded him. </p>
<p>789 Those Muslims who had been excluded with him went out in A.H. 7, and <br/>
when the Meccans heard of it they got out of his way. Quraysh said among <br/>
themselves, ‘Muhammad and his companions are in destitution, want, <br/>
and privation.’ </p>
<p>A man I have no reason to suspect told me that Ibn 'Abbas said: ‘They <br/>
gathered at the door of the assembly house to look at him and his com¬ <br/>
panions, and when the apostle entered the mosque he threw the end of his <br/>
cloak over his left shoulder leaving his right upper arm free. Th^n he said: <br/>
“God have mercy on a man who shows them today that he is strong.” <br/>
Then he kissed 2 the stone, and w r ent out trotting 3 as did his companions <br/>
until when the temple concealed him from them and he had kissed 2 the <br/>
southern comer he walked to kiss 2 the black stone. Then he trotted 3 simi- </p>
<p>1 The 'umra which can be performed at any time during the year, not the hajj which <br/>
must include a visit to 'Arafat. </p>
<p>2 istalama means to embrace with outstretched arms; to stroke with the hand; and to kiss. </p>
<p>3 harwala, says Burton, Pilgrimage (London, 1919, 167), is ‘very similar to the French pas <br/>
gymnastique, or tarammul, that is to say, "moving the shoulders as if walking in sand'” </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 531 </p>
<p>larly three circuits and walked the rest.’ Ibn 'Abbas used to say, ‘People <br/>
used to think that this practice w r as not incumbent on them because the <br/>
apostle only did it for this clan of Quraysh because of what he had heard <br/>
about them until when he made the farewell pilgrimage he adhered to it 1 <br/>
and the sunna carried it on.’ </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr told me that when the apostle entered Mecca on <br/>
that pilgrimage 'Abdullah b. Rawaha w r as holding the halter of his camel <br/>
and saying: </p>
<p>Get out of his way, you unbelievers, make w'ay. 2 <br/>
Every good thing goes with His apostle. </p>
<p>O Lord I believe in his word, </p>
<p>I know God’s truth in accepting it. </p>
<p>We will fight you about its interpretation 3 <br/>
As we have fought you about its revelation <br/>
With strokes that will remove heads from shoulders <br/>
And make friend unmindful of friend (781). </p>
<p>Aban b. Salih and 'Abdullah b. Abu Najih from 'Ata* b. Abu Rabah and 790 <br/>
Mujahid Abu’l-Hajjaj from Ibn 'Abbas told me that the apostle married <br/>
Maymunad. al-Harith in that journey of his when he was hardm. Al-'Abbas <br/>
b. 'Abdu’l-Muttalib married him to her (782). 4 </p>
<p>The apostle remained three days in Mecca. Hmvaytib b. 'Abdu’l- <br/>
'Uzza b. Abu Qays b. 'Abdu Wudd b. Nasr b. Malik b. Hisl w r ith a few <br/>
Quraysh came to him on the third day because Quraysh had entrusted him <br/>
with the duty of sending the apostle out of Mecca. They said: ‘Your time <br/>
is up, so get out from us.’ The apostle answered: ‘How would it harm you <br/>
if you were to let me stay and I gave a wedding feast among you and we <br/>
prepared food and you came too?’ They replied, ‘We don’t need your <br/>
food, so get out.’ So the apostle w r ent out and left Abu Rafi' his client in <br/>
charge of Mavmuna until he brought her to him in Sarif. 5 (T. The apostle <br/>
ordered them to change the (normal) sacrificial animal and did so himself. <br/>
Camels were hard to come by so he allowed them to offer oxen.) The <br/>
apostle consummated his marriage w r ith her there, and then w'ent on to <br/>
Medina in Dhu’l-Hijja (783). </p>
<p>THE RAID ON MU’TA IN A.H. 8 791 </p>
<p>He remained there for the rest of Dhu’l-Hijja, w r hile the polytheists super¬ <br/>

<p>Rabi's. In Jumada’l-tlla he sent to Syria his force which met with disaster <br/>
in Mu’ta. </p>
<p>Muhammad b. Ja'far b. al-Zubayr from 'Urwa b. al-Zubayr said: The <br/>
apostle sent his expedition to Mu’ta in Jumada’l-Ola in the year 8 and put <br/>
Zayd b. Haritha in command; if Zayd were slain then Ja'far b. Abu Talib <br/>
was to take command, and if he were killed then 'Abdullah b. Rawaha. <br/>
The expedition got ready to the number of 3,000 and prepared to start. <br/>
When they were about to set off they bade farewell to the apostle’s chiefs <br/>
and saluted them. When 'Abdullah b. Rawaha took his leave of the chiefs <br/>
he wept and when they asked him the reason he said, ‘By God, it is not that <br/>
I love the world and am inordinately attached to you, but I heard the <br/>
apostle read a verse from God’s book in which he mentioned hell; “There <br/>
is not one of you but shall come to it; that is a determined decree of your <br/>
Lord,” 1 and I do not know how I can return after I have been to it.’ The <br/>
Muslims said, ‘ God be with you and protect you and bring you back to us <br/>
safe and sound.’ 'Abdullah said: </p>
<p>But I ask the Merciful’s pardon </p>
<p>And a wide open wound discharging blood, </p>
<p>Or a deadly lance-thrust from a zealous warrior <br/>
That will pierce the bowels and liver; </p>
<p>So that men will say when they pass my grave, </p>
<p>‘God guide him, fine raider that he was, he did well!’ </p>
<p>79Z Then, when the people were about to start, 'Abdullah came to the apostle </p>
<p>to bid him farewell and said: </p>
<p>May God confirm the good things He gave you <br/>
As he confirmed them to Moses with victory. 2 <br/>
I perceived goodness in you by a natural gift. </p>
<p>God knows that I can see deeply. </p>
<p>You are the apostle and he who is deprived of his gifts <br/>
And the sight of him has no real worth (784). </p>
<p>Then the people marched forth, the apostle accompanying them until he <br/>
said farewell and returned. 'Abdullah said: </p>
<p>May peace remain on the best companion and friend, </p>
<p>The man I said good-bye to amid the palms. </p>
<p>They went on their way as far as Ma'an in Syria where they heard that <br/>
Heraclius had come down to Ma’ab in the Balqa’ with 100,000 Greeks <br/>
joined by 100,000 men from Lakhm and Judham and al-Qayn and Bahra’ <br/>
and Ball commanded by a man of Bali of Irasha called Malik b. Zafila. <br/>
When the Muslims heard this they spent two nights at Ma'an pondering <br/>
what to do. They were in favour of writing to the apostle to tell him of </p>
<p>1 Sura 19. 72. </p>
<ul>
<li>The dubious syntax and faulty rhyme in these lines is rightly corrected by I.H. </li>
</ul>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 533 </p>
<p>the enemy’s numbers; if he sent reinforcements well and good, otherwise <br/>
they would await his orders. 'Abdullah b. Rawaha encouraged the men <br/>
saying, ‘Men, what you dislike is that which you have come out in search <br/>
of, viz. martyrdom. We are not fighting the enemy with numbers, or <br/>
strength or multitude, but we are confronting (T. fighting) them with this <br/>
religion with which God has honoured us. So come on! Both prospects 793 <br/>
are fine: victory or martyrdom.’ The men said, ‘By God, Ibn Rawaha is <br/>
right.’ So they went forward and 'Abdullah said concerning their holding <br/>
back: </p>
<p>We urged on our horses from Aja’ and Far', 1 <br/>
Their bellies gorged with the grass they had eaten. </p>
<p>We gave them as shoes the smooth hard ground, </p>
<p>Its surface smooth as leather. </p>
<p>They stayed two nights at Ma'an; </p>
<p>After their rest they were full of spirit. </p>
<p>We went forward, our horses given free rein, </p>
<p>The hot wind blowing in their nostrils. </p>
<p>I swear that we will come to Ma’ab <br/>
Though Arabs and Greeks be there. </p>
<p>We arranged their bridles and they came furiously, </p>
<p>Their dust arose in streamers </p>
<p>With an army whose helmets as their points appeared <br/>
Seemed to shine like stars. </p>
<p>The woman who enjoys life our spears divorced. </p>
<p>She can remarry or remain a widow (785). </p>
<p>Then the army went forward, and 'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr told me that <br/>
he was told that Zayd b. Arqam said: I was an orphan child of 'Abdullah <br/>
b. Rawaha and he took me with him on this expedition riding on the back <br/>
of his saddle, and as he journeyed by night I heard him reciting these <br/>
verses of his: 2 </p>
<p>When you have brought me and carried my gear <br/>
A four nights’ journey from the swampy ground, </p>
<p>Then enjoy life and bear no blame </p>
<p>And may I never return to my people at home. (And when) </p>
<p>The Muslims have gone and left me <br/>
In Syria where I wish to be, </p>
<p>And a near relative of mine in God, </p>
<p>Though no blood relation, has brought you back, </p>
<p>There I shall not care for fruit that depends on rain <br/>
Or palms whose roots are watered by man. </p>
<p>I wept on hearing these words and he flicked me with his whip and said, </p>
<p>1 Two mountains of T a yyf- </p>
<p>2 He addresses his camel. </p>
<p>534 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>794 ‘Why worry, wretched fellow, if God grants me martyrdom and you return <br/>
firmly in the saddle?’ Then in one of his rajaz poems he said: </p>
<p>O Zayd, Zayd of the swift lean camels, </p>
<p>Long is the night you have been led, so dismount. </p>
<p>The people went forward until when they were on the borders of the <br/>
Balqa’ the Greek and Arab forces of Heraclius met them in a village called <br/>
Masharif. When the enemy approached, the Muslims withdrew to a village <br/>
called Mu’ta. There the forces met and the Muslims made their disposi¬ <br/>
tions, putting over the right wing Qutba b. Qatada of the B. 'Udhra, and <br/>
over the left wing an Ansar! called 'Ubaya b. Malik (786). </p>
<p>When fighting began Zayd b. Haritha fought holding the apostle’s stan¬ <br/>
dard, until he died from loss of blood among the spears of the enemy. Then <br/>
Ja'far took it and fought with it until when the battle hemmed him in he <br/>
jumped off his roan and hamstrung her and fought till he was killed. Ja'far <br/>
was the first man in Islam to hamstring his horse. </p>
<p>Yahya b. 'Abbad b. 'Abdullah b. al-Zubayr from his father who said, <br/>
‘My foster-father, who was of the B. Murra b. 'Auf, and was in the Mu’ta <br/>
raid said, “I seem to see Ja'far when he got off his sorrel and hamstrung <br/>
her and then fought until he was killed as he said: </p>
<p>Welcome Paradise so near, </p>
<p>Sweet and cool to drink its cheer. </p>
<p>Greeks will soon have much to fear </p>
<p>Infidels, of descent unclear </p>
<p>When we meet their necks I’ll shear.”’ (787) </p>
<p>795 Yahya b. 'Abbad on the same authority told me that when Ja'far was <br/>
killed 'Abdullah b. Rawaha took the standard and advanced with it riding <br/>
his horse. He had to put pressure on himself as he felt reluctant to go <br/>
forward. Then he said: </p>
<p>I swear, my soul, you shall come to the battle; </p>
<p>You shall fight or be made to fight. </p>
<p>Though men shout and scream aloud, </p>
<p>Why should you spurn Paradise ? </p>
<p>Long have you been at ease. </p>
<p>You are nothing but a drop in a worn-out skin! </p>
<p>He also said: </p>
<p>O soul, if you are not killed you will die. </p>
<p>This is the fate of death which you suffer. 1 </p>
<p>You have been given what you hoped for. </p>
<p>If you do what those two did you will have been guided aright— <br/>
meaning his two companions Zayd and Ja'far. Then he dismounted and a </p>
<p>1 There is a play on the words here. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 535 </p>
<p>cousin of his came up with a meat bone, saying, ‘Strengthen yourself with <br/>
this, for you have met in these battles of yours difficult days.’ He took it <br/>
and ate a little. Then he heard the sounds of confusion in the force and <br/>
threw it away, saying, ‘And you are still living ?’ He seized his sword and <br/>
died fighting. Then Thabit b. Aqram took the standard. He was brother <br/>
of B. al-'Ajlan. He called on the Muslims to rally round one man, and <br/>
when they wanted to rally to him he demurred and they rallied to Khalid <br/>
b. al-Walld. When he took the standard he tried to keep the enemy off and <br/>
to avoid an engagement. 1 Then he retreated and the enemy turned aside <br/>
from him until he got away with the men. </p>
<p>According to what I have been told, when the army was smitten the 796 <br/>
apostle said: ‘Zayd took the standard and fought with it until he was killed <br/>
as a martyr; then Ja'far took it and fought until he was killed as a martyr.’ </p>
<p>Then he was silent until the faces of the Ansar fell and they thought that <br/>
something disastrous had happened to 'Abdullah b. Rawaha. Then he said: <br/>
“Abdullah took it and fought by it until he was killed as a martyr. I saw in <br/>
a vision that they were carried up to me in Paradise upon beds of gold. I <br/>
saw 'Abdullah’s bed turning away from the beds of the other two, and <br/>
when I asked why, I was told that they had gone on but he hesitated before <br/>
he went forward.’ </p>
<p>(T. 'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr told me that when the news of Ja'far’s death T- 1617 <br/>
reached the apostle he said, ‘Ja'far went by yesterday with a company of <br/>
angels making for Btsha in the Yaman. He had two wings whose fore¬ <br/>
feathers were stained with blood.’) </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr from Umm 'Isa al-Khuza lya from Umm Ja'far <br/>
d. Muhammad b. Ja'far b. Abu Talib from her grandmother Asma’ d. </p>
<p>'Umays said: When Ja'far and his companions were killed, the apostle came <br/>
in to me when I had just tanned forty skins (788) and kneaded my dough <br/>
and washed and oiled and cleaned my children. He asked me to bring him <br/>
Ja'far’s sons and when I did so he smelt them and his eyes filled with tears. </p>
<p>I asked him whether he had heard bad news about Ja'far and his com¬ <br/>
panions, and he said that he had and that they had been killed that day. </p>
<p>I got up and cried aloud and the women gathered to me. The apostle <br/>
went out to his family saying, ‘Do not neglect Ja'far’s family so as not to <br/>
provide them with food, for they are occupied with the disaster that has <br/>
happened to their head.’ 2 </p>
<p>'Abdu’l-Rahman b. al-Qasim b. Muhammad told me from his father <br/>
from 'A’isha the prophet’s wife -who said: When news of Ja'far’s death <br/>
came we saw sorrow on the apostle’s face. A man w r ent to him and said, </p>
<p>‘The women trouble us and disturb us.’ He told him to go back and <br/>
quieten them. He w r ent but came back again saying the same words. </p>
<p>1 Some MSS. have ivakhdshd bihim ‘took precautions for their safety’, a reading which is <br/>
supported by 798. 10, and may well be right. </p>
<p>2 A reference to the practice of sending cooked food to a bereaved family to provide a <br/>
meal for the mourners and their visitors. </p>
<p>536 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>797 'A’isha here commented, ‘Meddling often injures the meddler.’ The <br/>
apostle said, ‘Go and tell them to be quiet, and if they refuse throw dust <br/>
in their mouths.’ 'A’isha added: ‘I said to myself, God curse you, for <br/>
you have neither spared yourself the indignity of a snub nor are you able <br/>
to do what the apostle said. I knew he could not throw dust in their <br/>
mouths.’ </p>
<p>Qutba b. Qatada al-'Udhri who was over the right wing had attacked <br/>
Malik b. Zafila (T, leader of the mixed Arabs) and killed him, and said: </p>
<p>I pierced Ibn Zafila b. al-Irash with a spear <br/>
Which went through him and then broke. </p>
<p>I gave his neck a blow </p>
<p>So that he bent like a bough of mimosa. </p>
<p>We led off the wives of his cousins <br/>
On the day of Raquqayn as sheep (789). </p>
<p>A kahina of Hadas who heard about the advance of the apostle’s army <br/>
had said to her people who were a clan called B. Ghanm: </p>
<p>I warn you of a proud people <br/>
Who are hostile in their gaze. </p>
<p>They lead their horses in single file <br/>
And shed turgid blood. </p>
<p>They took heed to her words and separated themselves from Lakhm, <br/>
Afterwards Hadas remained a large and prosperous tribe. Those who <br/>
took part in the war that day, the B. Tha'Iaba a clan of Hadas, remained <br/>
insignificant. When Khalid went off with the men he took the homeward <br/>
road. </p>
<p>Muhammad b. Ja'far b. al-Zubayr told me from 'Urwa b. al-Zubayr </p>
<p>798 that when they got near Medina the apostle and the Muslims met them <br/>
and the boys came running while the apostle came with the people on his <br/>
beast. He said, ‘Take the boys and carry them and give me Ja'far’s son.’ <br/>
They gave him 'Abdullah and he took him and carried him in front of him. <br/>
The men began to throw dirt at the army, saying, ‘You runaways, you fled <br/>
in the way of God!’ The apostle said, ‘They are not runaways but come- <br/>
agains if God will.’ </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr told me from 'Amir b. 'Abdullah b. al-Zubayr <br/>
from one of the family of al-Harith b. Hisham who were his maternal <br/>
uncles, from Umm Salama the prophet’s wife who said to the wife of <br/>
Salama b. Hisham b. al-'As b. al-Mughira, ‘Why is it that I do not see <br/>
Salama at prayers "with the apostle with the rest of the Muslims?’ She <br/>
replied, ‘By God, he can’t go out. Whenever he goes out the men call out <br/>
“Runaway! You ran away when in the path of God!” until he has taken <br/>
to sitting in his house and not going out at all.’ </p>
<p>Qays b. al-Musahhar al-Ya'muri composed the following verses in <br/>
which he made excuses for what he and the other men did that day and </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 537 </p>
<p>shows how Khalid took precautions for their safety and got away with <br/>
them: </p>
<p>By God, I never cease to blame myself for stopping <br/>
When the horses were leaping forward 1 with bolting eyes. </p>
<p>I stopped there neither asking help nor acting decisively <br/>
Nor protecting those for whom death was decreed. </p>
<p>However, I did but imitate Khalid <br/>
And Khalid has no equal in the army. </p>
<p>My heart was moved for Ja'far in Mu’ta <br/>
When an arrow was no good to an archer. </p>
<p>And he linked up their two wings to us <br/>
Muhajirs not polytheists nor unarmed. </p>
<p>Thus Qays made clear in his verses the facts which people dispute, namely <br/>
that the army kept their distance and were afraid of death, and established <br/>
the fact that Khalid and his men avoided battle (790). </p>
<p>Among the lamentations over the apostle’s companions who died at 799 <br/>
Mu’ta are the lines of Hassan b. Thabit: </p>
<p>A miserable night I had in Yathrib, </p>
<p>Anxiety that robbed me of sleep when others slept soundly. </p>
<p>At the thought of a friend my tears ran fast. </p>
<p>(Memory is oft the cause of weeping. </p>
<p>Nay, the loss of a friend is a calamity, </p>
<p>And how many a noble soul is afflicted and endures patiently.) </p>
<p>I saw the best of the believers follow one another to death, </p>
<p>Though some held back behind them. 2 </p>
<p>May God receive the slain at Mu’ta who went one after another. </p>
<p>Among them Ja'far now borne on wings, </p>
<p>And Zayd and 'Abdullah when they too followed <br/>
When the cords of death were active <br/>
On the day they wenron with the believers, </p>
<p>The fortunate radiant one leading them to death. </p>
<p>Bright as the full moon—of Hashim’s sons, </p>
<p>Haughty against wrong, daringly bold, </p>
<p>He fought till he fell unpillowed </p>
<p>On the battlefield, a broken shaft in his body. </p>
<p>He has his reward with the martyrs, </p>
<p>Gardens and green spreading trees. </p>
<p>We saw in Ja'far a man loyal to Muhammad, </p>
<p>One who gave decisive orders. </p>
<p>May there ever be in Islam of Hashim’s line <br/>
Pillars of strength and an endless source of pride; </p>
<p>1 The readings vary: qaia leaping; naia lifting up their heads; qabi'a panting. </p>
<p>1 This is banal. The Diwan (xxi) 'for I had been kept back with those who were left <br/>
behind’ is better. </p>
<p>538 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>In Islam they are a mountain and the people round them <br/>
Are rocks piled up to a mount majestic and lofty. </p>
<p>Splendid leaders: of them Ja'far and his brother 'All <br/>
And of them Ahmad the chosen one. </p>
<p>And Hamza and al-'Abbas and 'Aqil <br/>
And the sap of the wood from which he was squeezed. 1 <br/>
By them relief comes in every hard dusty fight <br/>
Whenever men are in a tight corner. </p>
<p>They are the friends of God Who sent down His wisdom to them <br/>
And among them is the purified bringer of the Book. 2 </p>
<p>Ka'b b. Malik said: </p>
<p>Wfflile the eyes of others slept my eye shed tears <br/>
Like the dripping of a faulty water-skin. </p>
<p>800 In the night when sorrows came upon me </p>
<p>When I was not sobbing 3 I turned restlessly on my couch. </p>
<p>Grief came repeatedly and I passed the night <br/>
As though I had to shepherd Ursa and Pisces. 4 <br/>
’Twas as though between my ribs and bowels <br/>
A burning piercing pain afflicted me, </p>
<p>Sorrowing for those who one after another <br/>
Were left lying that day in Mu’ta. </p>
<p>God bless them, the heroes, </p>
<p>And may plenteous rains refresh their bones! </p>
<p>They forced themselves for God’s sake <br/>
To ignore the fear of death and cowardly failure. </p>
<p>They went in front of the Muslims <br/>
Like stallion foals, clad in long mail <br/>
When they were led by Ja'far and his flag <br/>
In front of their leader, and what a fine leader. </p>
<p>Until the ranks were breached and Ja'far <br/>
Where the ranks were trapped lay prostrate. </p>
<p>The moon lost its radiance at his death, </p>
<p>The sun eclipsed and wellnigh dark. </p>
<p>A chief of high lineage from Hashim, </p>
<p>In lofty eminence and authority immovable, </p>
<p>A people by whom God protected His servants, </p>
<p>To them was sent down the revealed book. </p>
<p>They excelled other tribes in glory and honour </p>
<p>And their enlightened minds covered up the ignorance of others. </p>
<p>They would not embark on a vicious enterprise, </p>
<p>You could see their speaker deciding justly. </p>
<p>1 In popular language: a chip of the old block. </p>
<p>2 All this reads like Alide propaganda. </p>
<p>3 Or, reading ahinnu ‘yearning’ or ‘moaning’. </p>
<p>4 i.e. he watched the stars in their passage across the sky while others slept. A cliche. </p>
<p>539 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Their faces welcomed, their hands gave freely <br/>
When days of famine would excuse parsimony. </p>
<p>God was pleased with their guidance of His creation, </p>
<p>And by their good fortune the apostolic prophet was victorious. </p>
<p>Hassan b. Thabit mourning Ja'far: </p>
<p>I wept, and the death of Ja'far the prophet’s friend <br/>
Was grievous to the whole world. </p>
<p>I was distressed, and when I heard of your death said, </p>
<p>Who is for fighting by the flag Hawk and its shadow <br/>
With swords drawn from scabbards <br/>
Striking and lances piercing again and again ? </p>
<p>Now Ja'far, Fatima’s blessed son, is dead, 801 </p>
<p>The best of all creatures, most heavy is his loss, </p>
<p>Noblest of all in origin, and most powerful <br/>
When wronged, most submissive to right <br/>
When it was indubitably true; </p>
<p>Most open-handed, least in unseemliness; </p>
<p>Most lavish in generosity and kindness, </p>
<p>Always excepting Muhammad, </p>
<p>Whom no living being can equal. </p>
<p>Mourning Zayd b. Haritha and 'Abdullah b. Rawaha he said: </p>
<p>O eye, be generous with the last drop of thy tears <br/>
And remember in thy ease those in their graves. </p>
<p>Remember Mu’ta and what happened there <br/>
When they went to their defeat, </p>
<p>When they returned leaving Zayd there. </p>
<p>Happy be the abode of the poor one, imprisoned (in the grave), 1 <br/>
The friend of the best of all creatures, </p>
<p>The lord of men whose love fills their breasts. </p>
<p>Ahmad who has no equal, </p>
<p>My sorrow and my joy are for him. </p>
<p>Zayd’s position with us </p>
<p>Was not that of a man deceived. </p>
<p>Be generous with thy tears for the Khazrajite, 2 <br/>
He was a chief who gave freely there. </p>
<p>We have suffered enough by their death <br/>
And pass the night in joyless grief. </p>
<p>A Muslim poet who returned from Mu’ta said: </p>
<p>Enough cause for grief that I have returned while Ja'far <br/>
And Zayd and 'Abdullah are in the dust of the grave! </p>

<p>THE CAUSES THAT LED TO THE OCCUPATION OF <br/>
MECCA, A.H. 8 </p>
<p>After he had sent his force to Mu’ta the apostle stayed in Medina during <br/>
the latter Jumada and Rajab. Then the B. Bakr b. 'Abdu Manat b. Kinana <br/>
attacked Khuza'a while they were at a well of theirs in the lower region of <br/>
Mecca called al-Watir. The cause of the quarrel was that a man of B. <br/>
al-Hadrami called Malik b. 'Abbad—the HadramI being at that time allies <br/>
of al-Aswad b. Razn—had gone out on a trading journey; and when he <br/>
reached the middle of the Khuza'a country they attacked and killed him <br/>
and took his possessions. So B. Bakr attacked a man of Khuza'a and killed <br/>
him; and just before Islam Khuza'a attacked the sons of al-Aswad b. Razn <br/>
al-Dill who were the most prominent chiefs of B. Kinana—Salma, Kul- <br/>
thum, and Dhu’ayb—and killed them in 'Arafa at the boundary stones of <br/>
the sacred area. </p>
<p>803 One of the B. al-Dil told me that B. al-Aswad during the pagan era were <br/>
paid double bloodwit because of their position among them, while they <br/>
only got a single bloodwit. </p>
<p>While B. Bakr and Khuza'a were thus at enmity Islam intervened and <br/>
occupied men’s minds. When the peace of Hudaybiya was concluded <br/>
between the apostle and Quraysh one of the conditions—according to what <br/>
al-Zuhrl told me from 'tJrwa b. al-Zubayr from al-Miswar b. Makhrama <br/>
and Marvvan b. al-Hakam and other traditionists—was that anyone who <br/>
wanted to enter into a treaty relationship with either party could do so; the <br/>
B. Bakr joined Quraysh and Khuza'a joined the apostle. When the armis¬ <br/>
tice was established B. al-Dll of B. Bakr took advantage of it against <br/>
Khuza'a in their desire to revenge themselves on them for the sons of <br/>
Aswad whom they had killed. So Naufal b. Mu'awiya al-Dill, who was <br/>
their leader at the time, went out with the B. al-Dil, though all the B. Bakr <br/>
did not follow him, and attacked Khuza'a by night while they were at al- </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 541 </p>
<p>Watir their well, killing one of their men. Both parties fell back and con¬ <br/>
tinued the fight. Quraysh helped B. Bakr with weapons and some of them <br/>
fought with them secretly under cover of the night until they drove Khu¬ <br/>
za'a into the sacred area. When they reached it the B. Bakr said, ‘O <br/>
Naufal, we are in the sacred area. Remember your God, remember your <br/>
God!’ He replied in blasphemous words that he had no god that day. <br/>
‘Take your revenge, ye sons of Bakr. By my life, if you used to steal in the <br/>
sacred area, won’t you take vengeance in it?’ Now on the night they <br/>
attacked .them in al-Watir they killed a man called Munabbih who had <br/>
gone out with one of his tribesmen called Tamlm b. Asad. Munabbih had <br/>
a weak heart and he told Tamlm to escape for he was as good as dead <br/>
whether they killed him or let him go, for his heart had given out. So <br/>
Tamlm made off and escaped and Munabbih was overtaken and killed. <br/>
When Khuza'a entered Mecca they took refuge in the house of Budayl b. <br/>
Warqa’ and the house of a freed slave of theirs called Rafi'. </p>
<p>Tamlm in excusing himself for running away from Munabbih said: 804 </p>
<p>When I saw the B. Nufatha had advanced <br/>
Covering every plain and hill, </p>
<p>Rock and upland, no one else in sight, </p>
<p>Leading their swift wide-nostrilled horses </p>
<p>And I remembered the old blood feud between us, </p>
<p>A legacy of years gone by; </p>
<p>And I smelt the odour of death coming from them <br/>
And feared the stroke of a sharp sword <br/>
And knew that they would leave him they smote <br/>
Meat for mother lions and carrion for crows, </p>
<p>I set my feet firmly not fearing stumbling <br/>
And threw my garments on the bare ground. </p>
<p>I ran—no wild ass strong, lean-flanked, ran as I ran. </p>
<p>She may blame me, but had she been there </p>
<p>Her disapproval would have been urine wetting her. </p>
<p>Men well know that I did not leave Munabbih willingly. </p>
<p>Ask my companions (if you do not believe me) (792). </p>
<p>Al-Akhzar b. Lu't al-Dlli describing the fight between Kinana and <br/>
Khuza'a said: </p>
<p>Have not the most distant Ahabish 1 heard </p>
<p>That we repulsed B. Ka'b in impotent disgrace? 2 </p>
<p>We made them keep to the dwelling of the slave Rafi' </p>
<p>And they were confined helpless with Budayl <br/>
In the house of a low person who accepts humiliation <br/>
After we had slaked our vengeance on them with the sword. </p>
<p>We held them there for many a day </p>
<p>1 Possibly the Abyssinians are meant. </p>
<p>2 ‘with arrows snapped off near the feathered end*. </p>
<p>54 2 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Until from every pass we charged down on them. </p>
<p>We slaughtered them like goats, </p>
<p>We were like lions racing to get our teeth in them. </p>
<p>They had wronged us and behaved as enemies <br/>
And were the first to shed blood at the sacred boundary. ^ </p>
<p>80s When they pursued them with their vanguard in the wadi s bend <br/>
They were like young ostriches in full flight. </p>
<p>Budayl b. 'Abdu Manat b. Salama b. 'Amr b. al-Ajabb who was called <br/>
Budayl b. Umm As ram answered him thus: </p>
<p>Mav those people lose one another who boast </p>
<p>Since we left them no chief to call them to assembly save Nafl . </p>
<p>Was it for fear of a people you scorn </p>
<p>That you went past al-Watir fearful, never to return. </p>
<p>Every day we give to others to pay bloodwit for those they have killed <br/>
While we take no help in paying our bloodwit. </p>
<p>We came to your home in al-Tala a, </p>
<p>Our swords silenced all complaints. </p>
<p>From Bayd and 'Itwad 3 to the slopes of Radwa <br/>
We held off the attacks of horsemen. </p>
<p>On the day of al-Ghamlm 4 Ubays ran away. </p>
<p>We terrified him with a doughty leader. , </p>
<p>Was it because the mother of one of you defecated in her house in er </p>
<p>trepidation . , </p>
<p>While you were leaping about that we met no opposition. </p>
<p>By God’s house you lie, you did not fight <br/>
But w'e left you in utter confusion (793). </p>
<p>When Quraysh and B. Bakr had combined against Khuza'a and killed <br/>
some of them, thereby breaking their covenanted word with the apostle in <br/>
violating Khuza'a who were in treaty with him 'Amr b. Salim al-Khuzai <br/>
of the clan of B. Ka'b went to the apostle in Medina. (This led to the <br/>
8o 6 conquest of Mecca.) He stood by him as he was sitting among the men in <br/>
the mosque and said: </p>
<p>O Lord, I come to remind Muhammad <br/>
Of the old alliance between our fathers. </p>
<p>You are sons for whom we provided the mother, </p>
<p>Then w r e made peace 5 and have not changed our minds. </p>
<p>« Fathur is a place in Najd as A.Dh. says; but unless the action referred t° occurred <br/>

<p>Help us, now God guide you, </p>
<p>And call God’s servants to our aid. </p>
<p>Among them the apostle of God prepared for w ? ar. z <br/>
When he is W’ronged his face becomes black with anger <br/>
With a great army foaming like the sea. </p>
<p>Yerily Quraysh have broken their promise to you, </p>
<p>They have violated their pledged w&gt;ord, </p>
<p>And they set men to watch out for me in Kada. 1 <br/>
They claim that I can get no one to help us <br/>
And they but a miserable few. </p>
<p>They attacked us at night in al-Watir <br/>
And killed us as we performed the ritual prayers (794). </p>
<p>The apostle said, 'May you be helped O 'Amr b. Salim!’ 3 Then as a <br/>
cloud appeared in the sky he said, ‘This cloud will provide help for the B. <br/>
Ka'b.’ </p>
<p>Then Budayl b. Warqa’ came with a number of Khuza'a to the apostle <br/>
in Medina and told him of their misfortune and how Quraysh had helped <br/>
B. Bakr against them. Having done so they returned to Mecca. The <br/>
apostle said, ‘I think you will see Abu Sufyan coming to strengthen the <br/>
agreement and to ask for more time.’ When Budayl and his companions <br/>
had got as far as 'Usfan 4 they met Abu Sufyan who had been sent by <br/>
Quraysh to strengthen the agreement with the apostle and to ask for an <br/>
extension, for they were afraid of the consequences of what they had done. </p>
<p>Abu Sufyan asked Budayl whence he had come because he suspected him 807 <br/>
of having visited the apostle. He replied that he had come along the shore <br/>
and the bottom of this valley with the Khuza'a, and denied that he had <br/>
been to Muhammad. When Budayl had gone off to Mecca Abu Sufyan <br/>
said, 'If Budayl came to Medina he will have given his camels dates to eat <br/>
there,’ so he went to where the camels had knelt and split up their dung <br/>
and looked at the stones. 'By God, I swear Budayl has come from Muham¬ <br/>
mad,’ he said. </p>
<p>Having arrived at Medina he went in to his daughter Umm Habiba, and <br/>
as he went to sit on the apostle’s carpet she folded it up so that he could not <br/>
sit on it. ‘My dear daughter,’ he said, ‘I hardly know if you think that the <br/>
carpet is too good for me or that I am too good for the carpet!’ She replied: </p>
<p>‘It is the apostle’s carpet and you are an unclean polytheist. I do not want <br/>
you to sit on the apostle’s carpet.’ ‘By God,’ he said, ‘since you left me you <br/>
have gone to the bad.’ Then he went to the apostle, who would not speak <br/>
to him; he then went to Abu Bakr and asked him to speak to the apostle <br/>
for him; he refused to do so. Then he went to 'Umar who said, ‘Should I <br/>
intercede for you with the apostle! If I had only an ant I would fight you <br/>
with it.* Then he went in to see 'All with whom was Fatima the apostle’s </p>
<p>1 Or, reading taharrada, ‘enraged’. 2 A place on the heights above Mecca. </p>
<p>3 Or perhaps nusirta here means ‘You shall be helped’. </p>
<p>4 Two days’journey on the road from Mecca to Medina. </p>
<p>544 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>daughter who had with her 'All’s little son Hasan crawling in front of her. <br/>
He appealed to 'All on the ground of their close relationship to intercede <br/>
with the apostle so that he would not have to return disappointed; but he <br/>
answered that if the apostle had determined on a thing it was useless for <br/>
anyone to talk to him about it; so he turned to Fatima and said, ‘O daughter <br/>
of Muhammad, will you let your little son here act as a protector between <br/>
men so that he may become lord of the Arabs for ever ?’ She replied that <br/>
her little boy was not old enough to undertake such a task and in any case </p>
<p>808 none could give protection against God’s apostle. He then asked for 'All’s <br/>
advice in the desperate situation. He said, ‘I do not see anything that can <br/>
really help you, but you are the chief of B. Kinana, so get up and grant <br/>
protection between men and then go back home.’ When he asked if he <br/>
thought that that w r ould do any good he replied that he did not, but that <br/>
he could see nothing else. Thereupon Abu Sufyan got up in the mosque <br/>
and said, ‘O men, I grant protection between men.’ He then mounted his <br/>
camel and rode off to Quraysh who asked for his news. He said that <br/>
Muhammad would not speak to him, that he got no good from Abu <br/>
Quhafa’s son, and that he found 'Umar an implacable enemy (795). He had <br/>
found 'All the most helpful and he had done what he recommended, though <br/>
he did not know r whether it would do any good. He told them what he had <br/>
done and when they asked whether Muhammad had endorsed his words, <br/>
he had to admit that he had not. They complained that 'All had made a <br/>
fool of him and that his pronouncement was valueless, and he said that he <br/>
could find nothing else to do or say. </p>
<p>The apostle ordered preparations to be made for a foray and Abu Bakr <br/>
came in to see his daughter 'A’isha as she was moving some of the apostle’s <br/>
equipment. He asked if the apostle had ordered her to get things ready, <br/>
and she said that he had, and that her father had better get ready also. She <br/>
told him that she did not know where the troops were going. Later the <br/>
apostle informed the men that he was going to Mecca and ordered them to <br/>
make careful preparations. He said, ‘O God, take eyes and ears 1 from <br/>
Quraysh so that w'e may take them by surprise in their land,’ and the men <br/>
got themselves ready. </p>
<p>Hassan b. Thabit, inciting the men and mentioning the killing of the <br/>
men of Khuza'a, said: </p>
<p>It pained me though I did not see in Mecca’s valley <br/>
The men of Banu Ka'b w r ith their heads cut off <br/>
By men w r ho had not drawn their swords <br/>
And the many dead who w'ere left unburied. 2 </p>
<p>809 Would that I knew r if my help w r ith its biting satire 3 <br/>
Would injure Suhayl b. 'Amr, and Safwan </p>
<p>1 i.c. reports from travellers and others who have seen the Muslims assembling. </p>
<p>2 He means that Quraysh were really responsible for the death of these men in the sacred <br/>
territory. This is implied in the v.l. in the Ditvdn which has qatld bi-haqqin. </p>
<p>3 Hassan was no fighter. He relied on his tongue to hurt the enemy. </p>

<p>Muhammad b. Ja'far b. al-Zubayr from 'Urwa b. al-Zubayr and another <br/>
of our traditionists said that w^hen the apostle decided to go to Mecca <br/>
Hatib b. Abu Balta'a wrote a letter to Quraysh telling them that the apostle <br/>
intended to come at them. He gave it to a woman whom Muhammad b. <br/>
Ja'far alleged was from Muzayna while my other informant said she was <br/>
Sara, a freed woman of one of the B. 'Abdu’l-Muttalib. He paid her some <br/>
money to carry it to Quraysh. She put the letter on her .head and then <br/>
plaited her locks over it and went off. The apostle received news from <br/>
heaven of Hatib’s action and sent 'All and al-Zubayr b, al-'Awnvam with <br/>
instructions to go after her. They overtook her in al-Khulayqa of B. Abu <br/>
Ahmad. They made her dismount and searched her baggage but found <br/>
nothing. 'All swore that the apostle could not be mistaken nor could they, <br/>
and that if she did not produce the letter they would strip her. When she <br/>
saw that he was in earnest she told him to turn aside, and then she let down <br/>
her locks and drew out the letter and gave it to him and he took it to the <br/>
apostle. The apostle summoned Hatib and asked him w r hat induced him <br/>
to act thus. He replied that he believed in God and His apostle and had 810 <br/>
never ceased to do so, but that he was not a man of standing among <br/>
Quraysh and he had a son and a family there and that he had to deal <br/>
prudently with them for their sakes. ‘Umar wanted to cut off his head as <br/>
a hypocrite but the apostle said, ‘How do you know, 'Umar; perhaps God <br/>
looked favourably on those who were at Badr and said, “Do as you please, <br/>
for I have forgiven you.” ’ Then God sent down concerning Hatib: ‘O you <br/>
who believe, choose not My enemies and yours as friends so as to show them <br/>
kindness’ as far as the words ‘You have a good example in Abraham and <br/>
those with him when they said to their people: We are quit of you and <br/>
what you worship beside God; we renounce you and between us and you <br/>
enmity and hatred will ever endure until you believe in God alone.’ 2 </p>
<p>Muhammad b. Muslim b. Shihab al-Zuhri from 'Ubaydullah b. 'Abdul¬ <br/>
lah b. 'Utba b. Mas'ud from 'Abdullah b. 'Abbas told me: Then the apostle <br/>
went on his journey and put over Medina Abu Ruhm Kulthum b. Husayn <br/>
b. 'Utba b. Khalaf al-Ghifarl. He went out on the 10th of Ramadan and <br/>
he and the army fasted until when he reached al-Kudayd between 'Usfan <br/>
and Amaj he broke his fast. He went on until he came to Marr al-Zahran <br/>
with 10,000 Muslims; Sulaym numbered 700 and some say 1,000; and <br/>
Muzayna 1,000; and in every tribe there was a considerable number and <br/>
Islam. The Muhajirs and Helpers went as one man; not one stayed behind. </p>

<p>When the apostle had reached Marr al-Zahran Quraysh were completely <br/>
ignorant of the fact and did not even know what he was doing. On those <br/>
nights Abu Sufyan b. Harb and Hakim b. Hizam and Budayl b Warqa <br/>
went out searching for news by eye or ear when al-'Abbas had met the </p>
<p>apostle in the way (797}. - </p>
<p>Abu Sufyan b. al-Harith b. 'Abdu’l-Muttalib and Abdullah b. Abu <br/>
Umayya b. al-Mughira had met the apostle also in Nlqu’I- Uqab between <br/>
Mecca and Medina and tried to get in to him. Umm Salama spoke to <br/>
him about them, calling them his cousin and his brother-in-law. He <br/>
replied: ‘I have no use for them. As for my cousin he has wounded my <br/>
pride; and as for my aunt’s son and my brother-in-law he spoke,insultingly <br/>
of me in Mecca.’ When this was conveyed to them Abu Sufyan who had <br/>
his little son with him said, ‘By God, he must let me in or I will take this <br/>
little boy of mine and we will wander through the land until we die of <br/>
hunger and thirst.’ When he heard this the apostle felt sorry for them and <br/>
let them come in and they accepted Islam. Abu Sufyan recited the o ow¬ <br/>
ing verses about his Islam in which he* excused himself for what had gone </p>
<p>before: </p>
<p>By thy life when I carried a banner </p>
<p>To give al-Lat’s cavalry the victory over Muhammad </p>
<p>I was like one going astray in the darkness of the night, </p>
<p>But now I am led on the right track. </p>
<p>I could not guide myself, and he who with God overcame me <br/>
Was he whom I had driven away with all my might. </p>
<p>I used to do all I could to keep men from Muhammad <br/>
And I was called a relative of his, though I did not claim the relation. <br/>
They are what they are. He who does not hold with them <br/>
Though he be a man of sense is blamed and given the lie. </p>
<p>812 I wanted to be on good terms with them (Muslims) </p>
<p>But I could not join them while I was not guided. </p>
<p>Say to Thaqlf I do not want to fight them; </p>
<p>Say, too, ‘Threaten somebody else!’ </p>
<p>I was not in the army that attacked 'Amir, </p>
<p>I had no part with hand or tongue. </p>
<p>’Tw'as tribes that came from a distant land, </p>
<p>Strangers from Saham and Surdad (798)• </p>
<p>They allege that when he recited his words ‘He who with God overcame <br/>
me was he whom I had driven away with all my might’ the apostle <br/>
punched him in the chest and said, ‘You did indeed!’ </p>
<p>When the apostle camped at Marr al-Zahran 'Abbas said , 1 'Alas, Qur- <br/>
aysh, if the apostle enters Mecca by force before they come and ask for <br/>
protection that will be the end of Quraysh for ever.’ I sat upon the apostle s </p>
<p>1 T. 1630 f. following Yunus’s version of 1 . 1 . has a slightly longer text. Only significant <br/>
differences will be noted. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 547 </p>
<p>white mule and went out on it until I came to the arak trees, thinking that <br/>
I might find some woodcutters or milkers or someone who could go to <br/>
Mecca and tell them where the apostle was so that they could come out <br/>
and ask for safety before he entered the town by assault. As I was going <br/>
along with this intent suddenly I heard the sound of Abu Sufyan (T. and <br/>
Hakim b. Hazam) and Budayl talking together. Abu Sufyan was saying, </p>
<p>‘I have never seen such fires and such a camp before.’ Budayl w r as saying, <br/>
‘These, by God, are (the fires of) Khuza'a which war has kindled.’ Abu <br/>
Sufyan was saying, ‘Khuza'a are too poor and few to have fires and camps <br/>
like these.’ I recognized his voice and called to him and he recognized my <br/>
voice. I told him that the apostle was here with his army and expressed 813 <br/>
concern for him and for Quraysh: ‘If he takes you he will behead you, so <br/>
ride on the back of this mule so that I can take you to him and ask for you <br/>
his protection.’ So he rode behind me and his two companions returned. <br/>
Whenever we passed a Muslim fire we were challenged, and when they <br/>
saw the apostle’s mule with me riding it they said it was the prophet’s uncle <br/>
riding his mule until I passed by 'Umar’s fire. He challenged me and got <br/>
up and came to me, and when he saw Abu Sufyan on the back of the beast <br/>
he cried: ‘Abu Sufyan, the enemy of God! Thanks be to God who has <br/>
delivered you up without agreement or w<em>ord.’ Then he ran towards the <br/>
apostle and I made the mule gallop, and the mule won by the distance a <br/>
slow beast will outrun a slow man. I dismounted and went in to the <br/>
apostle and 'Umar came in saying the same words and adding, ‘Let me <br/>
take off his head.’ I told the apostle that I had promised him my protec¬ <br/>
tion; then I sat by him and took hold of his head and said, ‘By God, none <br/>
shall talk confidentially to him this night without my being present’; and <br/>
when 'Umar continued to remonstrate I said, ‘Gently, 'Umar! If he had <br/>
been one of the B. 'Adly b, Ka'b you would not have said this; but you <br/>
know that he is one of the B. 'Abdu Manaf.’ He replied,. ‘Gently, 'Abbas! <br/>
for by God your Islam the day you accepted it w</em>as dearer to me than the <br/>
Islam of al-Khattab would have been had he become a Muslim. One thing <br/>
I surely know is that your Islam was dearer to the apostle than my father’s <br/>
would have been.’ The apostle told me to take him away to my quarters <br/>
and bring him back in the morning. He stayed the night with me and I took <br/>
him in to see the apostle early in the morning and when he saw* him he <br/>
said, ‘Isn’t it time that you should recognize that there is no God but <br/>
Allah ?’ He answered, ‘You are dearer to me than father and mother. How <br/>
great is your clemency, honour, and kindness! By God, I thought that had <br/>
there been another God with God he would have continued to help me.’ </p>
<p>He said: ‘Woe to you, Abu Sufyan, isn’t it time that you recognize that I 814 <br/>
am God’s apostle?’ He answered, ‘As to that I still have some doubt.’ </p>
<p>I said to him, ‘Submit and testify that there is no God but Allah and that <br/>
Muhammad is the apostle of God before you lose your head,’ so he did so. </p>
<p>I pointed out to the apostle that Abu Sufyan was a man who liked to have <br/>
some cause for pride and asked him to do something for him. He said, ‘He </p>
<p>548 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>who enters Abu Sufyan’s house is safe, and he who locks his door is safe, and <br/>
he who enters the mosque is safe.’ When he went off to go back the apostle <br/>
told me to detain him in the narrow part of the wadi where the mountain <br/>
projected 1 so that God’s armies would pass by and he would see them; so <br/>
I went and detained him where the prophet had ordered. </p>
<p>The squadrons passed him with their standards, and he asked who they <br/>
were. When I said Sulaym he would say, ‘What have I to do with Sulaym?’ <br/>
and so with Muzayna until all had passed, he asking the same question and <br/>
making the same response to the reply. Finally the apostle passed with his <br/>
greenish-black squadron (799) io which were Muhajirs and Ansar whose </p>
<p>815 eyes alone were visible because of their armour. He said, Good heavens, <br/>
'Abbas, who are these ?’ and when I told him he said that none could with¬ <br/>
stand them. ‘By God, O Abu Fadl, the authority of your brother’s son has <br/>
become great.’ I told him that it was due to his prophetic office, and he <br/>
said that in that case he had nothing to say against it. </p>
<p>I told him to hurry to his people. When he came to them he cried at the <br/>
top of his voice: ‘O Quraysh, this is Muhammad who has come to you with <br/>
a force you cannot resist. He who enters Abu Sufyan s house is safe. <br/>
Hind d. 'Utba went up to him, and seizing his moustaches cried, ‘Kill this <br/>
fat greasy bladder of lard! What a rotten protector of the people!’ He <br/>
said, ‘Woe to you, don’t let this woman deceive you, for you cannot resist <br/>
what has come. He who enters Abu Sufyan’s house will be safe.’ ‘God <br/>
slay you,’ they said, ‘what good will your house be to us ?’ 2 He added, ‘And <br/>
he who shuts his door upon himself will be safe and he who enters the <br/>
mosque will be safe.’ Thereupon the people dispersed to their houses and <br/>
the mosque. </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr told me that when the apostle came to Dhu Tuwa <br/>
he halted on his beast turbaned with a piece of red YamanI cloth and that <br/>
he lowered his head in submission to God, when he saw how God had <br/>
honoured him with victory, so that his beard almost touched the middle of <br/>
the saddle. </p>
<p>Yahya b. 'Abbad b. 'Abdullah b. al-Zubayr from his father from his <br/>
grandmother Asma’d. Abu Bakr said: When the apostle stopped in Dhu <br/>
Tuwa Abu Quhafa said to a daughter of his, one of his youngest children, <br/>
‘Take me up to Abu Qubays,’ for his sight had almost gone. When they <br/>
got there he asked her what she could see and she told him ‘a mass of <br/>
black.’ ‘Those are the horses,’ he said. Then she told him that she could <br/>
see a man running up and down in front of them and he said that that was <br/>
the adjutant, meaning the man who carries and transmits the orders to the </p>
<p>816 cavalry. Then she said, ‘By God, the black mass has spread.’ He said, ‘In <br/>
that case the cavalry have been released, so bring me quickly to my house. <br/>
She took him down and the cavalry encountered him before he could get <br/>
to his house. The girl had a silver necklace and a man who met her tore </p>
<p>1 IJt. ‘at the nose of the mountain’. </p>
<p>2 i.e. it could not provide cover for them all. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 549 </p>
<p>it from her neck. When the apostle came in and entered the mosque Abu <br/>
Bakr came leading his father. On seeing him the apostle said, ‘Why did <br/>
you not leave the old man in his house so that I could come to him there ?’ <br/>
Abu Bakr replied that it was more fitting that he should come to him than <br/>
vice versa. He made him sit before him and stroked his chest and asked <br/>
him to accept Islam and he did so. When Abu Bakr brought his father in <br/>
his head was as white as edelweiss, and the apostle told them to dye it. <br/>
Then Abu Bakr got up and taking his sister’s hand said, ‘I ask in the name <br/>
of God and Islam for my sister’s necklace’ and none answered him, and he <br/>
said, ‘Sister, regard your necklace as taken by God (and look to Him to <br/>
requite you) for there is not much honesty among people nowadays.’ </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. Abu Najih told me that the apostle divided his force at <br/>
Dhu Tuwa ordering al-Zubayr b. al-'Awwam to go in with some of the <br/>
men from Kuda. Al-Zubayr commanded the left wing; Sa'd b. 'Ubada he <br/>
ordered to go in with some of the men from Kada’. </p>
<p>Some traditionists allege that when Sa'd started off he said, </p>
<p>Today is a day of war, </p>
<p>Sanctuary is no more, </p>
<p>and one of the muhajirs (800) heard him and told the apostle that it was to <br/>
be feared that he would resort to violence. The apostle ordered 'All to go <br/>
after him and take the flag from him and enter with it himself. </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. Abu Najih in his story told me that the apostle ordered 81 <br/>
Khalid to enter from al-Lit, the lower part of Mecca, with some men. Kha- <br/>
fid was in command of the right wing with Aslam, Sulaym, Ghifar, Muz¬ <br/>
ayna, Juhayna, and other Arab tribes. Abu 'Ubayda b. al-Jarrah advanced <br/>
with the troops pouring into Mecca in front of the apostle who entered <br/>
from Adhakhir 1 until he halted above Mecca and his tent was pitched <br/>
there. </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. Abu Najih and 'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr told me that Safwan <br/>
b. Umayya and Tkrima b. Abu Jahl and Suhayl b. 'Amr had collected <br/>
some men in al-Khandama 2 to fight. Himas b. Qays b. Khalid brother of <br/>
B. Bakr was sharpening his sword before the apostle entered Mecca, and <br/>
his wife asked him why he was doing so. When he told her it was for <br/>
Muhammad and his companions she said that she did not think that it <br/>
would do them any harm. He answered that he hoped to give her one of <br/>
them as a slave and said: </p>
<p>I have no excuse if today they advance. </p>
<p>Here is my weapon, a long-bladed lance, </p>
<p>A two-edged sword in their faces will dance! </p>
<p>Then he went to al-Khandama with Safwan, Suhayl, and Tkrima and <br/>
when the Muslims under Khalid arrived a skirmish followed in which </p>

<p>Kurz b. Jabir, one of the B. Muharib b. Fihr, and Khunays b. Khalid b. <br/>
Rabl'a b. Asram, an ally of B. Munqidh, who were in Khalid’s cavalry, <br/>
were killed. They had taken a road of their own apart from Khalid and <br/>
were killed together. Khunays was killed first and Kurz put him between <br/>
his feet and fought in his defence until he was slain, saying meanwhile: </p>
<p>Safra’ of the B. Fihr knows <br/>
The pure of face and heart </p>
<p>818 That I fight today in defence of Abu Sakhr. </p>
<p>Khunays was surnamed Abu Sakhr (8oi). </p>
<p>Salama b. al-Mayla’, one of Khalid’s horsemen, was killed, and the <br/>
polytheists lost about 12 or 13 men-; then they took to flight. Himas ran off <br/>
and went into his house and told his wife to bolt the door. When she asked <br/>
what had become of his former words he said: </p>
<p>If you had witnessed the battle of Khandama <br/>
When Safwan and Tkrima fled <br/>
And Abu Yazld was standing like a pillar 1 <br/>
And the Muslims met them with their swords <br/>
Which cut through arms and skulls, </p>
<p>Only confused cries being heard <br/>
Behind us their cries and groans, </p>
<p>You would not have uttered the least word of blame (802) </p>
<p>The apostle had instructed his commanders when they entered Mecca <br/>
only to fight those who resisted them, except a small number who were to <br/>
be killed even if they were found beneath the curtains of the Ka'ba. <br/>
Among them was ‘Abdullah b. Sa'd, brother of the B. ‘Amir b. Lu’ayy. <br/>
The reason he ordered him to be killed was that he had been a Muslim and <br/>
used to write down revelation; then he apostatized and returned to Quraysh <br/>
and fled to 'Uthman b. 'Affan whose foster-brother he was; The latter hid </p>
<p>819 him until he brought him to the apostle after the situation in Mecca was <br/>
tranquil, and asked that he might be granted immunity. They allege that <br/>
the apostle remained silent for a long time till finally he said yes. When <br/>
'Uthman had left he said to his companions who were sitting around him, <br/>
‘I kept silent so that one of you might get up and strike off his head!’ One <br/>
of the Ansar said, ‘Then why didn’t you give me a sign, O apostle of God ?’ <br/>
He answered that a prophet does not kill by pointing (803). </p>
<p>Another was 'Abdullah b. Khatal of B. Taym b. Ghalib. He had become <br/>
a Muslim and the apostle sent him to collect the poor tax in company with <br/>
one of the Ansar. He had with him a freed slave who served him, (He was <br/>
a Muslim.) When they halted he ordered the latter to kill a goat for him <br/>
and prepare some food, and went to sleep. When he woke up the man had </p>
<p>1 This explanation of mutima is based on S.’s statement that elsewhere 1 . 1 . says that <br/>
such is the meaning. The alternative ‘A widow left with fatherless children* is supported <br/>
by Azraq:, 47 kal'ajuzi'l-mu tima (quoted by Nttldeke, Glos. 103 and T.’s kal-matama). </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 551 </p>
<p>done nothing, so he attacked and killed him and apostatized. He had two <br/>
singing-girls Fartana and her friend who used to sing satirical songs about <br/>
the apostle, so he ordered that they should be killed with him. </p>
<p>Another was al-Huvvayrith b. Nuqaydh b. Wahb b. 'Abd b. Qusayy, one <br/>
of those who used to insult him in Mecca (804). </p>
<p>Another was Miqyas b. Hubaba 1 because he had killed an Ansar] who <br/>
had killed his brother accidentally, and returned to Quraysh as a polytheist. </p>
<p>And Sara, freed slave of one of the B. 'Abdu’l-Muttalib; and 'Ikrima b. </p>
<p>Abu Jahl. Sara had insulted him in Mecca. As for Tkrima, he fled to the <br/>
Yaman. His wife Umm Hakim d. al-Harith b. Hisham became a Muslim <br/>
and asked immunity for him and the apostle gave it. She went to the <br/>
Yaman in search of him and brought him to the apostle and he accepted <br/>
Islam. (T. Tkrima used to relate, according to what they say, that what T- 1640 <br/>
turned him to Islam when he had gone to the Yaman was that he had deter¬ <br/>
mined to cross the sea to Abyssinia and when he found a ship the master <br/>
said, ‘O servant of God, you cannot travel in my ship until you acknow¬ <br/>
ledge that God is one and disavow any rival to Him, for I fear that if you <br/>
do not do so we should perish.’ When I asked if none but such persons <br/>
was allowed to travel in his ship he replied, ‘Yes, and he must be sincere.’ </p>
<p>So I thought: Why should I leave Muhammad when this is what he has <br/>
brought us ? Truly our God on the sea is our God on the dry land. There¬ <br/>
upon I recognized Islam and it entered into my heart.) ‘Abdullah b. </p>
<p>Khatal was killed by Sa'id b. Hurayth al-Makhzuml and Abu Barza al- <br/>
Aslami acting together. Miqyas was killed by Numayla b. 'Abdullah, one 820 <br/>
of his own people. Miqyas’s sister said of his killing: </p>
<p>By my life, Numayla shamed his people </p>
<p>And distressed the winter guests w'hen he slew Miqyas. </p>
<p>Whoever has seen a man like Miqyas </p>
<p>Who provided food for young mothers in hard times. </p>
<p>As for Ibn Khatal’s two singing-girls,‘one was killed and the other ran <br/>
away until the apostle, asked for immunity, gave it her. Similarly Sara, <br/>
who lived until in the time of ‘Umar a mounted soldier trod her down in <br/>
the valley of Mecca and killed her. Al-Huwayrith was killed by ‘All. </p>
<p>Sa'id b. Abu Hind from Abu Murra, freed slave of‘Aqil b. Abu Talib, <br/>
told me that Umm Hani’d. Abu Talib said: When the apostle halted in the <br/>
upper part of Mecca two of my brothers-in-law f from B. Makhzum fled to <br/>
me. (She w^as the wife of Hubayra b. Abu Wahb al-Makhzuml.) ‘All came <br/>
in swearing that he w'ould kill them, so I bolted the door of my house on <br/>
them and went to the apostle and found him washing in a large bowl in <br/>
which w'as the remains of dough while his daughter Fatima was screening <br/>
him with his garment. When he had washed he took his garment and <br/>
wrapped himself in it and prayed eight bendings of the morning prayer. </p>

<p>Then he came forward and welcomed me and asked me why I had come. <br/>
When I told him about the two men and ‘All he said: ‘We give protec¬ <br/>
tion to whomsoever you give protection and we give safety to those you <br/>
protect. He must not kill them’ (805). </p>
<p>Muhammad b. Ja'far b. al-Zubayr from 'Ubaydullah b. 'Abdullah b. <br/>
Abu Thaur from Saflya d. Shayba told me that the apostle after arriving in <br/>
Mecca when the populace had settled down went to the temple and en¬ <br/>
compassed it seven times on his camel touching the black stone with a <br/>
821 stick which he had in his hand. This done he summoned ‘Uthman b. <br/>
Talha and took the key of the Ka'ba from him, and when the door was <br/>
opened for him he went in. There he found a dove made of wood. He <br/>
broke it in his hands and threw it away. Then he stood by the door of the <br/>
Ka'ba while the men in the mosque gathered to him, 1 <br/>
Azr. i. 70 [I.I. from 'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr from 'Ali b. 'Abdullah b. 'AbbSs: The </p>
<p>apostle entered Mecca on the day of the conquest and it contained 360 <br/>
idols which Iblls 2 had strengthened with lead. The apostle was standing <br/>
by them with a stick in his hand, saying, ‘The truth has come and false¬ <br/>
hood has passed away; verily falsehood is sure to pass away’ (Sura 17. 82). <br/>
Then he pointed at them with his stick and they collapsed on their backs <br/>
one after the other. </p>
<p>When the apostle prayed the noon prayer on the day of the conquest he <br/>
ordered that all the idols which were round the Ka'ba should be collected <br/>
and burned with fire and broken up. Fadala b. al-Mulawwih al-Laythi <br/>
said commemorating the day of the conquest: </p>
<p>Had you seen Muhammad and his troops </p>
<p>The day the idols were smashed when he entered, </p>
<p>You would have seen God’s light become manifest <br/>
And darkness covering the face of idolatry. </p>
<p>Azr. I.I. from Hakim b. 'Abbad b. Hanif and other traditionists : Quraysh <br/>
u 107 had put pictures in the Ka'ba including two of Jesus son of Mary and <br/>
Mary (on both of whom be peace!). I. Shihab said: Asma’d. Shaqr said <br/>
that a woman of Ghassan joined in the pilgrimage of the Arabs and when <br/>
she saw the picture of Mary in the Ka'ba she said, ‘My father and my <br/>
mother be your ransom! You are surely an Arab woman!’ The apostle <br/>
ordered that the pictures should be erased except those of Jesus and Mary. 3 ] </p>
<p>A traditionist 4 told me that the apostle stood at the door of the Ka'ba <br/>
and said: ‘There is no God but Allah alone; He has no associate. He has <br/>
made good His promise and helped His servant. He has put to flight the </p>
<p>1 Other explanations given for the word istakaffa are ‘fixed their gaze on’ and ‘sur¬ <br/>
rounded’. </p>
<p>1 A parallel tradition on the authority of I. 'Abbas via al-Zuhrl simply says that the idols <br/>
were strengthened by lead. </p>
<p>3 Apparently I.H. has cut out what I.I. wrote and adopted the later tradition that all the <br/>
pictures were obliterated. A more detailed account of these pictures will be found in Azr. <br/>

<p>confederates alone. Every claim of privilege 1 or blood or property are <br/>
abolished by me except the custody of the temple and the watering of the <br/>
pilgrims. The unintentionally slain in a quasi-intentional way by club or <br/>
whip, 2 for him the bloodwit is most severe: a hundred camels, forty of <br/>
them to be pregnant. O Quraysh, God has taken from you the haughtiness <br/>
of paganism and its veneration of ancestors. Man springs from Adam <br/>
and Adam sprang from dust.’ Then he read to them this verse: ‘O men, </p>
<p>We created you from male and female and made you into peoples and <br/>
tribes that you may know one another: of a truth the most noble of you in <br/>
God’s sight is the most pious’ to the end of the passage. 3 Then he added, </p>
<p>‘O Quraysh, what do you think that I am about to do with you?’ They <br/>
replied, ‘Good. You are a noble brother, son of a noble brother.’ He <br/>
said, ‘Go your way for you are the freed ones.’ </p>
<p>[T. Thus the apostle let them go though God had given him power over T* 1642 <br/>
their lives and they were his spoil. For this reason the Meccans were <br/>
called ‘the freed ones’. Then the populace gathered together in Mecca <br/>
to do homage to the apostle in Islam. As I have heard, he sat (waiting) <br/>
for them on al-Safa while ‘Umar remained below him imposing condi¬ <br/>
tions on the people who paid homage to the apostle promising to hear and <br/>
obey God and His apostle to the best of their ability. This applied to the <br/>
men; when they had finished he dealt with the women. Among the <br/>
Quraysh women who came was Hind d. 'Utba who came veiled and dis¬ <br/>
guised because of what she had done especially in regard to Hamza, for she <br/>
was afraid that the apostle would punish her. According to what I heard, <br/>
when they approached him he asked if they gave their word not to associate <br/>
anything with God, and Hind said, ‘By God, you lay on us something that <br/>
you have not laid on the men and we will carry it out.’ He said, ‘And you <br/>
shall not steal.’ She said, ‘By God, I used to take a little of Abu Sufyan’s <br/>
money and I do not know whether that is lawful for me or not.’ Abu <br/>
Sufyan who was present when she said this told her that so far as the past <br/>
was concerned it was lawful. The apostle said, ‘Then you are Hind d. </p>
<p>‘Utba?’ and she said ‘I am; forgive me what is past and God will forgive <br/>
you.’ He said, ‘And do not commit adultery.’ She answered, ‘Does a free <br/>
woman commit adultery, O apostle of God ?’ He said, ‘And you shall not <br/>
kill your children.’ She said, ‘I brought them up when they were little and <br/>
you killed them on the day of Badr when they were grown up, so you are <br/>
the one to know about them!’ 'Umar laughed immoderately at her reply. </p>
<p>He said,‘You shall not invent slanderous tales.’ She said, ‘By God, slander <br/>
is disgraceful, but it is sometimes better to ignore it.’ He said, ‘You shall <br/>
not disobey me in carrying out orders to do good,’ She said, ‘We should <br/>
not have sat all this time if we wanted to disobey you in such orders.’ The <br/>
apostle said to ‘Umar, ‘Accept,their troth,’ and he asked God’s forgiveness <br/>
for them while 'Umar accepted their homage on his behalf. The apostle <br/>
never used to take the women’s hands; he did not touch a woman nor did </p>
<p>1 Specially inherited authority. 1 i.e. manslaughter. 3 Sura 49. 13. </p>
<p>554 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>one touch him except one whom God had made law'ful to him or was one <br/>
of his harim. Ibn Ishaq from Abban b. Salih said that the women’s homage <br/>
according to what some traditionists had told him was in this wise: a vessel <br/>
containing water was put in front of the apostle and when he laid the <br/>
conditions upon them and they accepted them he plunged his hand into <br/>
the vessel and then withdrew it and the women did the same. Then after <br/>
that he would impose conditions on them and when they accepted them he <br/>
said, ‘Go, I have accepted your homage,’ and added nothing further.] 1 </p>
<p>Then the apostle sat in the mosque and ‘All came to him with the key of <br/>
the Ka'ba in his hand asking him to grant his family the right of guarding <br/>
the temple as w r ell as the watering of the pilgrims, but the apostle called for <br/>
'Uthman b. Talha and said, ‘Here is your key; today is a day of good <br/>
faith’ (806). </p>
<p>822 Sa'id b. Abu Sandar al-Aslaml from one of his tribesmen said: We had <br/>
with us a brave man called Ahmar Ba’san. 2 When he slept he snored so <br/>
loudly that everyone knew where he was. When he spent the night with <br/>
his clan he slept apart. If the clan was attacked at night they would call <br/>
his name and he would leap up like a lion and nothing could withstand <br/>
him. It happened that a party of raiders from Hudhayl came, making for <br/>
the people at their water; and W'hen they drew near Ibn al-Athwa' al- <br/>
Hudhali told them not to hurry him until he had looked round; for if <br/>
Ahmar was among the group there was no way to get at them. He snored <br/>
so loudly that one could tell where he was. So he listened and when he </p>
<p>823 heard his snoring he w r alked up to him and thrust his sw r ord into his breast <br/>
pressing on it so that he killed him. Then they rushed upon the party who <br/>
cried ‘AhmarI’ But they had no Ahmar. </p>
<p>On the morrow of the conquest of Mecca Ibn al-Athwa' came into <br/>
Mecca to look round and find out what the situation was. Now he was still <br/>
a polytheist, and Khuza'a saw' and recognized him, and they surrounded <br/>
him as he was at the side of one of the walls of Mecca, saying, ‘Are you the <br/>
man w'ho killed Ahmar?’ ‘Yes’, he said, ‘and what about it?’ Thereupon <br/>
Khirash b. Umayya advanced on him with drawn sword saying, ‘Get away <br/>
from the man.’ We supposed that he wanted to get the people away from <br/>
him; but when we drew' away he ran at him and thrust his sword in his <br/>
belly. By God, I can almost see him now with his entrails flowing forth <br/>
from his belly and his eyes two mere slits in his head the while he said, <br/>
‘Have you done it, you men of Khuza'a?’ until he collapsed and fell. The <br/>
apostle said, ‘Stop this killing, Khuza'a; there has been too much killing <br/>
even if there were profit in it. I will pay the bloodwit for the man you <br/>
have killed.’ </p>
<p>'Abdu’l-Rahman b. Harmala al-Aslaml from Sa'id b. al-Musayyib told <br/>
me that when the apostle heard w'hat Khirash had done he said, ‘Khirash is <br/>
too prone to kill,’ thereby rebuking him. </p>

<p>The Life of Muhammad 555 </p>
<p>Sa'id b. Abu Sa'id al-Maqburl from Abu Shurayh al-Khuza'I said: <br/>
When 'Amr b. al-Zubayr 1 came to Mecca to fight his brother 'Abdullah I <br/>
came to him and said, ‘Listen! When we were with the apostle the day <br/>
after the conquest of Mecca, Khuza'a attacked a man of Hudhayl and <br/>
killed him, he being a polytheist. The apostle arose and addressed us, <br/>
saying, “God made Mecca holy the day He created heaven and earth, and <br/>
it is the holy of holies until the resurrection day. It is not lawful for anyone <br/>
who believes in God and the last day to shed blood therein, nor to cut <br/>
down trees therein. It was not lawful to anyone before me and it will not <br/>
be lawful to anyone after me. Indeed, it is not lawful for me except at this 824 <br/>
time because of (God’s) anger against its people. Now it has regained its <br/>
former holiness. Let those here now tell those that are not here. If anyone <br/>
should say, The apostle killed men in Mecca, say God permitted His <br/>
apostle to do so but He does not permit you. Refrain from killing, you men <br/>
of Khuza'a, for there has been too much killing even if there were profit in <br/>
it. Since you have killed a man I will pay his bloodwit. If anyone is killed <br/>
after my sojourn here his people have a choice: they can have his killer’s life <br/>
or the blood-money.” Then the apostle paid the bloodwit for the man <br/>
whom Khuza'a had slain.* 'Amr replied, ‘Be off with you, old man! We <br/>
know more about its sanctity than you. It does not protect the shedder of <br/>
blood, nor the man who casts off his allegiance nor him who withholds tax. </p>
<p>Abu Shurayh answered, ‘I was there and you w'ere not. The apostle ordered <br/>
us who were present to tell those who were absent. I have told you and the <br/>
responsibility now rests with you’ (807). </p>
<p>Muhammad b. Ja'far from 'Urwa b. al-Zubayr told me that Safwan b. 825 <br/>
Umayya went out to Judda to take ship to the it aman. Umayr b. Wahb 826 <br/>
told the prophet that Safwan, who was a chief among his people, had fled <br/>
from him to cast himself into the sea, and asked him to grant him immu¬ <br/>
nity. The prophet agreed to do so, and 'Umayr asked him for a sign to <br/>
prove it, and he gave him the turban with which he had entered Mecca. <br/>
'Umayr took it and overtook Safwan just as he was about to embark. He <br/>
begged him not to commit suicide and produced the token of his safety. <br/>
Safwan told him to be off and not to speak to him. He replied, ‘My parents <br/>
be your ransom! He is the most virtuous, most pious, most clement, and <br/>
best of men, your very cousin. His honour is your honour.’ He replied, </p>
<p>‘I go in fear of my life because of him.’ He answered, ‘He is too clement <br/>
and too honourable to kill you.’ So he went back with him to the apostle <br/>
and told him that 'Umayr had said that he had promised him immunity. </p>
<p>He said that that was true. Safwan asked for two months in which to make <br/>
up his mind, and he gave him four months (808). </p>
<p>Al-Zuhrl told me that Umm Hakim d. al-Harith b. Hisham and Fakhita <br/>
d. al-Walid (w'ho was married to Safwan, while Umm Hakim’s husband </p>
<p>1 S. here points out that this is a mistake on the part of I.H. and that the man was 'Amr <br/>
b. Sa'id b. al-'A$ b. Umayya; that the mistake is due either to I.H. or to al-Bakka i; and <br/>
that the true tradition is given by Yunus. </p>
<p>556 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>was 'Ikrima b. Abu Jahl) had become Muslims. The latter asked immunity <br/>
for her husband and the apostle granted it and she joined him in the <br/>
Yaman and brought him back. When Tkrima and Safwan became Muslims <br/>
the apostle confirmed their first marriages. </p>
<p>Sa'Id b. Abdu’I-Rahman b. Hassan b. Thabit told me that Hassan <br/>
directed a single verse and no more at I. al-Ziba f ra who was in Najran at <br/>
the time: 1 </p>
<p>Do not be without a man, hatred of whom <br/>
Has made you live in Najran in utmost misery! </p>
<p>827 When this reached I. al-Ziba'ra he went to the apostle and accepted <br/>
Islam. Then he said: </p>
<p>O apostle of God, my tongue is repairing <br/>
The mischief I did when a perishing (sinner) </p>
<p>When I followed Satan in going astray. </p>
<p>(He who turns aside with him must perish.) </p>
<p>My flesh and my bones believe in my Lord. </p>
<p>My heart bears witness that you are the wamer. </p>
<p>I will drive the clan of Lu’ayy from you there, </p>
<p>All of them being deceived. </p>
<p>When he became a Muslim he said also: </p>
<p>Cares and anxieties withheld sleep from me <br/>
And night pitch black was agitated above me <br/>
Because I heard that Ahmad had blamed me; </p>
<p>I passed the night like a man with fever. </p>
<p>O best of those, a swift light-footed <br/>
Straight-running camel ever carried, </p>
<p>Forgive me for what I said and did <br/>
When I went wandering in error, </p>
<p>What time Sahm gave me most misleading orders, </p>
<p>And Makhzum did the same; </p>
<p>When I supported evil courses </p>
<p>Led by those who erred, whose way was ill omened. </p>
<p>Today my heart believes in the prophet Muhammad. </p>
<p>He who misses this is a loser. </p>
<p>Enmity has passed, its ties are ended; </p>
<p>Kinship and reason call us together. </p>
<p>Forgive my mistakes—my parents be thy ransom, </p>
<p>For you are compassionate having found mercy. </p>
<p>Upon you is the sign of God’s knowledge, </p>
<p>A light most bright and a seal imprinted. </p>
<p>1 The point is interesting because the Dttvan (H. cxlii) adds two more verses which fit the <br/>
context poorly. It looks almost as though Hassan’s grandson knew that they had been <br/>
grafted on to I^assan’s line and resented the impertinence. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 557 </p>
<p>After His love He gave you His proof to honour you <br/>
And God’s proof is great. </p>
<p>I testify that your religion is true <br/>
And that you are great among men. </p>
<p>And God testifies that Ahmad is the chosen, </p>
<p>The noble one, cynosure of the righteous, </p>
<p>A prince whose lofty house is from Hashim, </p>
<p>Strong from top to bottom (809). </p>
<p>As for Hubayra b. Abu Wahb al-Makhzumi, he lived there until he died 828 <br/>
an unbeliever. His wife was Umm Hani’d. Abu Talib whose name was <br/>
Hind. When he heard that she had become a Muslim he said: </p>
<p>Does Hind long for you or do you know that she has asked about you ? <br/>
Thus distance produces many changes. </p>
<p>On a high inaccessible fort in Najran she has banished my sleep. </p>
<p>When night falls her phantom roams abroad. </p>
<p>O that reproacher who wakes me at night and blames me! </p>
<p>She reproaches me by night—may her error err utterly! </p>
<p>Asserting that if I obey my familyj shall perish, </p>
<p>But will anything but the loss of her kill me ? </p>
<p>But I am of a people who if they do their utmost <br/>
They attain their end forthwith. </p>
<p>I protect the rear of my tribe </p>
<p>When they wheel beneath the spear points </p>
<p>And the swords in their hands become like </p>
<p>The sticks boys play with, no shade but the swords. 1 </p>
<p>I loathe the envious and their works: </p>
<p>God will provide food for myself and my family. </p>
<p>Words spoken without truth <br/>
Are like an arrow without a head. </p>
<p>If you have followed Muhammad’s religion <br/>
And the ties of kinship draw you to your kin, </p>
<p>Then stay far distant on a high round rock, </p>
<p>Dry dust its only moisture (810). 2 </p>
<p>The Muslims who were present at the conquest of Mecca numbered <br/>
10,000: of B. Sulaym 700 (some say 1,000); of B. Ghifar 400; of Aslam </p>
<p>400; of Muzayna 1,003; ^ the rest of them were fr ? m Ql J r * ysh j <br/>
the Ansar and their allies and parties of Arabs from Tamim and Qays and </p>
<p>Asad. </p>
<p>1 This line is an imitation of I. 41 in the Muallaqa of 'Amr b. Kulthum: </p>
<p>kaattna myufand minna tvaminhum <br/>
makha.rlqu.n bi'aydt la ibina . </p>
<p>Some lexicographers favour a rendering ‘knotted rags’. In either case the meaning is that <br/>
they regarded the swords as mere toys. </p>

<li>The poet apostrophizes himself. </li>
</ul>
<p>558 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Among the poems about the conquest is the following from Hassan b. <br/>
Thabit: </p>
<p>From Dhatu’l-Asabi' and al-Jiwa’ 1 to 'Adhra’ 2 </p>
<p>Traces have disappeared, their camping-ground is empty. </p>
<p>The camps of B. al-Hashas 3 are a desert <br/>
Obliterated by w r ind and rain. </p>
<p>829 There used always to be a friend there; </p>
<p>Its pastures held choice camels and sheep. </p>
<p>But leave that! Who will rid me of the night vision </p>
<p>Which keeps me from sleep when night's first hours have gone, </p>
<p>Of Sha'tha’ 4 who fills me with longing <br/>
So that my heart cannot be cured of it ? </p>
<p>She is like the wine of Bayt RaV <br/>
Mixed with honey and water.- <br/>
All draughts that could be mentioned <br/>
Cannot be compared with that wine. </p>
<p>We blame it for what we do amiss </p>
<p>If we are quarrelsome or insulting to others. </p>
<p>When we drink it we are as kings and lions, </p>
<p>Nothing can keep us from the fray. </p>
<p>May we lose our horses if you do not see them 6 <br/>
Raising the dust-clouds, their rendezvous Kadak <br/>
They tug at the reins turning their necks to one side, </p>
<p>The thirsty lances couched above their shoulders. </p>
<p>As our horses raced along, 7 </p>
<p>The women flapped their veils in their faces. </p>
<p>If you don't oppose us we shall celebrate the ‘Umra, </p>
<p>The conquest will be completed and the covering removed. </p>
<p>But if you do, expect a fight on the day <br/>
When God helps those He pleases. </p>
<p>Gabriel, God's messenger, is with us and <br/>
The holy spirit has no equal. </p>
<p>God said, ‘I have sent a man </p>
<p>Who speaks the truth if you will profit by experience. </p>
<p>1 These places are in Syria; the latter was the camp of al-Harith b. Abu Shamr the <br/>
Ghas 9 anid whom IJassan used to visit. </p>
<p>2 One post distant from Damascus. </p>
<p>3 A clan of B. Asad. </p>
<p>4 Who this woman was is not certain: some say she was d. Sallamb. Mishkam the Jew; <br/>
others say a woman of Khuza’a; others someone else. </p>
<p>5 A place in Jordan noted for its wine. </p>
<p>6 From this point the poem begins its theme. </p>
<p>7 Tamattara in this sense is supported by T. 1650,. 12.V. Gloss. ‘Rain-bespattered’, sug¬ <br/>
gested by A.Dh., gives a poor sense unless it is a poetical way of saying that the sides of the <br/>
horses were covered with foam. The Lisdn explains that the women flapped their veils to <br/>
hinder them. The reading in Diu'iin and in some MSS. yubarina’l-asinnata may be right: <br/>
‘they try to catch up with the points of the lances whose thirsty shafts were couched above <br/>
their shoulders’. The horses could see the lance tips on their right front. Cf. W. 707. 15. </p>
<p>559 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>I bear witness to him, so arise 1 confess him truthful.’ </p>
<p>But you said, ‘We will not and we do not wish to.’ </p>
<p>And God said, ‘ I have sent an army, </p>
<p>The Ansar accustomed to the fray.’ </p>
<p>Every day we get from Ma'add 2 <br/>
Cursing, battle, or lampooning. </p>
<p>We will repulse with verses those who lampoon us <br/>
And smite them when war breaks out. </p>
<p>Give Abu Sufyan a message from me, </p>
<p>For what was hidden has become clear, </p>
<p>Namely that our swords have left you a slave, </p>
<p>The heads of the 'Abdu’l-Dar mere bondwomen. </p>
<p>You lampooned Muhammad and I answered for him: 830 </p>
<p>There is a reward for that with God. </p>
<p>Would you lampoon him whom you cannot equal? </p>
<p>(The worse of you be a ransom for the better of you!) </p>
<p>You have lampooned the pure blessed hanif <br/>
God’s trusted one whose nature is loyalty. </p>
<p>Is he who lampoons God’s apostle <br/>
And he who praises and helps him equal ? </p>
<p>My father, my grandfather, and my honour <br/>
Protect Muhammad’s honour against you. </p>
<p>My tongue is a sharp sword without a flaw, </p>
<p>My verse a sea which the buckets cannot make turbid (8 ii). 3 </p>
<p>Anas b. Zunaym al-Dill apologizing to the apostle tor what 'Amr b. <br/>
Salim al-Khuza'I said about them said: </p>
<p>Was it you by whose orders Ma'add was led ? </p>
<p>Nay God guided them and said to you, Testify! </p>
<p>No camel ever carried a purer man <br/>
More true to his promise than Muhammad; </p>
<p>Swifter to do good, more lavish in giving <br/>
When he went forth like a polished Indian sword; </p>
<p>More generous in giving a rich Yamani robe hardly worn <br/>
And the horse that was easily first in the race. </p>
<p>Know, O apostle of God, that you will get me <br/>
And that a threat from you is as good as fulfilled. </p>
<p>Know, O apostle, that you have power <br/>
Over them that dwell in highland and plain. </p>
<p>Know that the riders, the riders of 'Uwaymir, </p>
<p>Are liars which break every promise. </p>
<p>They told the apostle that I satirized him. </p>
<p>1 The Diwdn has ‘and my people confessed’, &amp;c. </p>
<p>2 i.e. Quraysb who were descended from Adnan. </p>
<p>3 i.e. however many verses he composes from his inexhaustible stock the well of poesy <br/>
will not be fouled by bad and ineffectual lines. </p>
<p>5&amp;o </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Were it true may my hand never lift a whip! </p>
<p>I merely said, Woe is the mother of the heroes <br/>
Who were slain in unhappy unlucky days! </p>
<p>Those not their equal in blood killed them <br/>
And great was my weeping and dismay. </p>
<p>831 You would break the covenant if you slandered <br/>
'Abd b. 'Abdullah and the daughter of Mahwad. </p>
<p>Dhu’ayb and Kulthum and Salma went successively to death, </p>
<p>So if my eye does not weep let me grieve. </p>
<p>There is no clan like Salma and his brothers; </p>
<p>Are kings the same as slaves ? </p>
<p>I have not broken with custom or shed blood. </p>
<p>Consider, you who know the truth, and act! </p>
<p>Budayl b. 'Abdu Manaf b. Umm Asram answered him: </p>
<p>Anas wept Razn, how loud was his cry. </p>
<p>He should have wept for 'Adly unavenged and destroyed. </p>
<p>You wept, Abu 'Abs, because they were blood relations <br/>
That you might have an excuse if none started a war. </p>
<p>Noble warriors killed them on the day of Khandama, 1 <br/>
Nufayl and Ma'bad among them if you inquire. </p>
<p>If your tears flow for them you will not be blamed <br/>
And if the eye does not weep then be sad (812). </p>
<p>Bujayr b. Zuhayr b. Abu Sulma said concerning the day of the conquest: </p>
<p>Muzayna and the Banu Khufaf that day </p>
<p>Expelled the people of al-Haballaq 2 from every ravine. </p>
<p>We smote them with our sharp swords <br/>
The day the good prophet entered Mecca. </p>
<p>We came on them with seven hundred from Sulaym <br/>
And a full thousand from Banu 'Uthman. </p>
<p>We smote 3 their shoulders with cut and thrust <br/>
And shot them with our feathered shafts. </p>
<p>You could hear among the ranks their whisper <br/>
As if the notched end were split from its binding. 4 <br/>
We went with lances straight levelled </p>
<p>1 A mountain in Mecca. </p>
<p>2 I cannot understand this verse. If ‘the people of al-plaballaq’ were, as S. says, the tribes <br/>
of Muzayna and Qays, B. Khufaf being a clan of Sulaym, then we have the extraordinary <br/>
statement that Muzayna expelled their own tribesmen. We can take ‘every ravine’ as the <br/>
subject of the sentence, as C. does, and take nafd in the sense of ‘sent out’; but then we <br/>
must take Muzayna as an accusative and read BanI Kh. A.Dh. says that haballaq means <br/>
‘small sheep’ but that gives little help. What one would expect is some reference to the <br/>
Meccans, but they were not expelled from the town. </p>
<p>3 Lit. ‘trod’. For aktdjahum some MSS. have aknafahum ‘their flanks’. </p>
<p>4 After long hesitation I have adopted this rendering; but it might be that the poet is <br/>
thinking of the arrows of the opposing forces passing one another in the air. </p>
<p>561 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>While our horses wheeled among them. </p>
<p>We came back plundering as we W'ould <br/>
While they went back discomfited. </p>
<p>We pledged our faith to the apostle <br/>
In sincere friendship. </p>
<p>They heard what we said and determined <br/>
l To depart from us that day of fear (813). </p>
<p>KHALId’s EXPEDITION AFTER THE CONQUEST TO THE 833 <br/>
B. JADHlMA OF KIN AN A AND 'ATI’s EXPEDITION TO <br/>
REPAIR KHALID’S ERROR </p>
<p>The apostle sent out troops in the district round Mecca inviting men to <br/>
God: he did not order them to fight. Among those he sent was Khalid b. <br/>
al-Walld whom he ordered to go to the lower part of the flat country as a <br/>
missionary; he did not send him to fight. He subdued the B. Jadhima and <br/>
killed some of them (814). 1 </p>
<p>Hakim b. Hakim b. 'Abbad b. Hunayf from Abu Ja'far Muhammad b. </p>
<p>‘All said: When he took possession of Mecca the apostle sent Khalid forth <br/>
as a missionary. He did not send him to fight. He had with him the Arab <br/>
tribes of Sulaym b. Mansur and Mudlij b. Murra, and they subdued B. <br/>
Jadhima b. 'Amir b. 'Abdu Manat b. Kinana. When the people saw him <br/>
they grasped their weapons, and Khalid said, ‘Lay down your arms, for <br/>
everybody has accepted Islam.’ </p>
<p>A traditionist of B. Jadhima who was one of our companions told me: <br/>
‘When Khalid ordered us to lay down our arms one of our men called 834 <br/>
Jahdam said, “Woe to you, B. Jadhima! This is Khalid. If you lay down <br/>
your arms you will be bound, and after you have been bound you will be <br/>
beheaded. By God, I’ll never lay down my arms.” Some of his people laid <br/>
hold of him saying “Do you want to shed our blood? Everyone else has <br/>
accepted Islam and laid down their arms; war is over and everybody is <br/>
safe.” They persisted to the point of taking away his arms, and they them¬ <br/>
selves laid down their arms at Khalid’s word.’ </p>
<p>Hakim b. Hakim from Abu Ja'far Muhammad b. ‘All told me: As soon <br/>
as they had laid down their arms Khalid ordered their hands to be tied <br/>
behind their backs and put them to the sword, killing a number of them. <br/>
When the news reached the apostle he raised his hands to heaven and said, </p>
<p>‘O God, I am innocent before Thee of what Khalid has done’ (815). </p>
<p>Hakim on the same authority told me that the apostle summoned 'All <br/>
and told him to go to these people and look into the affair, and abolish the <br/>
practices of the pagan era. So 'All went to them with the money the apostle 835 <br/>
had sent and paid the bloodwit and made good their monetary loss even for </p>
<p>1 T-’s history (1649) is better arranged. It shows that I.J.’s narrative recorded that the <br/>
3t al - Ghuma &gt;’Sa a well belonging to Jadhima, and records the latter’s killing <br/>
of Khalid s uncle. I.H. has disturbed the natural flow of events. </p>
<p>O O </p>

<p>a dog’s bowl. When all blood and property had been paid for he still had <br/>
some money over. He asked if any compensation was still due and when <br/>
they said it was not he gave them the rest of the money on behalf of the <br/>
apostle in case claims of which neither he nor they knew at the time should <br/>
arise. Then he returned and reported to the apostle what he had done and <br/>
he commended him. Then the apostle arose and faced the Qibla and raised <br/>
his arms so that his armpits could be seen and said: ‘O God, I am innocent <br/>
before Thee of what Khalid has done.’ This he said three times. </p>
<p>Some who would excuse Khalid said that he said: ‘I did not fight until <br/>
'Abdullah b. Hudhafa al-Sahml ordered me to do so and he said, “The <br/>
apostle has ordered you to fight them because they keep back from Islam” ’ <br/>
(816). </p>
<p>Jahdam had said to them when they laid down their arms and he saw <br/>
what Khalid was doing with the B. Jadhima: ‘O B. Jadhima, the battle is <br/>
lost. I gave you full warning of the disaster into w r hich you have fallen.’ <br/>
I have heard that Khalid and Abu’l-Rahman b. ‘Auf had words about this. <br/>
The latter said to him, ‘You have done a pagan act in Islam,’ to which he <br/>
replied that he had only avenged 'Abdu’I-Rahman’s father. He answered <br/>
that he was a liar because he himself had killed his father’s slayer; but <br/>
Khalid had taken vengeance for his uncle al-Fakih b. al-Mughira so that <br/>
there was bad feeling between them. Hearing of this the apostle said, <br/>
‘Gently, Khalid, leave my companions alone, for by God if you had a <br/>
mountain 1 of gold and spent it for God’s sake you would not approach the <br/>
merit of my companions.’ </p>
<p>836 Now al-Fakih b. al-Mughira b. 'Abdullah b. 'Umar b. Makhzum, and <br/>
'Auf b. 'Abdu 'Auf b. 'Abdu’l-Harith b. Zuhra, and 'Affan b. Abu’l-'As b. <br/>
Umayya b. 'Abdu Shams had gone out trading to the Yaman. 'Affan took <br/>
his son 'Uthman and 'Auf took his son 'Abdu’l-Rahman. When they <br/>
returned they carried the money ot a man of B. Jadhima b, 'Amir, who had <br/>
died in the Yaman, to his heirs. One of their men called Khalid b. Hisham <br/>
claimed it and met them in the Jadhima territory before they could get to <br/>
the dead man’s family. They refused to give it up. A fight for the posses¬ <br/>
sion of the money took place during which 'Auf and al-Fakih were killed, <br/>
'Affan and his son escaping. They seized the property of al-Fakih and <br/>
'Auf and took it away and 'Abdu’l-Rahman killed Khalid b. Hisham the <br/>
slayer of his father. Quraysh meditated an attack on B. Jadhima, but they <br/>
declared that the assault had not been planned by them and that they did <br/>
not know of it until afterwards. They offered to pay compensation for <br/>
blood and property and Quraysh agreed, and so war was avoided. </p>
<p>One of the B. Jadhima said, though some say it was a woman called <br/>
Salma: </p>
<p>Had not one tribe said to another. Be Muslims, </p>
<p>Sulaym, that day, would have met a strong opponent. </p>
<p>1 Lit. Uhud. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad <sup>5</sup> </p>
<p>Busr and the men of Jahdam and Murra would have smitten them <br/>
Until they left the camels groaning in pain. </p>
<p>How many warriors did you see on the day of Ghumaysa’ </p>
<p>Dead, never wounded before, always giving the wounds? 1 <br/>
(War) made husbandless women remain with the marriagemakers <br/>
And separated the men who were married from their wives {817). </p>
<p>'Abbas b. Mirdas answered her; some say it was al-Jahhaf b. Hakim al- <br/>
Sulami: </p>
<p>Stop this idle talk: sufficient opponent <br/>
Are we always to the hero of the battle. </p>
<p>Khalid was more to be excused than you <br/>
The day he took the plain way in the affair. </p>
<p>Helped by God’s command driving towards you <br/>
(Horses) which stumble not going left and right. </p>
<p>They brought the news of Malik’s death in the plain when they went 837 <br/>
down to it J </p>
<p>Stern visaged showing their teeth in clouds of dust. </p>
<p>If we have bereaved you, Salma, </p>
<p>You have left 2 men and women to bewail Malik. </p>
<p>Al-Jahhaf b. Hakim al-Sulami said: </p>
<p>Horses given free rein were with the prophet at Hunayn <br/>
Bleeding from their wounds; </p>
<p>In Khalid’s raid too their hooves <br/>
Galloped in the sacred area. </p>
<p>We set our faces against the spears <br/>
Faces never given to be slapped. </p>
<p>I am not one to throw my garments from me 3 <br/>
Whenever a warrior shakes his lance, </p>
<p>But my colt beneath me bears me <br/>
To the heights 4 with my sharp sword. </p>
<p>Ya'qub b. 'Utba b. al-Mughira b. al-Akhnas from al-Zuhri from Ibn <br/>
Abu Hadrad al-Aslaml told me: I W'as with Khalid’s cavalry that day when <br/>
a young man of the B. Jadhima who was about my own age spoke to me. </p>
<p>. is hands were tied to his neck by an old rope and the women were stand¬ <br/>

<p>small thing to ask and I led him to them. As he stood by them he said, </p>
<p>' Fare you well, Hubaysha, though life is at an end. </p>
<p>Tell me when I sought and found you in Halya <br/>
Or came on you in al-Khawaniq, </p>
<p>Was I not a lover worthy to be given what he asked. </p>
<p>Who undertook journeys by night and noonday? </p>
<p>I did no wrong when I said when our people were together, <br/>
Reward me with love before some misfortune befalls! </p>
<p>Reward me with love before distance divides <br/>
And the chief goes off with a dear one thus parted. </p>
<p>For I was never disloyal to our secret troth <br/>
And my eye never looked admiringly at another. </p>
<p>When the tribe’s troubles distracted me from love <br/>
Even then the attraction of love was there (818). </p>
<p>The same authority told me that she said: 'May your life be prolonged <br/>
seven and ten continuous years and eight thereafter. Then I too tm </p>

<p>Abu Firas b. Abu Sunbula al-Aslami from some of their shaykhs from </p>
<p>one who was present said: She went to him when he was beheaded and <br/>
bent over him and kept on kissing him until she died at his side. </p>
<p>One of the B. Jadhima said: </p>
<p>God requite Mudlij for the evil they did us <br/>
Wherever they go or rest. </p>
<p>They took our goods and divided them; </p>
<p>The spears came at us not once nor twice. ^ </p>
<p>Were it not for the religion of Muhammad s people <br/>
Their cavalry 1 would have fled and been driven off. </p>
<p>What hindered them from helping a squadron <br/>
Like a swarm of locusts loose and scattered abroad ? </p>
<p>If they repent or return to their (right) way <br/>
We will not repay them for what the squadron lost. 2 </p>
<p>Wahb of the B. Layth answered him: </p>
<p>We called 'Amir to Islam and the truth. </p>
<p>It is not our fault if 'Amir turned their backs. </p>
<p>What happened to 'Amir, confound them, is not our fault <br/>
Because their minds were foolish and went astray. </p>
<p>One of the B. Jadhima said: </p>
<p>Congratulate B. Ka'b on the coming of Khalid and his companions <br/>
The mom when the squadrons came on us. </p>
<p>Ibn Khuwaylid showed no desire for revenge. </p>

<p>You would have been content had vou not been there. </p>
<p>Our men do not keep their fools from us, </p>
<p>Nor is the malady of the day of al-Ghumaysa’ cured. </p>
<p>A young man of B. Jadhima who was leading his mother and his two 839 <br/>
sisters in their flight from Khalid’s force said: </p>
<p>Set free your skirts, let your garments trail; </p>
<p>Walk as chaste women who do not quail. </p>
<p>We guard our women, we will not fail. </p>
<p>Young men of B. Jadhima known as B. Musahiq were composing rough <br/>
verse when they heard of Khalid, and one of them said: </p>
<p>Safra’ white of flanks whom a man with flocks and camels <br/>
Possesses, knows that I will do all a man can do this day. </p>
<p>And another said: </p>
<p>Safra’ who diverts her husband well knows, </p>
<p>She who eats but a morsel of meat, </p>
<p>That today I will deliver a swift blow </p>
<p>As one leaving the sacred area hits sluggish pregnant camels. </p>
<p>And another said: </p>
<p>No long-maned lion with ponderous paws, </p>
<p>Ferocious mien, and tawny whiskers, 1 </p>
<p>Roaring ’twixt jungle and thicket when the morn is cold, </p>
<p>Whose only food is man, </p>
<p>Is bolder than I was that day, I swear. </p>

<p>Then the apostle sent Khalid to al-'Uzza which was in Nakhla. It was a <br/>
temple which this tribe of Quraysh and Kinana and all Mudar used to <br/>
venerate. Its guardians and wardens were B. Shayban of B. Sulaym, allies <br/>
of B. Hashim. When the Sulami guardian heard of Khalid’s coming he <br/>
hung his sword on her, climbed the mountain on which she stood, and said: </p>
<p>O ‘Uzza, make an annihilating attack on Khalid, </p>
<p>Throw aside your veil and gird up your train. </p>
<p>O 'Uzza, if you do not kill this man Khalid </p>
<p>Then bear a swift punishment or become a Christian. 2 </p>
<p>When Khalid arrived he destroyed her and returned to the apostle. </p>
<p>1 I prefer this reading to W.’s shibal, 'cubs’. </p>

means ‘become a Muslim’, because the speaker at that date saw no difference between the <br/>
two religions. </p>
<p>566 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri from 'Ubaydullah b. 'Abdullah b. 'Utba b. Mas'ud <br/>
said: The apostle stayed in Mecca after he had occupied it for fifteen <br/>
nights, shortening prayers. The occupation of Mecca took place on the <br/>
20th Ramadan a.h. 8. </p>
<p>THE BATTLE OF HUNAYN, A.H. 8 </p>
<p>When Hawazin heard how God had given the apostle possession of Mecca, <br/>
Malik b. 'Auf al-Nasri collected them together. There assembled to him <br/>
also all Thaqif and all Nasr and Jusham; and Sa'd b. Bakr, and a few men <br/>
from B. Hilal. There were no others present from Qays 'Aylan. Ka'b and <br/>
Kilab of Hawazin kept away and no one of any importance from them was <br/>
present. Among the B. Jusham was Durayd b. al-Simma, a very old man <br/>
whose sole remaining use was his valuable advice and his knowledge of war, <br/>
for he was an experienced leader. Thaqif had tw r o leaders: Qarib b. al- <br/>
Aswad b. Mas'ud b. Mu'attib commanded the Ahlaf, and Dhu’l-Khimar <br/>
Subay' b. al-Harith b. Malik and his brother Ahmar commanded the B. <br/>
Malik. The general direction of affairs lay with Malik b. *Auf al-Nasri. <br/>
When he decided to attack the apostle he placed with the men their cattle, <br/>
wives, and children. When he halted at Autas the men assembled to him, <br/>
among them Durayd b. al-Simma in a sort of howdah in which he was <br/>
carried. As soon as he arrived he inquired what wadi they were in and <br/>
when he was told that it was Autas he said that it was a fine place for <br/>
cavalry. ‘Not a hill with jagged rocks, nor a plain full of dust; but w'hy do <br/>
I hear the groaning of camels and the braying of asses, and the crying of <br/>
children and the bleating of sheep ? M They told him that Malik had brought <br/>
them with the men, and he immediately inquired for him and said, ‘O <br/>
Malik, you have become the chief of your people and this is a day which <br/>
will be followed by great events.’ He then inquired about the cattle and the <br/>
women and children, and Malik explained that his purpose in bringing <br/>
them and putting them behind the men was to make them fight to the <br/>
death in their defence. He made a sound indicative of dismay 2 and said: <br/>
‘You sheep-tender, do you suppose that anything will turn back a man that <br/>
runs away? If all goes well nothing will help you but sword and lance; if <br/>
it goes ill you will be disgraced with your family and property.’ Then he <br/>
asked what had happened to Ka'b and Kilab; and wdien he heard that they <br/>
were not there he said, ‘Bravery and force are not here; were it a day of <br/>
lofty deeds Ka'b and Kilab would not have stayed away. I wish that you <br/>
had done what they have done. What clans have you got ?’ They told him <br/>
'Amr b. 'Amir and 'Auf b. 'Amir and he said, ‘Those two sprigs of 'Amir <br/>
can do nothing either way. You’ve done no good, Malik, by sending for¬ <br/>
ward the mainbody, the mainbody of Hawazin, to meet the cavalry. Send <br/>
them up to the high and inaccessible part of their land and meet the </p>
<p>1 The language is the oracular style of saj'. </p>
<p>2 Lit. ‘said Tchk'; other authorities say it means snapping the fingers. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 567 </p>
<p>apostates 1 on horseback. If all goes well those behind can join you, and if <br/>
the battle goes against you you wall have saved your families and stock.’ </p>
<p>Malik answered, ‘I won’t do it. You are an old dotard. You will either <br/>
obey me, O Hawazin, or I will lean on my sword until it comes out from my <br/>
back.’ He could not bear Durayd’s having any credit in the matter. Hawa¬ <br/>
zin said that they would obey him and Durayd said, ‘This is a day which <br/>
I did not witness (as a warrior) and did not altogether miss.’ </p>
<p>Would that I were young again! </p>
<p>I would ride forward gently <br/>
Leading long-haired steeds <br/>
Like young antelopes (819). </p>
<p>(T. Durayd was the chief of the B. Jusham and their leader and greatest T- 1657 <br/>
man, but old age had overtaken him so that he was feeble. His full name <br/>
was Durayd b. al-Simma b. Bakr b. 'Alqama b. Judaa b. Ghazlya b. </p>
<p>Jusham b. Muawiya b. Bakr b. Hawazin. Then Malik said to the men, </p>
<p>‘As soon as you see them, break your scabbards and attack them as one <br/>
man.’) </p>
<p>Umayya b. 'Abdullah b. 'Amr b. 'Uthman informed me that he was told 842 <br/>
that Malik sent out spies who came back with their joints dislocated. When <br/>
he asked what on earth had happened to them they said, ‘We saw white <br/>
men on piebald horses and immediately we suffered as you see.’ And, by <br/>
God, even that did not turn him back from the course he intended. </p>
<p>When the prophet heard about them he sent 'Abdullah b. Abu Hadrad <br/>
al-Aslaml to them and ordered him to go among them and stay with them <br/>
until he learned all about them, and then bring him back the news. 'Abdul¬ <br/>
lah went and stayed with them until he learned that they had decided to <br/>
fight the apostle and the dispositions of Hawazin, and then came back to <br/>
tell the apostle. (T. The apostle called for Umar and told him w r hat Ibn <br/>
Abu Hadrad had said. 'Umar said that he was a liar. He replied, ‘You <br/>
may call me a liar, 'Umar, but for a long time you denied the truth.’ 'Umar <br/>
said, ‘Do you not hear what he says, O apostle?’ and the apostle answered, </p>
<p>‘You were in error and God guided you, 'Umar.’) </p>
<p>When the apostle decided to go out against Hawazin he was told that <br/>
Safwan b. Umayya had some armour and weapons, so he sent to him <br/>
though he was at that time a polytheist, saying, ‘Lend us these weapons of <br/>
yours so that we may fight our enemy tomorrow,’ Safwan asked, ‘Are you <br/>
demanding them by force, Muhammad?’ He said, ‘No, they are a loan <br/>
and a trust until we return them to you.’ He said that in that case there was <br/>
no objection and he gave him a hundred coats of mail with sufficient arms <br/>
to go with them. They allege that the apostle asked for transport to carry’ <br/>
them and he provided it. </p>
<p>Then the apostle marched with 2,000 Meccans and 10,000 of his com¬ <br/>
panions who had gone out with him when he conquered Mecca, 12,000 in </p>
<p>The fabi was one who changed his religion; in this case the newly converted Muslims. </p>
<p>5^8 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>843 all. The apostle left in charge of Mecca 'Attab b. Asid b. Abu’l-'Is b. <br/>
Umayya b. Abdu Shams to look after the men who had stayed behind. <br/>
Then he went forward to meet Hawazin. </p>
<p>'Abbas b. Mirdas al-SuIaml said: </p>
<p>This year the ghoul of their people has smitten RiT <br/>
In the midst of their tents, for the ghoul has many forms. </p>
<p>Alas for the mother of Kilab when the cavalry of Ibn Haudha <br/>
And Insan 2 came on them unopposed. </p>
<p>Deny not your kindred, strengthen the bonds with your proteges, <br/>
Your cousins are Sa'd and Duhman. 3 </p>
<p>You will not return them though it is a flagrant disgrace (not to do so), <br/>
As long as milk is in the captured camels. </p>
<p>It is a disgrace by whose shame Hadan 4 has been covered <br/>
And Dhu Shaughar and Silwan 4 flow with it. </p>
<p>It is no better than what Hadhaf roasted </p>
<p>When he said, ‘All roasted wild ass is inedible.’ s </p>
<p>Hawazin are a good tribe save that they have a Yamanl disease: </p>
<p>If they arc not treacherous they are deceitful. </p>
<p>They have a brother—had they been true to their covenant <br/>
And had w'e reduced them by w’ar they would have been kindly. <br/>
Take to Hawazin one and all <br/>
A plain message of advice from me. </p>
<p>I think God’s apostle will attack you in the morning <br/>
With an army extending over all the plain; </p>
<p>Among them your brother Sulaym who will not let you go. </p>
<p>And the Muslims, God’s servants, Ghassan. </p>
<p>On his right are the Banu Asad </p>
<p>And the redoubtable Banu 'Abs and Dhubyan. </p>
<p>The earth almost quaked in fear, </p>
<p>And in the van are Aus and 'Uthman. </p>
<p>Aus and 'Uthman are two tribes of Muzayna (820). </p>
<p>844 Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri from Sinan b. Abu Sinan al-Du’alt from Abu <br/>
Waqid al-Laythl told me that al-Harith b. Malik said: We went forth with <br/>
the apostle to Hunayn fresh from paganism. The heathen Quraysh and <br/>
other Arabs had a great green tree called Dhatu Anwat to which they used <br/>
to come every year and hang their weapons on it and sacrifice beside it and <br/>
devote themselves to it for a day. As we w r ere going with the apostle we <br/>
saw a great lote tree and wt called out to the apostle from the sides of the <br/>
way, 'Make us a tree to hang things on such as they have.’ He said, ‘Allah </p>
<p>1 A tribe of Sulaym, Hawazin and Sulaym were brother tribes. </p>
<p>1 A tribe of Qays of the clan of B. Na$r; or from B, Jusham b. Bakr. According to A. Dh. <br/>
they were a tribe of Hawazin. </p>
<p>3 Two sons of Na?r b. Mu'awiya b. Bakr of Hawazin. </p>
<p>4 Hadan is a mountain in Najd. Dhu Shaughar and Silwan are wadis. </p>
<p>5 A paraphrase of the somewhat coarse original. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 569 </p>
<p>akbar! By Him who holds my life in His hand, You have said what Moses’ <br/>
people said to him: ‘ “Make us a god even as they have gods.’’ He said, <br/>
“You are an ignorant people. You would follow the customs of those <br/>
who were before you.” </p>
<p>'Asim b. 'Umar b. Qatada from 'Abdu’l-Rahman b. Jabir from his <br/>
father Jabir b. 'Abdullah told me: When we approached Wadi Hunayn we <br/>
came down through a wadi wide and sloping. We were descending gradu¬ <br/>
ally in the morning twilight. The enemy had got there before us and had <br/>
hidden themselves in its bypaths and side tracks, and narrow places. They <br/>
had collected and were fully prepared, and by God we were terrified when, <br/>
as we were coming down, the squadrons attacked us as one man. The <br/>
people broke and fled none heeding the other. The apostle withdrew to <br/>
the right and said, ‘Where are you going, men ? Come to me. I am God’s <br/>
apostle. I am Muhammad the son of 'Abdullah.’ And not for nothing did <br/>
the camels bump one into the other. The men ran away except that a 845 <br/>
number of Muhajirs and Ansar and men of his family remained with the <br/>
apostle. Of the Muhajirs who stood firm were Abu Bakr and 'Umar; of <br/>
his family 'All and al-'Abbas and Abu Sufyan b. al-Harith and his son; and <br/>
al-Fadl b. 'Abbas, and Rabi'a b. al-Harith and Usama b. Zayd and Ayman <br/>
b. Umm Ayman b. 'Ubayd who w r as killed that day (821). </p>
<p>There was a man of Hawazin on a red camel carrying a black banner at <br/>
the end of a long spear leading Hawazin. When he overtook a man he <br/>
thrust him with his spear. When people moved out of his reach he lifted <br/>
his spear to those behind him and they went after them. </p>
<p>When the men fled and the rude fellows from Mecca who were with the <br/>
apostle saw the flight some of them spoke in such a W'ay as to disclose their <br/>
enmity. Abu Sufyan b. Harb said, ‘Their flight will not stop before they <br/>
get to the sea!’ He had his divining arrows with him in his quiver. Jabala <br/>
b. al-Hanbal cried (822) (he together with his brother Safwan b. Umayya <br/>
was a polytheist during the respite which the apostle had given him): <br/>
‘Surely sorcery is vain today,’ Safwan said, ‘Shut up! God smash your <br/>
mouth! I w'ould rather be ruled by a man of Quraysh than a man of <br/>
Hawazin’ (823). </p>
<p>Shayba b. 'Uthman b. Abu Talha, brother of B. 'Abdu’l-Dar, said: I <br/>
said, Today I will get my revenge on Muhammad (for his father had been <br/>
killed at Uhud). Today I will kill Muhammad. I went round him to kill <br/>
him and something happened to stay my purpose so that I could not do it <br/>
and I knew that he was protected from me. </p>
<p>One of the Meccans told me that when the apostle left Mecca for Hunayn <br/>
and saw the great number of God’s armies that w r ere 'with him he said, ‘We 846 <br/>
shall not be worsted today for want of numbers.’ Some people allege that <br/>
a man of B. Bakr said this. </p>
<p>Al-Zuhri from Kathlr b. al-'Abbas from his father told me: I was w'ith <br/>
the apostle holding the ring of the bridle which I had put between the jaws </p>
<p>1 Sura 7. 134. </p>
<p>57 ° The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>of his white mule. I was a big man with a powerful voice. The apostle was <br/>
saying when he saw the army in confusion, ‘Where are you going, men?’ <br/>
And not one of them paid heed, and he said, ‘O ‘Abbas cry loudly, “O <br/>
Ansar, O comrades of the acacia tree”’ and they answered ‘Here we are 1 ; <br/>
and a man would try to turn his beast and could not do it; and he would <br/>
take his mail and throw it on its neck, and take his sword and shield and get <br/>
off his mount and let it go its way and make for the voice until he came to <br/>
the apostle. Finally a hundred were gathered by him and they went <br/>
forward and fought. At first the cry was ‘To me, Ansar!' and finally ‘To <br/>
me, Khazraj!' They were steadfast in the fight and the apostle standing in <br/>
his stirrups looked down at the melee as they were fighting and said, ‘Now <br/>
the oven is hot. 11 </p>
<p>Asim b. Umar b. Qatada from ‘Abdu’l-Rahman from his father Jabir <br/>
b. Abdullah said, While that man with the Hawazin standard on his camel <br/>
was doing as he did All and one of the Ansar turned aside making for him. <br/>
All came on him from behind and hamstrung his camel and it fell upon its <br/>
rump; and the Ansari leapt upon him and struck him a blow which sent his <br/>
foot flying with half his shank and he fell from his saddle. The men went <br/>
on fighting and, by God, when those who had run away returned they <br/>
found only prisoners handcuffed with the apostle. </p>
<p>847 The apostle turned to Abu Sufyan who was one of those who stood firm <br/>
with the apostle that day and was an excellent Muslim when he accepted <br/>
the faith, as he was holding on to the back of the saddle of his mule and <br/>
asked who it was. He replied, ‘I am your mother’s son, O apostle of <br/>
God.’ 2 </p>
<p>Abdullah b. Abu Bakr told me that the apostle turned and saw Umm <br/>
Sulaym d. Milhan who was with her husband Abu Talha. She was wearing <br/>
a striped girdle and was pregnant with her son ‘Abdullah b. Abu Talha. <br/>
She had her husband’s camel with her and was afraid that it would be too <br/>
much for her, so she brought its head near to her and put her hand in the <br/>
nose ring of hair along with the nose rein. After telling the apostle who <br/>
she was in response to his question she said, ‘Kill those who run away from <br/>
you as you kill those who fight you, for they are&gt; worthy of death! 1 The <br/>
apostle said, ‘Rather God will save (me the need), O Umm Sulaym! 1 She <br/>
had a knife with her and Abu Talha asked why, and she said, ‘I took the <br/>
knife so that if a polytheist came near me I could rip him up with it! 1 He <br/>
said, ‘Do you hear what Umm Sulaym al-Rumaysa 1 says, O apostle? 1 </p>
<p>When he set out for Hunayn the apostle had joined B. Sulaym to al- <br/>
QahhSq b. Sufyan al-Kil 5 bI so that they went along with him. And w r hen <br/>

<p>If the front and rear ranks are lost <br/>
Still they come band after band, </p>
<p>Squadrons the eyes tire in counting. </p>
<p>I used to thrust with a spear dripping with blood. </p>
<p>When the lurking craven tvas blamed <br/>
I would make a wide gash whence blood gushed audibly; </p>
<p>Blood spurting from its midst, 848 </p>
<p>Sometimes in spouts, sometimes quietly flowing, </p>
<p>The spear shaft broken in it. </p>
<p>O Zayd, O Ibn Hamham, where are you fleeing? </p>
<p>Now teeth are gone, old age has come. </p>
<p>The white long-veiled women know </p>
<p>That I am no tyro in such affairs </p>
<p>When the chaste wife is sent out from the curtains. 1 </p>
<p>Malik also said: </p>
<p>Forward, Muhaj! They are fine horsemen. </p>
<p>Do not think that the enemy have gone (824). </p>
<p>‘Abdullah b. Abu Bakr told me that he was told from Abu Qatada al- <br/>
Ansarl; and one of our companions whom I have no reason to suspect told <br/>
me from Nafi', client of B. Ghifar Abu Muhammad from Abu Qatada, that <br/>
the latter said: On the day of Hunayn I saw two men fighting, a Muslim <br/>
and a polytheist. A friend of the latter was making to help him against the <br/>
Muslim, so I went up to him and struck off his hand, and he throttled me <br/>
with the other; and by God he did not let me go until I smelt the reek of <br/>
blood (825). He had all but killed me and had not loss of blood weakened <br/>
him he would have done so. But he fell and I struck and killed him, and <br/>
was too occupied with the fighting to pay any more attention to him. One <br/>
of the Meccans passed by and stripped him, and when the fighting was <br/>
over and we had finished with the enemy the apostle said that anyone who <br/>
had killed a foe could have his spoil. I told the apostle that I had killed a <br/>
man who was worth stripping and had been too occupied with fighting at <br/>
the time and that I did not know who had spoiled him. One of the Meccans 849 <br/>
admitted that I had spoken the truth and that the spoil was in his posses¬ <br/>
sion. ‘So pay him to his satisfaction on my behalf from his spoil. 1 Abu <br/>
Bakr said, ‘No, by Allah, he shall not “give him satisfaction’ 1 from it. Are <br/>
you going to make one of God’s lions w r ho fought for His religion go shares <br/>
with you in his prey ? Return the spoil of the man he killed to him!’ The <br/>
apostle confirmed Abu Bakr’s words, so I took the spoil from him and sold <br/>
it and bought with the money a small palm-grove. It is the first property <br/>
I ever held. </p>
<p>One I do not suspect told me from Abu Salama from Ishaq b. 'Abdullah <br/>
b. Abu Talha from Anas b. Malik: Abu Talha alone took the spoil of <br/>
twenty men. </p>
<p>1 i.e. when the enemy attack the encampment and the women cannot be protected. </p>
<p>573 </p>
<p>572 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>My father Ishaq b. Yasar told me that he was told from Jubayr b. <br/>
Mut'im: Before the people fled and men were fighting one another I saw <br/>
the like of a black garment coming from heaven until it fell between us and <br/>
the enemy. I looked, and lo black ants everywhere filled the wadi. I had <br/>
no doubt that they were the angels. Then the enemy fled. </p>
<p>When God put to flight the polytheists of Hunayn and gave his apostle <br/>
power over them a Muslim woman said: </p>
<p>Allah’s cavalry have beaten Al-Lat’s cavalry <br/>
And Allah best deserves to hold fast (826). </p>
<p>When Hawazin were put to flight the killing of Thaqlf among the B. <br/>
Malik w r as severe and seventy of them were killed beneath their flag, among <br/>
whom were 'Uthman b. 'Abdullah b. Rabl'a b. al-Harith b. Habib. Their <br/>
flag was with Dhu’l-Khimar. When he was killed 'Uthman b. 'Abdullah <br/>
took it and fought by it until he was killed. </p>
<p>'Amir b. Wahb b. al-Aswad told me that when news of his death reached <br/>
the apostle he said, ‘God curse him! He used to hate Quraysh.’ </p>
<p>Ya'qub b. 'Utba b. al-Mughira b. al-Akhnas told me that a young un¬ <br/>
circumcised Christian slave was killed w r ith 'Uthman, and while one of the <br/>
Ansaris w'as plundering the slain of Thaqlf he stripped the slave to plunder <br/>
him and found that he was uncircumcised. He called out at the top of his <br/>
voice, ‘Look, you Arabs, God knows that Thaqlf are uncircumcised.’ <br/>
Mughira b. Shu'ba took hold of his hand, for he was afraid that this report <br/>
would go out from them among the Arabs, and told him not to say that, <br/>
for the man concerned was only a Christian slave. Then he began to un¬ <br/>
cover the slain and showed that they were circumcised. </p>
<p>The flag of the Ahlaf was with Qarib b. al-Aswad, and when the men <br/>
were routed he leant it against a tree, and he and his cousins and his people <br/>
fled. Only two men of the Ahlaf were killed and one of the B. Ghiyara <br/>
called Wahb and another of B. Kubba called al-Julah. When the apostle <br/>
heard of the killing of al-Julah he said, ‘The chief of the young men of <br/>
Thaqlf except Ibn Hunayda has been killed today, meaning by him al- <br/>
Harith b. Uways. </p>
<p>'Abbas b. Mirdas al-Sulaml, mentioning Qarib b. al-Aswad and his <br/>
flight from his father’s sons, and Dhu’l-Khimar and his shutting up his <br/>
people to death, said: </p>
<p>Who will tell Ghaylan and 'Urwa from me <br/>
(I think one who knows will come to him). </p>
<p>I send to tell you something </p>
<p>Which is different from what you say which will go round <br/>
That Muhammad is a man, an apostle to my Lord <br/>
Who errs not, neither does he sin. </p>
<p>We have found him a prophet like Moses, </p>
<p>Any who would rival him in goodness must fail. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Evil was the state of the B. Qasly in Wajj 1 <br/>
When each one’s affairs were decreed. </p>
<p>They lost the day (and every f people has a ruler <br/>
And fortunes change). </p>
<p>We came on them like lions of the thickets, </p>
<p>The armies of God came openly. </p>
<p>We came at the main body of B. Qasly <br/>
Almost flying at them in our rage. </p>
<p>Had they stayed I swear we would have come at them <br/>
With armies and they would not have got away. </p>
<p>We were as lions of Liya 2 there until we destroyed them <br/>
And al-Nusur 3 were forced to surrender. </p>
<p>There was a day before that day at Hunayn which is past <br/>
And blood then flowed freely. </p>
<p>In former days there was no battle like this; </p>
<p>Men of long memories have never heard of such. </p>
<p>We slew B. Hutayt in the dust by their flags <br/>
While the cavalry turned away. </p>
<p>Dhu’l-Khimar was not the chief of a people <br/>
Who possessed intelligence to blame or disapprove. </p>
<p>He led them on the road to death <br/>
As everyone could see. </p>
<p>Those who escaped were choked with terror, </p>
<p>A multitude of them were slain. </p>
<p>The languid man could not help in such a case <br/>
Nor he who was too shy and hesitant to attack. </p>
<p>He destroyed them and he perished himself. </p>
<p>They had given him the leadership and the leaders fled. </p>
<p>Banu 'Auf’s horses went at a fair pace <br/>
Fed on fresh grass and barley. </p>
<p>But for Qarib and his father’s sons <br/>
The fields and castles would have been divided, </p>
<p>But they attained prominence <br/>
By the lucky advice they were given. </p>
<p>They obeyed Qarib and they had good fortune <br/>
And good sense that brought them glory. </p>
<p>If they are guided to Islam they will be found <br/>
Leaders of men while time lasts. </p>
<p>If they do not accept it they call <br/>
For God’s war in which they will have no helper. </p>
<p>As war destroyed the B. Sa'd <br/>
And fate the clan of B. Ghazlya. </p>

<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Were like a flock of sleep coming bleating to Islam. </p>
<p>We said, ‘Be Muslims; we are your brethren, </p>
<p>For our breasts are free from enmity.’ </p>
<p>852 When the people came to us they seemed <br/>
Blind to hatred after peace had come (827). </p>
<p>When the polytheists were routed they came to al-Ta’if. Malik b. 'Auf <br/>
was with them and others were encamped in Autas. Some of them made <br/>
for Nakhla, but only the B. Ghiyara of Thaqif. The apostle’s cavalry fol¬ <br/>
lowed those who took the road to Nakhla, but not those who went to the <br/>
passes. </p>
<p>Rabl'a b. Rufay' b. Ubiban b. Tha'Iaba b. Rabl'a b. Yarbu' b. Sammal b. <br/>
'Auf b. Imru’ul-Qays who was called after his mother Ibn Dughunna more <br/>
often (828) overtook Durayd b. al-Simma and took hold of his camel’s <br/>
halter, thinking that he was a woman because he was in his howdah. And <br/>
lo, it was a man; he made the camel kneel and it was a very old man— <br/>
Durayd b. al-Simma. The young man did not know him and Durayd <br/>
asked him what he wanted and what was his name. He told him and said <br/>
that he wanted to kill him, and struck him with his sword to no effect. <br/>
Durayd said, ‘What a poor weapon your mother has given you! Take this <br/>
sword of mine that is behind the saddle in the howdah and strike me with <br/>
that above the spine and below the head, for that is the way I used to strike <br/>
men. Then when you come to your mother tell her that you have killed <br/>
Durayd b. al-Simma, for many’s the day I have protected your women.’ 1 <br/>
The B. Sulaym allege that Rabl'a said, ‘When I smote him he fell and <br/>
exposed himself, and lo his crotch and the inside of his thighs were like <br/>
paper from riding horses bareback. When Rabl'a returned to his mother <br/>
he told her that he had killed him and she said, ‘By God, he set free <br/>
three mothers and grandmothers of yours. </p>
<p>853 'Amra d. Durayd said of Rabl'a’s killing him: </p>
<p>I’ faith I did not fear the army of fate <br/>
On Durayd’s account in the valley of Sumayra. </p>
<p>God repay the B. Sulaym for him </p>
<p>And may ingratitude rend them for what they have done. </p>
<p>May He give us the blood of their best men to drink <br/>
When we lead an army against them. </p>
<p>Many a calamity did you avert from them <br/>
When they were at the point of death. </p>
<p>Many a noble woman of theirs did you free <br/>
And others you loosed from bonds. </p>
<p>Many a man of Sulaym named you noble <br/>
As he died when you had answered his call. </p>
<p>Our reward from them is ingratitude and grief </p>

Maghazt. Cf. FJamdsa, 377. </p>

<p>Which melts our very bones. </p>
<p>May the traces of your cavalry after hard travel <br/>
In Dhu Baqar as far as the desert of al-Nuhaq be effaced! </p>
<p>'Amra also said: </p>
<p>They said, ‘We have killed Durayd.’ ‘True,’ I said, </p>
<p>And my tears flowed down my garment. </p>
<p>Were it not for Him who has conquered all the tribes <br/>
Sulaym and Ka'b would have seen what counsel to follow. </p>
<p>A great army of pungent smell 1 <br/>
Would have attacked them continuously wherever they were (829). </p>
<p>The apostle sent Abu Amir al-Ash ari on the track of those who had <br/>
gone towards Autas and he overtook some of the fugitives. In the skir¬ <br/>
mishes which followed Abu 'Amir was killed by an arrow' and Abu Musa <br/>
al-Ash'arl, his cousin, took the standard. He continued the fight and God <br/>
gave him the victory and routed the enemy. It is alleged that Salama b. <br/>
Durayd shot Abu 'Amir in the knee and the w'ound proved fatal. He said: </p>
<p>If you ask about me I am Salama, g 54 </p>
<p>The son of Samadlr to one who asks further. </p>
<p>I smite with my sword the heads of the Muslims. </p>
<p>Samadlr was his mother. </p>
<p>The B. Nasr killed many of B. Ri’ab and they allege that 'Abdullah b. <br/>
Qays, called b. al-'Aura , one of B. Wahb b. Ri’ab, said to the apostle, </p>
<p>‘B. Ri’ab have perished,’ and they allege that the apostle said, ‘0 God, <br/>
make good their losses.’ </p>
<p>Malik b. 'Auf during the flight stopped with some of his horsemen at a <br/>
pass on the road and told them to wait until the weak ones passed and <br/>
those in the rear had caught up, and they did so. Malik said of that: </p>
<p>Were it not for two charges on Muhaj </p>
<p>The way would be difficult for the camp followers. </p>
<p>But for the charge of Duhman b. Nasr </p>
<p>At the palms where al-Shadiq 2 flows </p>
<p>Ja'far and Banu Hilal w'ould have returned discomfited </p>
<p>Riding two on a camel in their distress (830). </p>
<p>Salama b. Durayd who was conducting his wife until he escaped them said: 855 </p>
<p>You would have me forget though you are unhurt </p>
<p>And though you know that day at the foot of al-Azrub </p>
<p>That I protected you and walked behind you </p>
<p>Watching on all sides when to ride would have been a boon, </p>
<p>When every well--trained warrior with flowing locks </p>
<p>Fled from his mother and did not return to his friend (831). </p>
<p>1 Accoutrements were often polished with dung. </p>

<p>576 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>856 One of our companions told us that the apostle that day passed by a <br/>
woman whom Khalid b. al-Walld had killed while men had gathered round <br/>
her. When he heard what had happened he sent word to Khalid and for¬ <br/>
bade him to kill child, or woman, or hired slave. </p>
<p>One of B. Sa'd b. Bakr told me that the apostle said that day, ‘If you get <br/>
hold of Bijad, a man of B. Sa'd b. Bakr, don’t let him escape you,’ for he <br/>
had done great wrong. When the Muslims took him they led him away <br/>
with his family and with him (T. his sister) al-Shayma’d. al-Harith (T. b. <br/>
Abdullah) b. Abdu’l-'Uzza, foster-sister of the apostle. They treated her <br/>
roughly as they brought her along and she told the Muslims that she was <br/>
the foster-sister of the apostle, but they did not believe her until they had <br/>
brought her to the apostle. </p>
<p>Yazid b. 'Ubayd al-Sa'd! told me that when she was brought to the <br/>
apostle she claimed to be his foster-sister, and when he asked for proof she </p>
<p>857 said, ‘The bite you gave me in my back when I carried you at my hip.’ The <br/>
apostle acknowledged the proof and stretched out his robe for her to sit on <br/>
and treated her kindly. He gave her the choice of living with him in affec¬ <br/>
tion and honour or going back to her people with presents, and she chose <br/>
the latter. The B. Sa'd allege that he gave her a slave called Makhul and a <br/>
slave girl; the one married the other and their progeny still exists (832). </p>
<p>The names of those martyred at Hunayn were: </p>
<p>From Quraysh of B. Hashim: Ayman b. 'Ubayd. </p>
<p>From B. Asad b. 'Abdu’l-'Uzza: Yazid b. Zama'a b. al-Aswad b. <br/>
al-Muttalib b. Asad. A horse of his called al-Janah threw him and <br/>
killed him. </p>
<p>From the Ansar: Suraqa b. al-Harith b. 'Adiy from B. 'Ajlan. </p>
<p>From the Ash'arlyun: Abu 'Amir al-Ash'ari. </p>
<p>The captives of Hunayn were brought to the apostle with their property. <br/>
Mas'ud b. *Amr al-Ghifari (T. al-Qari) was over the spoils and the apostle <br/>
ordered that the captives and the animals should be brought to al-Ji'rana <br/>
and be kept in w r ard there. </p>
<p>Bujayr b. Zuhayr b. Abu Sulma said about Hunayn: </p>
<p>But for God and His servant you would have turned back <br/>
When fear overwhelmed every coward 1 <br/>
On the slope the day our opponents met us <br/>
While the horses galloped at full stretch, </p>
<p>Some running clutching their garments, </p>
<p>Others knocked sideways by hooves and chests. </p>
<p>858 God honoured us and made our religion victorious <br/>
And glorified us in the worship of the Compassionate. </p>
<p>God destroyed them and dispersed them all </p>
<p>And humiliated them in the worship of Satan (833). </p>
<p>1 Or with some authorities, ‘heart* ( jandn ). </p>

<p>'Abbas b. Mirdas said about the battle of Hunayn: </p>
<p>By the swift horses on the day of Muzdalifa </p>
<p>And by what the apostle recites from the Book </p>
<p>I liked the punishment Thaqlf got yesterday on the side of the valley. </p>
<p>They were the chief of the enemies from Najd </p>
<p>And their killing was sweeter than drink. </p>
<p>We put to flight all the army of B. Qasly. </p>
<p>The full weight fell on B. Ri’ab. </p>
<p>The tents of Hilal in Autas <br/>
Were left covered with dust. </p>
<p>If our horses had met B. Kilab’s army </p>
<p>Their women would have got up as the dust arose. 1 </p>
<p>We galloped among them from Buss to al-Aural 2 </p>
<p>Panting after the spoil </p>
<p>With a loud-voiced army, among them </p>
<p>The apostle’s squadron advancing to the fray (834). </p>
<p>'Atiya b. 'Ufayyif al-Nasri answered him: </p>
<p>Does Rifa'a boast about Hunayn? </p>
<p>And 'Abbas son of her who sucks milkless sheep! </p>
<p>For you to boast is like a maid who struts about <br/>
In her mistress’s robes while the rest of her is bare! 3 </p>
<p>’Atiya spoke these two verses because of 'Abbas’s vehemence against <br/>
Hawazin. Rifa'a was of Juhayna. </p>
<p>'Abbas b. Mirdas also said: </p>
<p>O Seal of the Prophets, you are sen with the truth 859 </p>
<p>With all guidance for the way. </p>
<p>God has built up love upon you </p>
<p>In His creation and named you Muhammad. </p>
<p>Then those who were faithful to your agreement with them, </p>
<p>An army over whom you set al-Pahhak, </p>
<p>A man with sharp weapons as though <br/>
When the enemy surrounded him he saw you. 4 <br/>
He attacked those of (his) kith and kin <br/>
Seeking only to please God and you. </p>

understand dharab to mean ‘wound’ and treat yaraka as a by-form of ardka wdth hamza <br/>

<p>A man scarred by weapons, </p>
<p>When the enemy surrounded him he was like an arak tree. </p>
<p>I owe this suggestion to Dr. Arafat. The arak is a thorny tree. The use of the accusative <br/>

<p>I tell you I saw him charging in clouds of dust <br/>
Crushing the heads of the polytheists; </p>
<p>Now throttling with bare hands, </p>
<p>Now splitting their skulls with his sharp sword. 1 <br/>
The B. Sulaym hastened before him <br/>
With continual cuts and thrusts at the enemy. </p>
<p>They walked beneath his banner there <br/>
Like lions with a haunt they mean to defend. </p>
<p>They did not hope for consideration of kinship <br/>
But obedience to their Lord and your love. </p>
<p>These were our doings for which we are renowned. </p>
<p>And our Helper is your Lord. </p>
<p>He said also: </p>
<p>If you saw, O Umm Farwa, our horses <br/>
Some led riderless and lame! </p>
<p>The battle had reduced their fitness, </p>
<p>Blood gushed from deep wounds. </p>
<p>Many a woman whom our prowess protected </p>
<p>From the hardship of war so that she 2 had no fear, said, </p>
<p>‘There are none like those who came to make an agreement <br/>
Which forged an inseparable link with Muhammad.* </p>

And Abu’l-Ghuyuth and Wasi* and al-Miqna' </p>
<p>And he who led the hundred which brought <br/>
The nine hundred to a complete thousand. </p>
<p>Banu 'Auf and the clan of Mukhashin collected six hundred <br/>
And four hundred were brought from Khufaf <br/>
There when the prophet was helped by our thousand <br/>
He handed us a fluttering standard. </p>
<p>860 We conquered with his flag and his commission bequeathed 3 <br/>
A glorious life and authority that will not cease. </p>
<p>The day that we formed the prophet’s flank </p>
<p>In the vale of Mecca when spears were quivering ’twas </p>
<p>Our answer to him who called us to our Lord in truth: </p>
<p>We went helmeted and unmailed alike, </p>
<p>With long mail whose mesh David chose <br/>
When he weaved iron, and Tubba' too. </p>
<p>By Hunayn’s two wells we had a train </p>
<p>Which slew the hypocrites—an immovable army. </p>
<p>By us the prophet gained victory; we are the people who <br/>
1 C. adds here: </p>
<p>Smiting the heads of the warriors with it </p>
<p>If you had seen as I saw his prowess you would have been satisfied. </p>
<p>3 Or ‘her people’ { sirbuhd ). </p>
<p>3 The choice of words brings out the double meaning of ‘tying’ and making an agreement. </p>
<p>579 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>In any emergency inflict loss and do well. </p>
<p>We drove off Hawazin that day with spears. </p>
<p>Our cavalry was submerged in rising dust <br/>
When even the prophet feared their bravery, and as they came en masse <br/>
The sun all but ceased to shine thereat. </p>
<p>Banu Jusham were summoned and the hordes of Nasr <br/>
In the midst while the spears w r ere thrusting <br/>
Until the apostle Muhammad said, </p>
<p>‘O Banu Sulaym, you have kept your word, now desist.’ </p>
<p>We went off and but for us their bravery </p>
<p>Would have injured the believers and they would have kept what they <br/>
had gained. </p>
<p>He also said: </p>
<p>Mijdal is deserted by its people and Mutali' 1 <br/>
And the plain of Arlk, and its cisterns are empty. </p>
<p>We had homes, O Juml, when all life was pleasant <br/>
And the change of abode 2 brought the tribe together. </p>
<p>Long absence afar has changed my beloved, </p>
<p>But can a happy past ever return ? </p>
<p>If you seek the unbelievers I do not blame you, </p>
<p>But I am a helper and follower of the prophet. </p>
<p>The best of embassies I know summoned us to them, </p>
<p>Khuzayma, and al-Marrar and Wasi', </p>
<p>So w’e came with a thousand of Sulaym finely clad <br/>
In armour woven by David. </p>
<p>We hailed him lord at the two mountains of Mecca <br/>
And it was to God that we paid homage. </p>
<p>We entered Mecca publicly with the guided one by force of arms, </p>
<p>While the dust arose in all directions. </p>
<p>Sweat covered the backs of the horses 861 </p>
<p>And warm blood from within grew hotter. </p>
<p>On the day of Hunayn when Hawazin came against us <br/>
And we could scarcely breathe <br/>
We stood steadfast with al-Dahhak; </p>
<p>Struggle and combat did not dismay us. </p>
<p>In front of the apostle a banner fluttered above us <br/>
Like the rapid movement of a cloud. </p>
<p>The night that Dahhak b. Sufyan fought with the apostle’s sword <br/>
And death was near </p>
<p>We defended our brother from our brother. 3 </p>
<p>1 Mutali* is a mountain in Najd. </p>

may well be right here. </p>
<p>3 The point is that he is of Sulaym who was from Qays to whom Hawazin belonged. The <br/>
line runs: 'Aylan Qays—Khasafa—'Ikrima—Mansur, the ‘father’ of Hawazin and Sulaym. </p>
<p>580 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Had we a choice we would have followed our own kin, </p>
<p>But God’s religion is the religion of Muhammad. </p>
<p>We are satisfied with it; it contains guidance and laws. </p>
<p>By it he set our affairs right after we had erred <br/>
And none can avert the decree of God. </p>
<p>He also said: </p>
<p>The last link with Umm Mu’ammal is broken, </p>
<p>She has changed her mind contrary to her promise; </p>
<p>She had sworn by God she would not break the link, </p>
<p>But she did not keep her word or fulfil her oath. </p>
<p>She is of Banu Khufaf who summer in the vale of al-'Aqlq 1 <br/>
And occupy Wajra and 'Urf in the deserts. </p>
<p>Though Umm Mu’ammal follows the unbelievers </p>
<p>She has made me love her more despite her distance from me. </p>
<p>Someone will tell her that we refuse to do so </p>
<p>And seek only our Lord in alliance; </p>
<p>And that we are on the side of the guide, the prophet Muhammad, <br/>
And number a thousand which (number) no (other) tribe reached. </p>
<p>With strong warriors of Sulaym <br/>
Who obey his orders to the letter, </p>
<p>Khufaf and Dhakwan and 'Auf whom you would think <br/>
Were black stallions walking among the she-camels <br/>
As though our reddish-white mail and helmets 2 <br/>
Clothed long-eared lions which meet one another in their lairs. </p>
<p>By us God’s religion is undeniably strong. </p>
<p>We added a like number to the clan that was with him. </p>
<p>When we came to Mecca, our banner <br/>
Was like an eagle soaring to dart on its prey <br/>
862 (Riding) on horses which gazed upwards. </p>
<p>You would think when they gallop in their bits there is a sound of <br/>
jinn among them, 3 </p>
<p>The day we trod down the unbelievers </p>
<p>And found no deviation or turning from the apostle’s order. </p>
<p>In a battle mid which the people heard only <br/>
Our exhortations to fight and the smashing of skulls <br/>
By swords that sent heads flying from their base <br/>
And severed the necks of warriors at a blow. </p>
<p>Often have we left the slain cut to pieces </p>
<p>1 A wadi in the Hijaz. </p>
<p>2 The reading here should be bayda ‘helmets’, not btda ‘swords’ as in C. The word is left <br/>
unpointed in W. The poet is comparing the chain flaps depending from the helmets to the <br/>
long ears of lions. </p>
<p>3 This line is difficult. A.Dh. says marawidiha means its pegs or pins ( ivatid) while S. <br/>
suggests that it means'‘where animals pasture’, i.e. go to and fro. I am indebted to Dr. W. <br/>
Arafat for the rendering given above. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 581 </p>
<p>And a widow crying Alas! over her husband. </p>
<p>’Tis God not man we seek to please; </p>
<p>To Him belongs the seen and the unseen. </p>
<p>He also said: </p>
<p>What ails thine eye painful and sleepless, </p>
<p>Its lash feeling like a piece of chaff? </p>
<p>Sorrow brings sleeplessness to the eye <br/>
And tears now cover it, now flow down <br/>
Like a string of pearls with the stringer <br/>
The thread breaks and they are scattered. </p>
<p>How far off is the home of her you long for, </p>
<p>Al-Samman and al-Hafar stand in the way! </p>
<p>Talk no more of the days of youth. </p>
<p>Youth is gone and scant white locks have come, </p>
<p>And remember the fighting of Sulaym in their settlements; </p>
<p>And Sulaym have something to boast about: </p>
<p>They are the people who helped God </p>
<p>And followed the apostle’s religion while men’s affairs were confused. <br/>
They do not plant young palms in their midst <br/>
And cows do not low in their winter quarters. </p>
<p>But steeds like eagles are kept near them <br/>
Surrounded by multitudes of camels. </p>
<p>Khufaf and 'Auf were summoned on their flanks <br/>
And the clan of Dhakwan armed and keen to fight. </p>
<p>They smote the armies of the polytheists openly <br/>
In Mecca’s vale, and killed them quickly, </p>
<p>Until we departed, and their dead </p>
<p>Were like uprooted palms in the open valley. </p>
<p>On Hunayn’s day our stand strengthened religion <br/>
And with God that is stored up. </p>
<p>Then we risked death in the gloom </p>
<p>As the black scattered dust cleared away from the horses <br/>
Under the banner with al-Dahhak leading us <br/>
As a lion walks when he enters his thicket <br/>
In a narrow place where war pressed hard. 1 <br/>
Sun and moon were almost blotted out by it. </p>
<p>We devoted our lances to God in Autas, </p>
<p>We helped whom we would and w r e became victorious <br/>
Until certain people returned to their dwellings, who <br/>
But for us and God would not have returned. </p>
<p>You will see no tribe great or small <br/>
But we have left our mark upon them. </p>

<p>582 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>He also said: </p>
<p>O rider with whom there hastens <br/>
A strong, sturdy, firm footed she-camel, </p>
<p>If you come to the prophet say to him as you should <br/>
When the assembly is quiet, </p>
<p>‘O best that ever rode a camel <br/>
Or walked the earth, if souls are weighed, </p>
<p>We were faithful to our covenant with you </p>
<p>When the cavalry were driven off by warriors and wounded </p>
<p>When there flowed from all the sides of Buhtha 1 </p>
<p>A multitude which shook the mountain paths </p>
<p>Until W’e came on the people of Mecca with a squadron </p>
<p>Glittering with steel, led by a proud chief </p>
<p>Composed of Sulaym’s sturdiest men </p>
<p>Capped in strong iron mesh with iron top </p>
<p>Blooding their shafts when they dashed into battle. </p>
<p>You would think them glowering lions. </p>
<p>They engaged the squadron wearing their badges, </p>
<p>Sword and spear in hand. </p>
<p>At Hunayn we were a thousand strong <br/>
By which the apostle was reinforced. </p>
<p>They defended the believers in the vanguard. </p>
<p>The sun w'as reflected a thousand times from their steel. </p>
<p>We went forward, God guarding us, </p>
<p>And God does not lose those He guards. </p>
<p>We made a stand in Manaqib, 2 </p>
<p>Which pleased God, w r hat a fine stand it was! </p>
<p>On the day of Autas we fought so fiercely <br/>
That the enemy had enough and cried Stop! </p>
<p>Hawazin appealed to the brotherhood between us— </p>
<p>The breast that supplied them with milk, is dry— </p>
<p>Until we left them like wild asses </p>
<p>Which wild beasts have continually preyed upon (835). </p>
<p>He also said: </p>
<p>We helped God’s apostle, angry on his account, </p>
<p>With a thousand warriors apart from unarmed men, </p>
<p>We carried his flag on the end of our lances, </p>
<p>His helper protecting it in deadly combat. </p>
<p>We dyed it with blood, for that w r as its colour, </p>
<p>The day of Hunayn when Safwan thrust with his spear. </p>
<p>We were his right w r ing in Islam, </p>
<p>We had charge of the flag and displayed it. </p>
<p>1 A clan of Sulaym. 1 On the Mecca-Ta’if road. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 5 S 3 </p>
<p>We were his bodyguard before other troops, </p>
<p>He consulted us and we consulted him. </p>
<p>He summoned us and named us intimates first of all <br/>
And we helped him against his opponents. </p>
<p>God richly rew r ard that fine prophet Muhammad </p>
<p>And strengthen him with victory, for God is his helper! (836) </p>
<p>He also said: </p>
<p>Who will tell the peoples that Muhammad, God’s apostle, </p>
<p>Is rightly guided wherever he goes ? </p>
<p>He prayed to his Lord and asked His help alone. </p>
<p>He gave it graciously fulfilling His promise. </p>
<p>We journeyed and met Muhammad at Qudayd, </p>
<p>He intending to do with us what God had determined. </p>
<p>They doubted about us in the dawn and then </p>
<p>They saw clearly warriors on horseback with levelled lances, </p>
<p>Firmly clad in mail, our infantry <br/>
A strong force like a rushing torrent. </p>
<p>The best of the tribe if you must ask </p>
<p>Were Sulaym and those who claimed to be Sulaym, </p>
<p>And an army of Helpers who did not leave him <br/>
Obeying what he said unquestioningly. </p>
<p>Since you have made Khalid chief of the army <br/>
And promoted him he has become a chief indeed <br/>
In an army guided by God whose commander you are <br/>
By which you smite the wicked with every right. </p>
<p>I sw r ore a true oath to Muhammad </p>
<p>And I fulfilled it with a thousand bridled horses. </p>
<p>The prophet of the believers said, Advance! </p>
<p>And we rejoiced that we were the vanguard. </p>
<p>We passed the night at the pool of Mustadlr; </p>
<p>There was no fear in us but desire and preparedness (for war). </p>
<p>We obeyed you till all the enemy surrendered </p>
<p>And until in the morning we overtook the crowd, the people of <br/>
Yalamlam. 1 </p>
<p>The piebald steed with reddish barrel went astray 2 <br/>
And the chief was not content till it was marked. </p>
<p>We attacked them like a flock of grouse the morning affrights. <br/>
Everyone was too concerned to see to his fellow, </p>
<p>From morn till eve till we left Hunayn <br/>
With its watercourses streaming with blood. </p>
<p>Wherever you looked you could see a fine mare </p>
<p>1 A halt two marches distant from Mecca for pilgrims coming from the Yaman </p>
<p>2 Even such a conspicuous animal was lost in the great crowd. The meaning of the next <br/>
line may be: ‘The old man was not content until he wore a distinguishing mark. </p>

<p>5§4 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>And its rider lying beside a broken lance. </p>
<p>Hawazin had recovered their herds from us </p>
<p>And it pleased them that we should be disappointed and deprived (of <br/>
them). </p>
<p>Damdam b. al-Harith b. Jusham b. 'Abd b. Habib b. Malik b. 'Auf b. <br/>
Yaqaza b. 'Usayya al-Sulami said concerning Hunayn (Thaqif had killed <br/>
Kinana b. al-Hakam b. Khalid b. al-Sharid, so he killed Mihjan and a <br/>
nephew of his, both of Thaqif): </p>
<p>We brought our horses without overdriving them <br/>
To Jurash 1 from the people of Zayyan and al-Fam, </p>
<p>Killing the young lions and making for the temples <br/>
Built before our day and not yet destroyed. </p>
<p>If you boast of the killing of Ibn al-Sharid <br/>
I have left many widows in Wajj. 2 </p>
<p>866 I killed the two of them avenging Ibn al-Sharid </p>
<p>Whom your promise of protection deceived and he blameless. </p>
<p>Our spears slew the men of Thaqif <br/>
And our swords inflicted grievous wounds. </p>
<p>He also said: </p>
<p>Tell the men with you who have wives, </p>
<p>Never trust a woman </p>
<p>After what a woman said to her neighbour, </p>
<p>‘Had the raiders not returned I should have been in the house.’ 3 <br/>
When she saw a man whom the fierce heat of a torrid land <br/>
Had left with blackened face and fleshless bones. </p>
<p>You could see his leanness at the end of the night <br/>
As he was clad in his mail for a raid. </p>
<p>I am always in the saddle of a thick short-haired mare, </p>
<p>My garment touching my belt ; 4 <br/>
One day in quest of booty, </p>
<p>Another, fighting along with the Ansar. </p>
<p>How much fertile land have I travelled, </p>
<p>How much rough uneven ground at gentle pace <br/>
That I might change her state of poverty, </p>
<p>And she did not want me to return, the baggage! (837) </p>
<p>867 Malik b. 'Auf excusing his flight said: </p>
<p>Slit-eared camels straying from the track <br/>
Prevented sleep for even an hour. </p>
<p>Ask Hawazin do I not injure their enemy </p>
<p>1 In the Yaman. 2 A place in al-Ta’if. </p>
<p>3 i.e. at the disposal of callers. </p>
<p>4 As the horse rushed forward sword and belt and garments would face the same <br/>
direction. The husband is speaking at this point. </p>
<p>585 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>And help any of them who suffers a loss ? </p>
<p>Many a squadron did I meet with a squadron <br/>
Half of them mailed, half of them without armour. </p>
<p>Many a place w'hich would appal the bold <br/>
Did I occupy first, as my people well know. </p>
<p>I came down to it and left brothers coming down <br/>
To its waters—waters of blood; 1 <br/>
When its waters rolled away they bequeathed to me <br/>
The glory of life and spoil to be divided. </p>
<p>You charged me with the fault of Muhammad’s people, </p>
<p>But God knows who is more’ungrateful and unjust. </p>
<p>You forsook me when I fought alone <br/>
You forsook me when Khath'am fought. </p>
<p>When I built up glory one of you pulled it down. </p>
<p>Builder and destroyer are not equal. </p>
<p>Many a man who becomes thin in winter, hasting to glory, </p>
<p>Generous, devoted to lofty aims, </p>
<p>I stabbed with a black shaft of Yazan’s work" </p>
<p>Headed by a long blade. </p>
<p>I left his wife turning back his friend 868 </p>
<p>And saying, You cannot come at so-and-so. </p>
<p>Fully armed I opposed the spears <br/>
Like a target which is pierced and split. </p>
<p>An. anonymous poet also said about Hawazin mentioning their expedi¬ <br/>
tion against the apostle with Malik b. 'Auf after he had acccepted Islam. </p>
<p>Recall their march against the enemy when they assembled <br/>
When the flags fluttered over Malik. </p>
<p>None was above Malik on the day of Hunayn 3 <br/>
When the crown glittered on his head <br/>
Until they met courage when courage led them <br/>
Wearing their helmets, mail, and shields. </p>
<p>They smote the men till they saw none <br/>
Round the prophet and until dust hid him. </p>
<p>Then Gabriel was sent down from heaven to help them <br/>
And we were routed and captured. </p>
<p>If any other but Gabriel had fought us <br/>
Our noble swords would have protected us. </p>
<p>‘Umar al-Faruq escaped me when they were put to flight <br/>
With a thrust that soaked his saddle in blood. 4 </p>
<p>1 Ghamra sometimes, as here, means ‘the thick of the fight . </p>
<p>2 Dhu Yazan, one of the kings of Himyar; v - s - </p>
<p>3 Or ‘Malik was a king, none above him’. j </p>
<p>4 This is the natural translation of the line, but as there is no record of ‘Umar having <br/>
been wounded in this battle the meaning may be that he escaped a thrust which would have <br/>
soaked his saddle in blood. </p>
<p>586 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>A woman of B. Jusham lamenting two of her brothers who were slain <br/>
at Hunayn said: </p>
<p>0 eyes, be generous with your tears <br/>
For Malik and al-'Ala’; be not niggardly. </p>
<p>They were the slayers of Abu ‘Amir <br/>
Who held a sword with streaky marks. </p>
<p>They left him a bleeding lump 1 <br/>
Staggering, feebly unsupported. </p>
<p>Abu Thawab Zayd b. Suhar, one of B. Sa'd b. Bakr, said: </p>
<p>Have you not heard that Quraysh conquered Hawazin <br/>
(Misfortunes have their causes). </p>
<p>There was a time, Quraysh, when if we were angry <br/>
Red blood flowed because of our rage. </p>
<p>There was a time, Quraysh, when if we were angry <br/>
It seemed as though snuff were in our nostrils. </p>
<p>And now Quraysh drive us <br/>
Like camels urged on by peasants. </p>
<p>I am not in a position to refuse humiliation <br/>
Nor am I disposed to give in to them (838). </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. Wahb, one of B. Tamlm of the clan of Usayyid, answered <br/>
him: </p>
<p>By God’s command we smote those we met <br/>
In accordance with the best command. </p>
<p>When we met, O Hawazin, </p>
<p>We were saturating heads with fresh blood. </p>
<p>When you and B. Qasfy assembled <br/>
We crushed opposition like beaten leaves. </p>
<p>Some of your chiefs we slew </p>
<p>And we turned to kill both fugitive and standfast. </p>
<p>Al-Multath lay with outstretched hands, </p>
<p>His dying breath sounding like a gasping young camel. </p>
<p>If Qays 'Aylan be angry </p>
<p>My snuff has always subdued them. </p>
<p>Khadij b. al-'Auja’al-Nasrl said: </p>
<p>When we drew near to the waters of Hunayn <br/>
We saw repellent black and white shapes <br/>
In a dense well-armed throng; if they had thrown them <br/>
At the peaks of ‘Uzwa they would have become flat. </p>
<p>If my people’s chiefs had obeyed me <br/>
We should not then have met the thick 2 cloud </p>
<p>1 Cf - 8 * 6 - 4 . </p>
<p>2 I conjecture mutakaththif for mutakashshif which gives a poor sense. On p. 870. 7 the <br/>
MSS. vacillate between kathifan and kashifan, and again the former is the better reading. <br/>
However, some such meaning as ‘looming’ might be ascribed to mutakashshif. C. says it <br/>
means zahir. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 587 </p>
<p>Nor should we have met the army of Muhammad’s people, </p>
<p>Eighty thousand reinforced by Khindif. </p>
<p>THE CAPTURE OF AL-TA’iF, A.H. 8 </p>
<p>When the fugitives of Thaqif came to al-Ta’if they shut the gates of the <br/>
city and made preparations for war. Neither 'Unva b. Mas'ud nor Ghay- <br/>
lan b. Salama were present at Hunayn or at the siege of al-Ta’if; they were <br/>
in Jurash learning the use of the testudo, the catapult, and other instru¬ <br/>
ments. 1 When he had finished at Hunayn the apostle went to al-Ta’if. <br/>
Ka'b b. Malik when the apostle came to this decision said: </p>
<p>We put an end to doubt in the lowlands and Khaybar, </p>
<p>Then we gave our swords a rest. </p>
<p>We gave them the choice and could they have spoken <br/>
Their blades w'ould have said, Give us Daus or Thaqif. </p>
<p>May I be motherless if you do not see <br/>
Thousands of us in your courts. </p>
<p>We will tear off the roofs in the valley of Wajj <br/>
And we w r ill make your houses desolate. </p>
<p>Our swiftest cavalry will come on you <br/>
Leaving behind a tangled mass. </p>
<p>When they come dowm on your courts <br/>
You will hear a cry of alarm </p>
<p>With sharp cutting sw r ords in their hands like flashes of lightning <br/>
By which they bring death to those wdio would fight them <br/>
Tempered by Indian smiths—not beaten into plates. </p>
<p>You W’ould think that the flowing blood of the warriors <br/>
Was mingled w’ith saffron the morn the forces met. </p>
<p>Good God, had they no adviser <br/>
From the peoples who knew about us <br/>
To tell them that we had gathered </p>
<p>The finest blood horses and that we had brought an army <br/>
To surround the w r alls of their fort w'ith troops? </p>
<p>Our leader the prophet, firm, </p>
<p>Pure of heart, steadfast, continent, </p>
<p>Straightforward, full of wisdom, knowledge, and clemency; </p>
<p>Not frivolous nor light minded. </p>
<p>We obey our prophet and we obey a Lord <br/>
Who is the Compassionate, most kind to us. </p>
<p>If you offer peace we will accept it <br/>
And make you partners in peace and war. </p>
<p>If you refuse we will fight you doggedly, </p>
<p>’Twill be no weak faltering affair. </p>
<p>We shall fight as long as we live </p>
<p>1 Dubiir, a sort of testudo. </p>
<p>588 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Till you turn to Islam, humbly seeking refuge. </p>
<p>We will fight not caring whom we meet <br/>
Whether we destroy ancient holdings or newly gotten gains. </p>
<p>How many tribes assembled against us <br/>
Their finest stock and allies! </p>
<p>They came at us thinking they had no equal <br/>
And we cut off their noses and ears <br/>
With our fine polished Indian swords, </p>
<p>Driving them violently before us <br/>
To the command of God and Islam, </p>
<p>Until religion is established, just and straight, and <br/>
Al-Lat and al-'Uzza and Wudd are forgotten <br/>
And we plunder them of their necklaces and earrings. </p>
<p>For they had become established and confident, 1 <br/>
And he who cannot protect himself must suffer disgrace. </p>
<p>Kinana b. 'Abdu Yalll b. 'Amr b. 'Umayr answered him: </p>
<p>Hevvho covets us wishing to fight us (let him come). </p>
<p>We are in a w r ell-known home which we never leave. </p>
<p>Our fathers w'ere here long since <br/>
And we hold its wells and vineyards. </p>
<p>‘Amr b. 'Amir put us to the test aforetime 2 <br/>
And the wise and intelligent told them about it. </p>
<p>They know if they speak the truth that we </p>
<p>Bring down the high looks of the proud. 3 </p>
<p>We force the strong to become meek </p>
<p>And the w T rongdoer to become known to the discerning. </p>
<p>We wear light mail the legacy of one who burned men 4 <br/>
Gleaming like stars in the sky. </p>
<p>•We drive them from us with sharp swords, </p>
<p>When they are draw'n from the scabbard we do not sheathe them. </p>
<p>Shaddad b. 'Arid al-Jushami said about the apostle’s expedition to al- <br/>
Ta’if: </p>
<p>Don’t help al-Lat for God is about to destroy her. </p>
<p>How can one who cannot help herself be helped ? </p>
<p>She that was burned in black smoke and caught fire. </p>
<p>None fighting before her stones, is an outcast. 5 <br/>
When the apostle descends on your land <br/>
None of her people will be left wiien he leaves. </p>
<p>1 The meaning of this hemistich may be: ‘And then they professed (Islam) and had <br/>
peace’. </p>
<p>2 This is a hit at the Ansar through their common descent. </p>
<p>3 Twist into position the head turned aside in disdain. </p>
<p>4 i.e. ‘Amr b. 'Amir. </p>
<p>5 Lit. ‘not one for whom bloodwit must be paid’. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 589 </p>
<p>The apostle journeyed by Nakhlatu’l-Yamamya, and Qarn, and al- <br/>
Mulayh and Buhratu’I-Rugha’ of Liya, 1 A mosque was built there and he 872 <br/>
prayed in it. </p>
<p>'Amr b. Shu'ayb told me that when he came there that day he allowed <br/>
retaliation for homicide, and that was the first time such a thing happened <br/>
in Islam. A man of B. Layth had killed a man of Hudhayl and he killed <br/>
him in retaliation. When he was in Liya the apostle ordered that the fort <br/>
of Malik b. 'Auf should be destroyed. Then he went on a road called <br/>
al-ipayqa. 2 As he was passing along it he asked its name. W’hen he was told <br/>
that it was ‘the strait’ he said, ‘No, it is the easy.’ 3 Then he went by Nakhb <br/>
till he halted under a lote tree called al-Sadira near the property of a man <br/>
of Thaqif. The apostle sent word to him, ‘Either come out or we will <br/>
destroy your wall.’ 4 He refused to come out so the apostle ordered his wall <br/>
to be destroyed. </p>
<p>He went on until he halted near al-Ta’if and pitched his camp there. <br/>
Some of his companions were killed by arrows there because the camp had <br/>
come too close to the wall of al-Ta’if and the arrows were reaching them. </p>
<p>The Muslims could not get through their wall for they had fastened the <br/>
gate. When these men w’ere killed by arrows he (T. withdrew and) pitched <br/>
his camp near where his mosque stands today. He besieged them for some <br/>
twenty days (839). </p>
<p>He had two of his wives with him: Umm Salama d. Abu Umayya (T. <br/>
and another with her). He struck two tents for them and prayed between <br/>
the tents. Then he stayed there. When Thaqif surrendered 'Amr b. <br/>
Umayya b. Wahb b. Mu'attib b. Malik built a mosque over the place <br/>
where he prayed. There was a pillar in the mosque. Some allege that the <br/>
sun never rises over it any day but a creaking noise 5 is heard from it. The <br/>
apostle besieged them and fought them bitterly and the two sides exchanged <br/>
arrows (840), until when the day of storming came at the w r all of al-Ta’if a 873 <br/>
number of his companions went under a testudo and advanced up to the <br/>
wall to breach it. Thaqif let loose on them scraps of hot iron so they came <br/>
.out from under it and Thaqif shot them with arrows and killed some of <br/>
them. The apostle ordered that the vineyards of Thaqif should be cut <br/>
dow r n and the men fell upon them cutting them down. </p>
<p>Abu Sufyan b. Harb and al-Mughlra b. Shu'ba went up to al-Ta’if and <br/>
called to Thaqif to grant them safety so that they could speak to them. <br/>
When they agreed they called on the women of Quraysh and B. Kinana to <br/>
come out to them for they were afraid that they would be captured, but <br/>
they refused to come. They were Amina d. Abu Sufyan who was married <br/>
to *Urwa b. Mas'ud by whom she gave birth to Da’ud b. 'Urwa (844); and </p>

<p>590 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>al-Firasiya d. Suwayd b. 'Amr b. Tha'laba whose son was 'Abdu’l-Rahman <br/>
b. Qarib; and al-Fuqaymlya Umayma d. the intercalator Umayya b. Qal'. <br/>
When they refused to come out Ibn al-Aswad b. Mas'ud said to the two <br/>
men, ‘Let me tell you of something better than that which you have come <br/>
about. You know where the property of B. Aswad is.’ (The apostle was <br/>
between it and al-Ta’if in a valley called al-'Aqiq.) ‘There is no property in <br/>
al-Ta’if more laborious to water, harder to cultivate, and more difficult to <br/>
maintain than this property of B. Aswad. If Muhammad cuts down its <br/>
trees it will never be cultivated again, so speak to him and let him take it for <br/>
himself or leave it to God and kinsmen, for there is a well-known relation¬ <br/>
ship between us.’ They allege that the apostle left it to them. </p>
<p>I have heard that the apostle said to Abu Bakr while he was besieging <br/>
al-Ta’if, ‘I saw (in a dream) that I was given a bowl of butter and a cock <br/>
pecked at it and spilt it.’ Abu Bakr said, ‘I don’t think that you will attain <br/>
874 your desire from them today.’ The apostle said that he did not think so <br/>
either. </p>
<p>Then Khuwayla d. Hakim b. Umayya b. Haritha b. al-Auqas al-Sula- <br/>
miya, wife of ‘Uthman b. Maz'un, asked the apostle to give her the <br/>
jewellery of Badiya d. Ghaylan b. Salama, or the jewellery of al-Fari'a d. <br/>
'Aqil if God gave him victory over al-Ta’if, for they were the best be¬ <br/>
jewelled women of Thaqif. I have been told that the apostle said to her, <br/>
‘And if Thaqif is not permitted to me, O Khuwayla?’ She left him and <br/>
went and told 'Umar, who came and asked the apostle if he had really said <br/>
that. On hearing that he had, he asked if he should give the order to break <br/>
camp, and receiving his permission he did so. </p>
<p>When the army moved off Sa'id b. 'Ubayd b. Asid b. Abu 'Amr b. <br/>
'Allaj called out, ‘The tribe is holding out.’ f Uyayna b. Hisn said, ‘Yes, <br/>
nobly and gloriously.’ One of the Muslims said to him, ‘God smite you, <br/>
'Uyayna! Do you praise the polytheists for holding out against the apostle <br/>
when you have come to help him?’ ‘I did not come to fight Thaqif with <br/>
you,’ he answered, ‘but I wanted Muhammad to get possession of al-Ta’if <br/>
so that I might get a girl 'from Thaqif whom I might tread (T, make <br/>
pregnant) so that she might bear me a son, for Thaqif are a people who <br/>
produce intelligent children.’ </p>
<p>During his session there some of the slaves besieged in al-Ta’if came <br/>
to him and accepted Islam and he freed them. One whom I do not suspect <br/>
from ‘Abdullah b. Mukaddam from men of Thaqif said that when al- <br/>
Ta’if surrendered some of them talked about these slaves, but the apostle <br/>
refused to do anything saying that they were God’s free men. One of those <br/>
who spoke about them was al-Harith b. Kalada (842). </p>
<p>Now Thaqif had seized the family of Marwan b. Qays al-Dausi, he <br/>
8?S having become a Muslim and helped the apostle against Thaqif. Thaqif <br/>
allege—and Thaqif is the ancestor on whom the tribe’s claim to be of Qays <br/>
is based—that the apostle said to Marwan b. Qays, ‘Seize in revenge for <br/>
your family the first man of Qays that you meet.’ He met Ubayy b. Malik </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 591 </p>
<p>al-Qushayri and took him until they should return his family to him. <br/>
AI-Dahhak b. Sufyan al-Kilabi took the matter in hand and spoke to Thaqif <br/>
until they let Marwan’s family go, and he freed Ubayy. Al-Dahhak in <br/>
reference to what passed between him and Ubayy said: </p>
<p>Will you forget my kindness, O Ubayy b. Malik, </p>
<p>The day the apostle looked away from you ? </p>
<p>Marwan b. Qays led you by his rope <br/>
Submissive as a well-trained beast. </p>
<p>Some of Thaqif behaved badly to you, </p>
<p>(If anyone comes to them asking for trouble they get it!) </p>
<p>Yet they were your relatives and their minds turned to you <br/>
When you were almost in despair (843). </p>
<p>These are the names of the Muslims who were martyred at al-Ta’if: </p>
<p>From Quraysh: the clan of B. Umayya b. 'Abdu Shams: Sa'id b. Sa'id <br/>
b. al-'As b. Umayya; and 'Urfuta b. Jannab, an ally from al-Asd b. al- <br/>
Ghauth (844); the clan of B. Taym b. Murra: 'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr was <br/>
shot by an arrow and died of it in Medina after the death of the apostle; <br/>
the clan of Makhzum: 'Abdullah b. Abu Umayya b. al-Mughira from an <br/>
arrow that day; the clan of B. 'Adiy b. Ka'b: 'Abdullah b. 'Amir b. Rabi'a <br/>
an ally; the clan of B. Sahm b. 'Amr; Al-Saib b. al-Harith b. Qays b. <br/>
'Adiy and his brother 'Abdullah; the clan of B. Sa'd b. Layth: Julayha b <br/>
'Abdullah. </p>
<p>From the Ansar: from B. Salima: Thabit b. al-Jadha'; from B. Mazin 876 <br/>
b. al-Najjar: al-Harith b. Sahl b. Abu Sa'sa'a; from B. Sa'ida: al-Mundhir <br/>
b. 'Abdullah; from al-Aus: Ruqaym b. Thabit b. Tha'laba b. Zayd b. <br/>
Laudhan b. Mu'awiya. </p>
<p>Twelve of the apostle’s companions were martyred at al-Ta’if, seven <br/>
from Quraysh, four from the Ansar, and a man from B. Layth. </p>
<p>When the apostle left al-Ta’if after the fighting and the siege Bujayr b. <br/>
Zuhayr b. Abu Sulma said commemorating Hunayn and al-Ta’if: </p>
<p>(Al-Ta’if) was a sequel to the battle of Hunayn <br/>
And Autas and al-Abraq when <br/>
Hawazin gathered their force in their folly <br/>
And were dispersed like scattered birds. </p>
<p>The (men of al-Ta’if) could not hold a single place against us <br/>
Except their wall and the bottom of the trench. </p>
<p>We showed ourselves that they might come forth, </p>
<p>But they shut themselves in behind a barred gate. </p>
<p>Our unmailed men returned 1 to a strong surging force <br/>
Fully armed glittering with death-dealing weapons; </p>
<p>Compact, dark green, (if one threw them at Hadan 2 <br/>
It would become as though it had not been created) 3 </p>

<p>DIVISION OF THE SPOIL OF HAWAZIN AND GIFTS TO <br/>
GAIN MEN'S HEARTS </p>
<p>When he left al-Ta’if the apostle went by way of Dahna until he stopped at <br/>
al-Ji'rana with his men, having a large number of Hawazin captives. One <br/>
of his companions on the day he left Thaqlf asked him to curse them but <br/>
877 he said, ‘O God, guide Thaqlf and bring them (to Islam).’ </p>
<p>Then a deputation from Hawazin came to him in al-Ji'rana where he <br/>
held 6,000 women and children, and sheep and camels innumerable which <br/>
had been captured from them. 'Amr b. Shu'ayb from his father from his <br/>
grandfather 'Abdullah b. 'Amr said that the deputation from Hawazin came <br/>
to the apostle after they had accepted Islam, saying that the disaster which <br/>
had befallen them was well known and asking him to have pity on them for <br/>
God’s sake. One of the Hawazin of the clan B. Sa'd b. Bakr (T. it was they <br/>
who had provided the fostermother for the apostle) called Zuhayr Abu <br/>
Surad said: ‘O Apostle of God, in the enclosures are your paternal and <br/>
maternal aunts and the women who suckled you who used to look after <br/>
you. Had we acted as fosterparents for al-Harith b. Abu Shimr or al- <br/>
Nu'man b. al-Mundhir and then got into the position in which you hold <br/>
us we could hope for his kindness and favour, and you are the best of trust¬ <br/>
worthy men’ (845). </p>
<p>(T. Then he said: </p>
<p>Have pity on us, apostle of God, generously, </p>
<p>For you are the man from whom we hope and expect pity. </p>
<p>Have pity on a people whom fate has frustrated, </p>
<p>Their well-being shattered by time’s misfortunes.) </p>
<p>The apostle said, ‘Which are dearest to you ? Your sons and your wives or <br/>
your cattle?’ They replied, ‘Do you give us the choice between our cattle <br/>
and our honour? Nay, give us back our wives and our sons, for that is <br/>
what we most desire.’ He said, ‘So far as concerns what I and the B. <br/>
'Abdu’l-Muttalib have they are yours. When I have prayed the noon <br/>
prayer with the men then get up and say, “We ask the apostle’s intercession <br/>
w r ith the Muslims, and the Muslims’ intercession with the apostle for our </p>
<p>1 Or ‘hounds’. </p>
<p>2 Following C. qudur which the commentators say means ‘horses that put the hind leg </p>
<p>where the foreleg has trod’. W. has fudur ‘camels’ or ‘wild goats’. It may be that camels are <br/>
meant. 1 i.e. 'Amr b. Hind, King of Hira. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 593 </p>
<p>sons and our wives.” I will then give them to you and make application on <br/>
your behalf.’ When the apostle had ended the noon prayers they did as he <br/>
had ordered them, and he said what he had promised to say. Then the <br/>
Muhajirs said that what was theirs was the apostle’s, and the Ansar said <br/>
the same. But al-Aqra b. Habis said, So far as I and B. Tamlm are con- 878 <br/>
cerned, No.’ 'Uyayna b. Hisn said No on behalf of himself and B. Fazara <br/>
and so did 'Abbas b. Mirdas for himself and B. Sulaym; but B. Sulaym <br/>
said, ‘Not so; what is ours is the apostle’s.’ 'Abbas said to B. Sulaym, ‘You <br/>
have put me to shame.’ Then the apostle said, ‘He who holds to his right <br/>
to these captives shall have six camels for every man from the first booty I <br/>
(T. we) take.’ Then the women and children were returned to their men. </p>
<p>AbQ W'ajza Yazld b. 'Ubayd al-Sa'di told me that the apostle gave 'All <br/>
a girl called Rayta d. Hilal b. Hayyan b. 'Umayra b. Hilal b. Nasira b. <br/>
Qusayya b. Nasr b. Sa'd b. Bakr; and he gave 'Uthman a girl called Zaynab <br/>
d. Hayyan; and he gave 'Umar a girl whom 'Umar gave to his son 'Abdul¬ <br/>
lah. </p>
<p>Nafi, a client of Abdullah b. Umar from 'Abdullah b. 'Umar, told me: </p>
<p>I sent her to my aunts of B. Jumah to prepare and get her ready for me until <br/>
I had circumambulated the temple and could come to them, wanting to <br/>
take her when I returned. When I had finished I came out of the mosque <br/>
and lo the men were running about, and when I asked why they told me <br/>
that the apostle had returned their wives and children to them, so I told <br/>
them that their woman was with B. Jumah and they could go and take her, <br/>
and they did so. 'Uyayna b. Hisn took an old woman of Hawazin and said <br/>
as he took her, ‘I see that she is a person of standing in the tribe and her <br/>
ransom may well be high.’ When the apostle returned the captives at a <br/>
price of six camels each he refused to give her back. Zuhayr Abu Surad <br/>
told him to let her go, for her mouth was cold and her breasts flat; she <br/>
could not conceive and her husband would not care and her milk was not <br/>
rich. So he let her go for the six camels when Zuhayr said this. They <br/>
allege that when 'Uyayna met al-Aqra' b. Habis he complained to him <br/>
about the matter and he said: By God, you didn’t take her as a virgin in 879 <br/>
her prime nor even a plump middle age!’ </p>
<p>The apostle asked the Hawazin deputation about Malik b. 'Auf and <br/>
they said that he was in al-Ta’if with Thaqlf. The apostle told them to tell <br/>
Malik that if he came to him as a Muslim he would return his family and <br/>
property to him and give him a hundred camels. On hearing this Malik <br/>
came out from al-Ta’if. He had been afraid that Thaqlf would get to know <br/>
what the apostle had said and imprison him, so he ordered that his camel <br/>
should be got ready for him and that a horse should be brought to him in <br/>
al-Ta’if. He came out by night, mounted his horse, and rode hard until he <br/>
got to the place where his camel was tethered, and rode off to join the <br/>
apostle, overtaking him in al-Ji'rana or Mecca. He gave him back his <br/>
family and property and gave him a hundred camels. He became an <br/>
excellent Muslim and at the time he said: </p>
<p>Qq </p>
<p>B 4080 </p>
<p>594 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>I have never seen or heard of a man <br/>
Like Muhammad in the whole world; </p>
<p>Faithful to his word and generous when asked for a gift, </p>
<p>And when you wish he will tell you of the future. </p>
<p>When the squadron shows its strength <br/>
With spears and swords that strike, </p>
<p>In the dust of war he is like a lion <br/>
Guarding its cubs in its den. </p>
<p>The apostle put him in command of those of his people who had <br/>
accepted Islam, and those tribes (T. round al-Ta’if) were Thumala, <br/>
Salima, and Fahm. He began to fight Thaqlf with them: none of their <br/>
flocks could come out but he raided them until they were in sore straits <br/>
Abu Mihjan b. Habib b. 'Amr b. 'Umayr al-Thaqafi said: </p>
<p>Enemies have always dreaded our neighbourhood. </p>
<p>And now the Banu Salima raid us! </p>
<p>Malik brought them on us </p>
<p>Breaking his covenant and solemn word. </p>
<p>They attacked us in our settlements </p>
<p>And we have always been men who take revenge. </p>
<p>880 When the apostle had returned the captives of Hunayn to their people <br/>
he rode away and the men followed him, saying, ‘O apostle, divide our <br/>
spoil of camels and herds among us’ until they forced him back against a <br/>
tree and his mantle was torn from him and he cried, ‘Give me back my <br/>
mantle, men, for by God if you had (T. I had) as many sheep as the trees <br/>
of Tihama I would distribute them among you; you have not found me <br/>
niggardly or cowardly or false.’ Then he went to his camel and took a hair <br/>
from its hump and held it aloft in his fingers, saying, ‘Men, I have nothing <br/>
but a fifth of your booty even to this hair, and the fifth I will return to you; <br/>
so give back the needle and the thread; for dishonesty will be a shame and a <br/>
flame and utter ignominy to a man on the resurrection day.’ One of the <br/>
Ansar came with a ball of camel hair, saying, ‘O apostle, I took this ball to <br/>
make a pad for a sore camel of mine.’ He answered, ‘As for my share in <br/>
that you can keep it!’ ‘If it has come to that,’ he said, ‘I do not want it,’ <br/>
and he threw it away (846). </p>
<p>The apostle gave gifts to those whose hearts were to be won over, notably <br/>
the chiefs of the army, to win them and through them their people. He </p>
<p>881 gave to the following 100 camels: Abu Sufyan b. Harb; his son Mu'awiya; <br/>
Hakim b. Hizam; al-Harith b. al-Harith b. Kalada brother of B. ‘Abdu’l- <br/>
Dar (847); al-Harith b. Hisham; Suhayl b. ‘Amr; Huwaytib b. 'Abdu’l- <br/>
*Uzza b. Abu Qays; al-'Ala’ b. Jariya al-Thaqafi an ally of B. Zuhra; ‘Uyay- <br/>
na b. Hisn b. Hudhayfa b. Badr; aI-Aqra‘ b. Habis al-Tamlml; Malik b. <br/>
‘Auf al-Nasri; and Safwan b. Umayya. </p>
<p>He gave less than 100 camels to the following men of Quraysh: Makh- <br/>
rama b. Naufal al-Zuhrt; ‘Umayr b. Wahb Jal-umahl; Hisham b. ‘Amr </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 595 </p>
<p>brother of B. ‘Amir b. Lu’ayy and others. He gave 50 to Sa'Id b. Yarbu' </p>
<p>b. Ankatha b. ‘Amir b. Makhzum and to al-Sahml (848) </p>
<p>He gave Abbas b. Mirdas some camels and he was dissatisfied with them </p>
<p>and blamed the apostle in the following verses: </p>
<p>It was spoil that I gained </p>
<p>When I charged on my horse in the plain </p>
<p>And kept the people awake lest they should sleep </p>
<p>And when they slept kept watch. </p>
<p>My spoil and that of ‘Ubayd my horse <br/>
Is shared by ‘Uyayna and al-Aqra'. </p>
<p>Though I protected my people in the battle, </p>
<p>Myself unprotected I was given nothing </p>
<p>But a few small camels </p>
<p>To the number of their four legs! </p>
<p>Yet neither Habis nor Hisn 1 <br/>
Surpass my father in the assembly, </p>
<p>And I am not inferior to either of them. 882 </p>
<p>And he whom you demean today will not be exalted (849). </p>
<p>The apostle said, ‘Get him away and cut off his tongue from me,’ so they <br/>
gave him (camels) until he was satisfied, this being what the apostle meant <br/>
by his order (850)4 </p>
<p>Muhammad b. Ibrahim b. al-Harith al-Tayml told me that a companion 883 <br/>
said to the apostle: ‘You have given ‘Uyayna and al-Aqra' a hundred camels <br/>
each and left out Ju‘ayl b. Suraqa al-Damr!!’ He answered, ‘By Him in <br/>
whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, Ju'ayl is better than the whole world <br/>
full of men like those two; but I have treated them generously so that they <br/>
may become Muslims, and I have entrusted Ju'ayl to his Islam.’ </p>
<p>Abu 'Ubayda b. Muhammad b. 'Ammar b. Yasir from Miqsam Abu’l- 884 <br/>
Qasim, freed slave of 'Abdullah b. al-Harith b. Naufal, told me: I went in <br/>
company with Talid b. Kilab al-Laythfto ‘Abdullah b. ‘Amr b. al-'As as he <br/>
was going round the temple with his sandals in his hand, and we asked him <br/>
whether he was with the apostle when the Tamlmlte spoke to him on the <br/>
day of Hunayn. He said that he was and that a man of Tamlm called <br/>
Dhu’l-Khuwaysira came and stood by the apostle as he was making gifts to <br/>
the men and said, ‘Muhammad, I’ve seen what you have done today.’ <br/>
‘Well, and what do you think?’ he answered. He said, ‘I don’t think you <br/>
have been just.’ The prophet was angry and said, ‘If justice is not to be </p>
<p>1 They were the fathers of the two men mentioned in line 6. </p>
<p>2 I.H.’s note in which Sura 36. 69 is quoted rests on the absurd statement of an anony¬ <br/>
mous traditionist that Muhammad was so ignorant of verse that he could not recognize <br/>
rhyme when he heard it, a poor compliment to the greatest Arab of all time. Here, for want <br/>
of a better place, I cite 1 . 1 . from al-Zuhri via Yunus (Sura 3b. 69): * ‘‘We have not taught him <br/>
verse. That does not befit him.” The meaning is ‘‘What We have taught him is not verse. It <br/>
is not fitting that he should bring verse from Us.” The apostle only uttered verse which had <br/>
been spoken by others before him.’ Akhbdru’-l-Nahtotytn al-Bafriyin, by al-Sirafi, ed. F. <br/>
Krenkow, Beyrut, 1936, pp. 72 f. </p>
<p>596 ' The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>found with me then where will you find it ?’ Umar asked to be allowed to <br/>
kill him, but he said, ‘Let him alone, for he will have a following that will <br/>
go so deeply into religion that they will come out of it as an arrow comes <br/>
out of the target; you look at the head and there is nothing on it; you look <br/>
at the butt end and there is nothing on it; then at the notch and there is <br/>
nothing on it. It went through before flesh and blood could adhere to it/ <br/>
Muhammad b. 'All b. al-Husayn, Abu Ja far, told me a similar story <br/>
and named the man Dhu’l-Khuwaysira. ‘Abdullah b. Abu Najlh told me <br/>
the same from his father (851). </p>
<p>T- 1683 (T. ‘Abdullah b. Abu Bakr told me that one of the apostle’s companions </p>
<p>who was at Hunayn with him said, ‘I was riding my camel by the side of the <br/>
apostle, wearing a rough sandal, when my camel jostled his and the toe of <br/>
my sandal hit the apostle’s shank and hurt him. He hit my foot with his <br/>
whip, saying, “You hurt me. Get behind!” so I went behind him. The <br/>
next morning the apostle was looking for me and I thought it was because <br/>
I had hurt his leg, so I came expecting (punishment); but he said, “You <br/>
hurt my leg yesterday and I struck yoqr foot with my whip. Now I have <br/>
summoned you to compensate you for it,” and he gave me eighty she- <br/>
camels for the one blow he struck me.’ 1 </p>
<p>885 *Asim b. 'Umar b. Qatada from Mahmud b. Labid from Abu Said al- <br/>
Khudri told me: When the apostle had distributed these gifts among <br/>
Quraysh and the Bedouin tribes, and the Ansar got nothing, this tribe of <br/>
Ansar took the matter to heart and talked a great deal about it, until one <br/>
of them said, ‘By God, the apostle has met his own people/ Sa'd b. 'Ubada <br/>
went to the apostle and told him what had happened. He asked, ‘Where do <br/>
you stand in this matter, Sa'd ?’ He said, ‘I stand with my people. Then <br/>
gather your people in this enclosure,’ he said. He did so, and when some </p>
<p>886 of the^Muhajirs came, he let them come, while others he sent back. When <br/>
he v had got them altogether he went and told the apostle, and he came to <br/>
them, and after praising and thanking God he addressed them thus: ‘O <br/>
men of Ansar, what is this I hear of you ? Do you think ill of me in your <br/>
hearts? Did I not come to you when you were erring and God guided <br/>
you; poor and God made you rich; enemies and God softened your hearts ?’ <br/>
They answered* ‘Yes indeed, God and His apostle are most kind and <br/>
generous.’ He continued: ‘Why don’t you answer me, O Ansar?’ They <br/>
said, ‘How shall we answer you ? Kindness and generosity belong to God <br/>
and His apostle/ He said, ‘Had you so wished you could have said—and <br/>
you would have spoken the truth and have been believed—You came to us <br/>
discredited and we believed you; deserted and we helped you; a fugitive <br/>
and we took you in; poor and we comforted you. Are you disturbed in <br/>
mind because of the good things of this life by which I win over a people <br/>
that they may become Muslims while I entrust you to your Islam ? Are <br/>
you not satisfied that men should take away flocks and herds while you take </p>

broke off when he cut out the passage from 'J’abari that contains what 1.1. wrote. </p>

Muhammad, but for the migration 1 I should be one of the Ansar myself. </p>
<p>If all men went one way and the Ansar another I should take the way of the <br/>
Ansar. God have mercy on the Ansar, their sons and their sons’ sons.’ 2 <br/>
The people wept until the tears ran down their beards as they said: ‘We are <br/>
satisfied with the apostle of God as our lot and portion’. Then the apostle <br/>
went off and they dispersed. </p>
<p>THE APOSTLE MAKES THE LESSER PILGRIMAGE FROM </p>
<p>al-ji'rana </p>
<p>Then the apostle left al-Ji'rana to make the lesser pilgrimage. He gave <br/>
orders that the rest of the spoil should be kept back in Majanna near <br/>
Marru’l-Zahran. Having completed the pilgrimage he returned to Medina. </p>
<p>He left 'Attab b. Asid in charge of Mecca. He also left behind with him <br/>
Mu'adh b, Jabal to instruct the people in religion and to teach them the 887 <br/>
Quran. He himself was followed by the rest of the spoil (852). </p>
<p>The apostle’s pilgrimage was in Dhu’l-Qa'da, and he arrived in Medina <br/>
towards the end of that month or in Dhu’l-Hijja (853). </p>
<p>.... The people made the pilgrimage that year in the way the (pagan) Arabs <br/>
used to do. 'Attab made the pilgrimage with the Muslims tfiat year, A.H, 8. </p>
<p>The people of al-Ta’if continued in their polytheism and obstinacy in their <br/>
city from the time the apostle left in Dhu’l-Qa'da of the year 8 until Rama¬ <br/>
dan of the following year. </p>
<p>THE AFFAIR OF KA'b B. ZUHAYR AFTER THE DEPARTURE <br/>
FROM AL-pA’lF </p>
<p>When the apostle arrived (at Medina) after his departure from al-Ta’if <br/>
Bujayr b. Zuhayr b. Abu Sulma wrote to his brother Ka'b telling him that <br/>
the apostle had killed some of the men in Mecca who had satirized and <br/>
insulted him and that the Quraysh poets who were left—Ibn al-Ziba'ra and <br/>
Hubayra b. Abu Wahb—had fled in all directions. ‘If you have any use for <br/>
your life then come quickly to the apostle, for he does not kill anyone who <br/>
comes to him in repentance. If you do not do that, then get to some safe <br/>
place/ Ka'b had said: </p>
<p>Give Bujayr a message from me: </p>
<p>Do you accept what I said, confound you ? </p>
<p>Tell us plainly if you don’t accept what I say </p>
<p>For what reason other than that has he led you </p>
<p>To a religion I cannot find his fathers ever held 888 </p>
<p>And you cannot find that your father followed ? </p>
<p>1 Had he not been joined by the Muhajirs from Mecca who had remained faithful to him, <br/>
he would have severed his connexion with Quraysh altogether and joined the community of <br/>
Medina. * Similarly Musa b. 'Uqba, No. 10. </p>
<p>598 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>If you don’t accept what I say I shall not grieve <br/>
Nor say if you stumble God help you! </p>
<p>Al-Ma’mun has given you a full cup to drink <br/>
And added a second draught of the same (854). </p>
<p>Bujayr said to Ka'b: </p>
<p>Who will tell Ka'b that that for which you wrongly blame me <br/>
Is the better course ? </p>
<p>To God alone not al-'Uzza and al-Lat </p>
<p>You will escape and be safe while escape is possible, </p>
<p>On a day when none will escape <br/>
Except a Muslim pure of heart. </p>
<p>Zuhayr’s religion is a thing of naught </p>
<p>And the religion of Abu Sulma is forbidden to me. </p>
<p>Ka'b used the title al-Ma’mun (855) simply for the reason that Quraysh <br/>
used to name the apostle thus. </p>
<p>When Ka'b received the missive he was deeply distressed and anxious <br/>
for his life. His enemies in the neighbourhood spread alarming reports <br/>
about him saying that he was as good as slain. Finding no way out, he <br/>
wrote his ode in which he praised the apostle and mentioned his fear and <br/>
the slanderous reports of his enemies. Then he set out for Medina and <br/>
stayed with a man of Juhayna whom he knew, according to my informa¬ <br/>
tion. He took him to the apostle when he was praying morning prayers, <br/>
and he prayed with him. The man pointed out the apostle to him and told <br/>
him to go and ask for his life. He got up and went and sat by the apostle <br/>
and placed his hand in his, the apostle not knowing who he was. He said, <br/>
‘O apostle, Ka'b b. Zuhayr has come to ask security from you as a repentant <br/>
Muslim. Would you accept him as such if he came to you? 1 When the <br/>
apostle said that he would, he confessed that he was Ka'b b. Zuhayr. </p>
<p>'Asim b. 'Umar b. Qatada told me that one of the Ansar leapt upon him <br/>
asking to be allowed to behead the enemy of God, but the apostle told him <br/>
to let him alone because he had come repentant breaking away from his <br/>
past. Ka'b was angry at this tribe of the Ansar because of what this man <br/>
had done and moreover the men of the Muhajirln spoke only tvell of him. <br/>
In his ode which he recited w r hen he came to the apostle he said: </p>
<p>Su'ad is gone, and today my heart is love-sick, in thrall to her, un¬ <br/>
requited, bound with chains; </p>
<p>And Su'ad, when she came forth on the morn of departure, was but as <br/>
a gazelle with bright black downcast eyes. </p>
<p>When she smiles, she lays bare a shining row of side-teeth that seems <br/>
to have been bathed once and twice in (fragrant) wine— </p>
<p>Wine mixed with pure cold water from a pebbly hollow where the <br/>
north-wind blow's, in a bend of the valley, </p>
<p>From which the winds drive away every speck of dust, and it brims </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 599 </p>
<p>over with white-foamed torrents fed by showers gushing from a <br/>
cloud of morn. </p>
<p>Oh, what a rare mistress were she, if only she were true to her promise <br/>
and would hearken to good advice! </p>
<p>But hers is a love in whose blood are mingled paining and lying and 890 <br/>
faithlessness and inconstancy. </p>
<p>She is not stable in her affection—even as ghouls change the hue of <br/>
their garments— </p>
<p>And she does not hold to her plighted w r ord otherwise than as sieves <br/>
hold water. </p>
<p>The promises of 'Urqub were a parable of her, and his promises were <br/>
naught but vanity. </p>
<p>I hope and expect that women will ever be ready to keep their word; <br/>
but never, methinks, are they ready. </p>
<p>Let not the wishes she inspired and the promises she made beguile <br/>
thee: lo, these wishes and dreams are a delusion. </p>
<p>In the evening Su'ad came to a land whither none is brought save by <br/>
camels that are excellent and noble and fleet. </p>
<p>To bring him there, he wants a stout she-camel which, though <br/>
fatigued, loses not her wonted speed and pace; </p>
<p>One that largely bedews the bone behind her ear when she sweats, one <br/>
that sets herself to cross a trackless unknown wilderness; </p>
<p>Scanning the high grounds with eyes keen as those of a solitary white <br/>
oryx, when stony levels and sand-hills are kindled (by the sun); </p>
<p>Big in the neck, fleshy in the hock, surpassing in her make the other <br/>
daughters of the sire; </p>
<p>Thick-necked, full-cheeked, robust, male-like, her flanks wide, her <br/>
front (tall) as a milestone; </p>
<p>Whose tortoise-shell skin is not pierced at last even by a lean (hungry) <br/>
tick on the outside of her back; </p>
<p>A hardy beast whose brother is her sire by a noble dam, and her sire's <br/>
brother is her dam’s brother; a long-necked one and nimble. </p>
<p>The qurdd 1 crawls over her: then her smooth breast and flanks cause <br/>
it to slip off. </p>
<p>Onager-like is she; her side slabbed with firm flesh, her elbow-joint 2 <br/>
far removed from the ribs; </p>
<p>Her nose aquiline; in her generous ears are signs of breeding plain for <br/>
the expert to see, and in her cheeks smoothness. </p>
<p>Her muzzle juts out from her eyes and throat, as though it were a <br/>
pick-axe. </p>
<p>She lets a tail like a leafless palm-branch with small tufts of hair hang <br/>
down over a sharp-edged (unrounded) udder from which its teats <br/>
do not take away (milk) little by little. 3 </p>
<p>1 A large species of tick. 2 Le, the middle joint of the foreleg. </p>

<p>Though she be not trying, she races along on light slender feet that <br/>
skim the ground as they fall, </p>
<p>With tawny hock-tendons—feet that leave the gravel scattered and are <br/>
not shod so that they should be kept safe from the blackness o t e </p>
<p>heaped stones, , , </p>
<p>The swift movement of her forelegs, when she sweats and the mirage </p>
<p>enfolds the hills— , </p>
<p>On a day when the chameleon basks in some high spot until its exposed </p>
<p>part is baked as in fire, </p>
<p>And, the grey cicalas having begun to hop on the gravel, the camel- <br/>
driver bids his companions take the siesta— </p>
<p>Resembles the beating of hand on hand by a bereaved grey-haire <br/>
woman who rises to lament and is answered by those who have lost </p>
<p>many a child, , </p>
<p>One wailing shrilly, her arms weak, who had no understanding when </p>
<p>news was brought of the death of her firstborn son: </p>
<p>She tears her breast with her hands, while her tunic is rent in pieces </p>
<p>from her collar-bones. , </p>
<p>The fools walk on both sides of my camel, saying, Y enly, O grandson <br/>
of Abu Sulma, thou art as good as slain’ ; x <br/>
And every friend of whom I was hopeful said, ‘I will not help thee out: </p>
<p>I am too busy to mind thee.’ </p>
<p>I said, ‘Let me go my way, may ye have no father! for whatever the </p>
<p>Merciful hath decreed shall be done. </p>
<p>Every son of woman, long though his safety be, one day is borne upon </p>
<p>a gibbous bier.’ . , , . , </p>
<p>I was told that the Messenger of Allah threatened me (with death), but <br/>
with the Messenger of Allah I have hope of finding pardon. <br/>
Gently! mayst thou be guided by Him who gave thee the gift of the <br/>
Koran, wherein are warnings and a plain setting-out (ofthe mat er). <br/>
Do not punish me, when I have not sinned, on account of what is said <br/>
by the informers, even should the (false) sayings about me be many. <br/>
Ay, I stand in such a place that if an elephant stood there, seeing </p>
<p>(what I see) and hearing what I hear, </p>
<p>The sides of his neck would be shaken with terror if there be no </p>
<p>forgiveness from the Messenger of Allah. t , . </p>
<p>I did not cease to cross the desert, plunging betimes into the darkness </p>
<p>when the mantle of Night is fallen, &lt; , </p>
<p>Till I laid my right hand, not to withdraw it, in the hand of the <br/>
avenger whose word is the word of truth. </p>
<p>For indeed he is more feared by me when I speak to him—and they </p>
<p>told me I should be asked of my lineage— </p>
<p>Than a lion of the jungle, one whose lair is amidst dense thickets in e </p>
<p>lowland of'Aththar; </p>
<p>1 Referring to his journey to the Prophet, who had already given the order for hia defcth. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 601 </p>
<p>He goes in the morning to feed two cubs, whose victual is human flesh 892 <br/>
rolled in the dust and torn to pieces; </p>
<p>When he springs on his adversary, ’tis against his law that he should <br/>
leave the adversary ere he is broken; </p>
<p>From him the asses of the broad dale flee in affright, and men do not <br/>
walk in his wadi, </p>
<p>Albeit ever in his wadi is a trusty fere, his armour and hardworn <br/>
raiment smeared with blood—ready to be devoured. </p>
<p>Truly the Messenger is a light whence illumination is sought—a drawn <br/>
Indian sword, one of the swords of Allah, </p>
<p>Amongst a band of Kuraish, whose spokesman said when they pro¬ <br/>
fessed Islam in the valley of Mecca, ‘Depart ye!’ </p>
<p>They departed, but no weaklings were they or shieldless in battle or <br/>
without weapons and courage; </p>
<p>They march like splendid camels and defend themselves with blows <br/>
when the short black men take to flight; 1 <br/>
Warriors with noses high and straight, clad for the fray in mail-coats <br/>
of David’s weaving, 2 </p>
<p>Bright, ample, with pierced rings strung together like the rings of the <br/>
qaf'a? </p>
<p>They are not exultant if their spears overtake an enemy or apt to <br/>
despair if they be themselves overtaken. </p>
<p>The spear-thrust falls not but on their throats: for them there is no <br/>
shrinking from the ponds of death (856). 4 </p>
<p>'Asim b. ‘Umar b. Qatada said: When Ka'b said, ‘When the short black <br/>
men take to flight,’ he meant us, the Ansar, because of the way one of us <br/>
had treated him. He singled out the Muhajirin among the apostle’s com¬ <br/>
panions for praise. This excited the Ansar’s anger against him. After he <br/>
had become a Muslim he spoke in praise of the Ansar and mentioned their <br/>
trials with the apostle and their position among the Yaman tribes: </p>
<p>He who loves a glorious life 893 </p>
<p>Let him ever be with the horsemen of the righteous Ansar, </p>
<p>Who transmit glorious deeds from father to son. </p>
<p>The best men are they, sons of the best men <br/>
Who launch with their arms spears <br/>
Like long Indian swords, </p>
<p>Who peer forward unweariedly <br/>
With eyes red as burning coals. </p>

<p>THE RAID ON TABUK, A.H. 9 </p>
<p>The apostle stayed in Medina from Dhu’l-Hijja to Rajab, and then gave <br/>
orders to prepare to raid the Byzantines. The following account is based <br/>
on what al-Zuhr! and Yazid b. Rtiman and 'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr and <br/>
894 'Asim b. 'Umar b. Qatada and other authorities told me; some supplied <br/>
information which others lacked. </p>
<p>The apostle ordered his companions to prepare to raid the Byzantines at <br/>
a time when men were hard pressed; the heat was oppressive and there was <br/>
T. 1692 a drought; fruit was ripe (T. and shade was eagerly sought) and the men <br/>
wanted to stay in the shade with their fruit and disliked travelling at that <br/>
season. Now' the apostle nearly always referred allusively to the destination <br/>
of a raid and announced that he was making for a place other than that <br/>
which he actually intended. This was the sole exception, for he said <br/>
plainly that he was making for the Byzantines because the journey w'as <br/>
long, the season difficult, and the enemy in great strength, so that the men <br/>
could make suitable preparations. He ordered them to get ready and told <br/>
them that he was making for the Byzantines. (T, So the men got ready in <br/>
spite of their dislike for the journey in itself to say nothing of their respect <br/>
for the reputation of the Byzantines.) </p>
<p>One day when he was making his arrangements the apostle said to Jadd <br/>
b. Qays of B. Salima: ‘Would you like to fight the B. Asfar, 2 Jadd?’ He <br/>
replied, ‘Will you allow me to stay behind and not tempt me, for everyone <br/>
knows that I am strongly addicted to women and I am afraid that if I see <br/>
the Byzantine women I shall not be able to control myself.’ The apostle <br/>
gave him permission to remain behind and turned away from him. It was </p>
<p>1 S. ii. 315 explains that Quraysh is meant by ’All because B. 'All = B. Kinana — <br/>
Quraysh. On the authorship of these verses see Introduction, xxviii, </p>
<p>2 i.e. ‘the sallow men’. A.Dh. says they are the descendants of Esau who is said to have <br/>
been of a sallow countenance. He distinguishes between the Byzantines (Riim) and the old <br/>
Greeks (Yunan). </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 603 </p>
<p>about him that the verse came down, ‘There are some who say Give me <br/>
leave (to stay behind) and do not tempt me. Surely they have fallen into <br/>
temptation already and hell encompasses the unbelievers,’ 1 i.e. it was not <br/>
that he feared temptation from the Byzantine women: the temptation he <br/>
had fallen ‘into was greater in that he hung back from the apostle and <br/>
sought to please himself rather than the apostle. God said, ‘Verily hell is <br/>
behind him.’ 2 </p>
<p>The disaffected said one to another, ‘Don’t go forth in the heat,’ disliking <br/>
strenuous war, doubting the truth, and creating misgivings about the <br/>
apostle. So God sent down concerning them: ‘And they said, Go not forth <br/>
in the heat. Say: The fire of hell is hotter did they but understand. Let <br/>
them laugh a little and let them weep much as a reward for what they were <br/>
earning’ (858). 3 </p>
<p>The apostle went forward energetically with his preparations and ordered 895 <br/>
the men to get ready with all speed. He urged the men of means to help in <br/>
providing money and mounts for God’s work (T. and persuaded them). </p>
<p>The wealthy men provided mounts and stored up a reward with God. <br/>
'Uthman b. 'Affan spent a larger sum than any had ever done (859). </p>
<p>Then seven Muslims known as The Weepers, Ansar, and others from <br/>
B. Amr b. 'Auf came to the apostle and asked him to provide them with <br/>
mounts for they were without means. Their names were: Salim b. ‘Umayr; <br/>
Ulba b. Zayd, brother of B. Haritha; Abu Layla 'Abdu’l-Rahman b. Ka'b, 896 <br/>
brother of B. Mazin b. al-Najj 3 r; 'Amr b. Humam b. al-Jamuh, brother of <br/>
B. Salima; Abdullah b. al-Mughaffal al Muzani (or b. 'Amr); Haramly b. <br/>
'Abdullah, brother of B. Waqif; and Trbad b. Sariya al-Fazari. He said <br/>
that he had no mount to give them and they turned back, their eyes flowing <br/>
with tears for grief that they had not the wherewithal to meet the expense <br/>
of the raid. </p>
<p>I have heard that Ibn Yamin b. 'Umayr b. Ka'b al-Nadrl met Abu <br/>
Layla and 'Abdullah b. Mughaffal as they w'ere weeping, and when he <br/>
asked what they were crying for they told him that they had applied to the <br/>
apostle for a mount, but that he had none to give them and they had <br/>
nothing. Thereupon he gave them a watering camel, and they saddled it <br/>
and he provided them with some dates and so they went off with the <br/>
apostle. </p>
<p>Some Bedouin came to apologize for not going, but God would not <br/>
accept their excuse. I have been told that they were from B. Ghifar. </p>
<p>(T. One of them was Khufaf b. Ima’ b. Rahda.) </p>
<p>When the apostle’s road was clear he determined to set off. Now there <br/>
was a number of Muslims who were slow to make up their minds so <br/>
that they lagged behind without any doubt or misgivings. They were <br/>
Ka'b b. Malik b. Abu Ka'b, brother of B. Salima; Murara b. al-Rabl', <br/>
brother of B. 'Amr b. 'Auf; Hilal b. Umayya, brother of B. Waqif; Abu </p>
<p>1 Sura 9. 49. 2 SQra j. ig </p>
<p>J Sura 9. 82. </p>
<p>604 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Khaythama, brother of B. Salim b. *Auf; they were loyal men whose Islam <br/>
was above suspicion. </p>
<p>When the apostle had set out he pitched his camp by- Thaniyatu’l- <br/>
Wada' (860). 1 </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. Ubayy (T. b. Salul) pitched his camp separately below him <br/>
t in the direction of Dhubab (T. a mountain in al-Jabbana below Thaniyat- <br/>
u’l-Wada'.) It is alleged that it was not the smaller camp. When the <br/>
apostle went on, 'Abdullah b. Ubayy separated from him and stayed <br/>
behind with the hypocrites and doubters. (T. 'Abdullah was brother of <br/>
B. 'Auf b. al-Khazraj, and 'Abdullah b. Nabtal was brother of B. 'Amr b. <br/>
*Auf; and Rifa'ab. Zayd b. al-Tabut was brother of B. Qaynuqa . These <br/>
were the principal men among the hypocrites and wished ill to Islam and <br/>
its people. Concerning them God sent down; They sought rebellion <br/>
aforetime and upset things for you.’) 2 </p>
<p>The apostle left 'All behind to look after his family, and ordered him to <br/>
stay with them. The hypocrites spoke evil of him, saying that he had been <br/>
left behind because he was a burden to the apostle and he wanted to get rid <br/>
of him. On hearing this 'Ali seized his weapons and caught up with the <br/>
apostle when he was halting in al-Jurf and repeated to him what the hypo¬ <br/>
crites were saying. He replied; 'They lie. I left you behind because of <br/>
what I had left behind, so go back and represent me in my family and <br/>
yours. Are you not content, 'All, to stand to me as Aaron stood to Moses, <br/>
except that there will be no prophet after me?’ So All returned to Medina <br/>
and the apostle went on his way. Muhammad b. Talha b. It azid b. Rukana <br/>
from Ibrahim b. Sa'd b. Abu Waqqas from his father Sa'd told me that he <br/>
heard the apostle saying these words to Ali. </p>
<p>Then 'All returned to Medina and the apostle went his way. Abu Khay¬ <br/>
thama (T. brother of B. Salim) returned to his family on a hot day some <br/>
days after the apostle had set out. He found two wives of his in huts in his <br/>
garden. Each had sprinkled her hut and cooled it with water and got ready <br/>
food for him. When he arrived he stood at the door of the hut and looked <br/>
at his wives and what they had done for him and said. The apostle is out <br/>
in the sun and the wind and the heat and Abu Khaythama is in a cool <br/>
shade, food prepared for him, resting in his property with a fair woman. <br/>
This is not just. By God, I will not enter either of your huts, but join the <br/>
apostle; so get ready some food for me.’ They did so and he went to his <br/>
camel and saddled it and went out in search of the apostle until he overtook <br/>
him in Tabuk. 'Umayr b. Wahb al-Jumahl had overtaken Abu Khaythama <br/>
on the road as he came to find the apostle, and they joined forces. When <br/>
they approached Tabuk Abu Khaythama said to Umayr, I have done <br/>
wrong. You can stay behind me if you like until I come to the apostle, and <br/>
he did so. When he approached the apostle as he was stopping in Tabuk, <br/>
the army called attention to a man riding on the way and the apostle said it <br/>
would be Abu Khaythama, and so it was. Having dismounted he came </p>
<p>J A pass overlooking Medina. * Sura 9-48. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 605 </p>
<p>and saluted the apostle, who said, 'Woe to you, Abu Khaythama!’ Then <br/>
he told the apostle what had happened, and he spoke him well and blessed <br/>
him (861). </p>
<p>When the apostle passed al-Hijr 1 he stopped, and the men got water <br/>
from its well. When they went the apostle said, ‘Do not drink any of its <br/>
water nor use it for ablutions. If you have used any of it for dough, then <br/>
feed it to the camels and eat none of it. Let none of you go out at night <br/>
alone but take a companion.’ The men did as they were told except two of <br/>
them of B. Saida: one went out to relieve himself and the other to look for <br/>
a camel of his. The first was half choked on his way 2 and the second was 899 <br/>
carried away by a wind which cast him on the two mountains of Tayyi’. </p>
<p>The apostle was told of this and reminded the men that he had forbidden <br/>
them to go out alone. Then he prayed for the man who was choked on <br/>
the way and he recovered; the other man was brought to the apostle in <br/>
Medina by a man of Tayyi’. This story comes from 'Abdullah b. Abu <br/>
Bakr from'Abbas b. Sahl b. Sa'd al-Sa'idl. 'Abdullah told me that 'Abbas <br/>
had told him who they were, but confidentially, so he refused to name them <br/>
to me (862). </p>
<p>In the morning when the men had no water they complained to the <br/>
apostle, so he prayed, and God sent a cloud, and so much rain fell that <br/>
they were satisfied and carried away all the water they needed. </p>
<p>Asim b. Umar b. Qatadah from Mahmud b. Labld from men of B. <br/>
Abdu 1 -Ashhal told me that he said to Mahmud, ‘Do the men know the <br/>
hypocrites among them?’ He replied that a man would know that hypo¬ <br/>
crisy existed in his brother, his father, his uncle, and his family, yet they <br/>
would cover up each other. Then Mahmud said: Some of my tribesmen <br/>
told me of a man whose hypocrisy was notorious. He used to go wherever <br/>
the apostle went and when the affair at al-Hijr happened and the apostle <br/>
prayed as he did and God sent a cloud which brought a heavy rain they <br/>
said, ‘We went to him saying “Woe to you! Have you anything more to <br/>
say after this?’’ He said, “It is a passing cloud!’” </p>
<p>During the course of the journey the apostle’s camel strayed and his <br/>
companions went in search of it. The apostle had with him a man called 900 <br/>
'Umara b. Hazm who had been at al-'Aqaba and Badr, uncle of B. 'Amr b. <br/>
Hazm. He had in his company Zayd al-Lusayt al-Qaynuqa'I who was a <br/>
hypocrite (863). Zayd said while he was in 'Umara’s camp and 'Umara <br/>
was with the apostle, Does Muhammad allege that he is a prophet and can <br/>
tell you news from heaven when he doesn’t know where his camel is?’ </p>
<p>The apostle said while 'Umara was with him: 'A man has said; Now <br/>
Muhammad tells you that he is a prophet and alleges that he tells you of <br/>
heavenly things and yet doesn’t know where his camel is. By God, I know </p>

<p>only what God has told me and God has shown me where it is. It is in <br/>
this wadi in such-and-such a glen. A tree has caught it by its halter; so go <br/>
and bring it to me.’ They went and brought it. 'Umara returned to his <br/>
camp and said: ‘By God, the apostle has just told us a wonderful thing <br/>
about something someone has said which God has told him of. Then he <br/>
repeated the words. One of his company who had not been present with <br/>
the apostle exclaimed, ‘Why, Zayd said this before you came. Umara <br/>
advanced on Zayd pricking him in the neck and saying, To me, you ser¬ <br/>
vants of God! I had a misfortune in my company and knew nothing of it. <br/>
Get out, you enemy of God, and do not associate with me. Some people <br/>
allege that Zayd subsequently repented; others say that he was suspected <br/>
of evil until the day of his death. </p>
<p>Then the apostle continued his journey and men began to drop behind. <br/>
When the apostle was told that So-and-so had dropped behind he said, <br/>
‘Let him be; for if there is any good in him God will join him to you; if not <br/>
God has rid you of him.’ Finally it w^as reported that Abu Dharr had <br/>
901 dropped behind and his camel had delayed him. The apostle said the same <br/>
words. Abu Dharr waited on his camel and when it walked slowly with <br/>
him he took his gear and loaded it on his back and went off walking in the <br/>
track of the apostle. The apostle stopped at one of his halting-places when <br/>
a man called his attention to someone walking on the way alone. The <br/>
apostle said that he hoped it was Abu Dharr, and when the people had <br/>
looked carefully they said that it was he. The apostle said, ‘God have mercy <br/>
on Abu Dharr. He walks alone and he will die alone and be raised alone. </p>
<p>Burayda b. Sufyan al-Aslarm from Muhammad b. Ka'b al-Quraz! from <br/>
‘Abdullah b. Mas'ud told me that when 'Uthman exiled Abu Dharr to al- <br/>
Rabadha 1 and his appointed time came there was none with him but his <br/>
wife and his slave. He instructed them to wash him and wind him m his <br/>
shroud and lay him on the surface of the road and to tell the first caravan <br/>
that passed who he was and ask them to help in burying him. When he <br/>
died they did this. 'Abdullah b. Masud came up with a number of men <br/>
from Iraq on pilgrimage when suddenly they saw the bier on the top of the <br/>
road: the camels had almost trodden on it. The slave got up and said, <br/>
‘This is Abu Dharr the apostle’s companion. Help us to bury him.’ 'Abdul¬ <br/>
lah b. Mas'ud broke out into loud weeping saying, The apostle was right. <br/>
You walked alone, and you died alone, and you will be raised alone.’ Then <br/>
he and his companions alighted and buried him and he told them his story <br/>
and what the apostle had said on the road to TabQk. </p>
<p>A band of hypocrites, among them Wadi'a b. Thabit, brother of B. <br/>
'Amr b. 'Auf, and a man of Ashja' an ally of B. Salima called Mukhashshin <br/>
b. Humayyir (864) were pointing at (T. going with) the apostle as he was <br/>
002 journeying to Tabuk saying one to another, ‘Do you think that fighting t e <br/>
Byzantines is like a war between Arabs ? By God we (T. I) seem to see <br/>
you bound with ropes tomorrow’ so as to cause alarm and dismay to the </p>
<p>1 A place near Medina. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 607 </p>
<p>believers. Mukhashshin said, ‘I would rather that every one of us were <br/>
sentenced to a hundred lashes than that a verse should come down about <br/>
us concerning what you have said.’ </p>
<p>The apostle-—so I have heard—told 'Ammar b. Yasir to join the men, <br/>
for they had uttered lies, and ask them what they had said. If they refused <br/>
to answer, tell them that they said so-and-so. 'Ammar did as he was <br/>
ordered and they came to the apostle making excuses. Wadi'a said as the <br/>
apostle had halted on his camel, and as he spoke he laid hold of its girth, <br/>
‘We were merely chatting and joking, O apostle.’ Then God sent down, </p>
<p>‘If you ask them they will say, We were merely chatting and joking.’ 1 <br/>
Mukhashshin b. Humayyir said, ‘O apostle, my name and my father’s name <br/>
disgrace me.’ 2 The man who was pardoned in this verse was Mukhash¬ <br/>
shin and he was named 'Abdu’l-Rahman. He asked God to kill him as a <br/>
martyr with none to know the place of his death. He was killed on the <br/>
day of al-Yamama and no trace of him was found. </p>
<p>When the apostle reached Tabuk Yuhanna b. Ru’ba governor of Ayla <br/>
came and made a treaty with him and paid him the poll tax. The people of <br/>
Jarba’ and Adhruh also came and paid the poll tax. The apostle wrote for <br/>
them a document which they still have. He wrote to Yuhanna b. Ru’ba <br/>
thus: ‘In the name of God the Compassionate and Merciful. This is a <br/>
guarantee from God and Muhammad the prophet, the apostle of God, to <br/>
Yuhanna b. Ru’ba and the people of Ayla, for their ships and their caravans <br/>
by land and sea. They and all that are with them, men of Syria, and the <br/>
Yaman, and seamen, all have the protection of God and the protection of <br/>
Muhammad the prophet. Should any one of them break the treaty by <br/>
introducing some new factor then his wealth shall not save him; it is the <br/>
fair prize of him who takes it. It is not permitted that they shall be re¬ <br/>
strained from going down to their wells or using their roads by land or sea.’ </p>
<p>Then the apostle summoned Khalid b. al-Walid and sent him to Ukaydir 903 <br/>
at Duma. Ukaydir b. 'Abdu’l-Malik was a man of Kinda who was ruler of <br/>
Duma; he was a Christian. The apostle told Khalid that he would find him <br/>
hunting wild cows. Khalid went off until he came within sight of his fort. </p>
<p>It was a summer night with a bright moon and Ukaydir was on the roof <br/>
with his wife. The cows were rubbing their horns against the gate of the <br/>
fort all the night. His wife asked him if he had ever known anything of the <br/>
kind in the past, and urged him to go after them. He called for his horse, <br/>
and w'hen it was saddled he rode off with a number of his family, among <br/>
them a brother called Hassan. As they were riding the apostle’s cavalry fell <br/>
in with them and seized him and killed his brother. Ukaydir was wearing <br/>
a gown of brocade covered with gold, Khalid stripped him of this and <br/>
sent it to the apostle before he brought him to him. </p>
<p>'Asim b. 'Umar b. Qatada from Anas b. Malik said: I saw Ukaydir’s <br/>
gown when it w'as brought to the apostle. The Muslims were feeling it </p>

<p>2 Mukhashshin implies harshness and rudeness, and humayyir means a little donkey. </p>
<p>6 0 8 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>and admiring it, and the apostle said, ‘Do you admire this? By Him in <br/>
whose hand is my life the napkins of Sa'd b. Mu'adh in Paradise are better </p>
<p><sup>Then</sup>Khalid brought Ukaydir to the apostle who spared his life and <br/>
made peace with him on condition that he paid the poll tax. Then he <br/>
released him and he returned to his town. A man of Tayyi called Bujayr <br/>
b. Bujara remembering the words of the apostle to Khalid, You will find <br/>
him hunting wild cows,’ said that what the cows did that night in bringing <br/>
him out of his fort was to confirm what the apostle had said: </p>
<p>Blessed is He who drove out the cows. </p>
<p>I see God guiding every leader. </p>
<p>Those who turn aside from yonder Tabuk, (let them) </p>
<p>For we have been ordered to fight. </p>
<p>904 The apostle stayed in Tabuk some ten nights, not more. Then he <br/>
returned to Medina. </p>
<p>On the way there was water issuing from a rock—enough to water two <br/>
or three riders. It was in a wadi called al-Mushaqqaq. The apostle ordered <br/>
anyone who should get there before him not to take water from it until he <br/>
came. A number of the disaffected got there first and drew water from it. <br/>
When the apostle arrived he halted and saw no water there. He asked who <br/>
had got there first and was told their names. He exclaimed, Did I not <br/>
forbid you to take water from it until I came?’ Then he cursed them an <br/>
called down God’s vengeance on them. Then he alighted and placed his <br/>
hand under the rock, and water began to flow into his hand as God willed. <br/>
Then he sprinkled the rock with the water and rubbed it with his hand and <br/>
prayed as God willed him to pray. Then water burst forth, as one who <br/>
heard it said, with a sound like thunder. The men drank and satisfied their <br/>
need from it, and the apostle said, ‘If you live, or those of you who live, will <br/>
hear of this wadi that it is more fertile than its neighbours.’ </p>
<p>Muhammad b. Ibrahim b. al-Harith al-Taymi told me that ‘Abdullah b. <br/>
Mas'ud used to say: I got up in the middle of the night when I was with <br/>
the apostle in the raid on Tabuk when I saw a light near the camp. I went <br/>
after it to look at it and lo it was the apostle with Abu Bakr and Umar; and <br/>
‘Abdullah Dhu 1 -Bijadayn had just died and they had dug a grave for him. <br/>
The apostle was in the grave and Abu Bakr and Umar were letting him <br/>
905 down to him as he was saying, ‘Bring your brother near to me, so they let <br/>
him down and as he arranged him for his niche he said, O God, I am <br/>
pleased with him; be Thou pleased with himl’ Abdullah b. Mas*ud used <br/>
to say, ‘Would that I had been the man in the grave’ (865). </p>
<p>Ibn Shihab al-Zuhrl reported from Ibn Ukayma al-Laythi from Ibn <br/>
Akhi Abi Ruhm al-Ghifari that he heard Abu Ruhm Kulthum b. al- <br/>
Husayn, who was one of the companions who did homage to the apostle <br/>
beneath the tree, say: When I made the raid on Tabuk with the apostle I <br/>
journeyed the night with him. While we were at al-Akhdar near the </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad '609 </p>
<p>apostle God cast a heavy sleep on us and I began to wake up when my <br/>
camel had come near the apostle’s camel. I was afraid that if it came too <br/>
near his foot would be hurt in the stirrup. I began to move my camel away <br/>
from him until sleep overcame me on the way. Then during the night my <br/>
camel jostled against his while his foot was in the stirrup and I was wakened <br/>
by his voice saying, ‘Look out.’ I asked his pardon and he told me to carry <br/>
on. The apostle began to ask me about those who had dropped out from <br/>
B. Ghifar and I told him. He asked me about the people with long <br/>
straggling red beards and I told him that they had dropped out. Then he <br/>
asked about the men "with short curly hair and I confessed that I did not <br/>
know that they were of us. ‘But yes,’ he said, ‘they are those who own 906 <br/>
camels in Shabakatu Shadakh.’ Then I remembered that they were <br/>
among B. Ghifar, but I did not remember them until I recalled that they <br/>
were a clan of Aslam who were allies of ours. When I told him this he said, <br/>
‘What prevented one of these when he fell out from mounting a zealous <br/>
man in the way of God on one of his camels ? The most painful thing to <br/>
me is that muhajirun from Quraysh and the Ansar and Ghifar and Aslam <br/>
should stay behind.’ </p>
<p>THE OPPOSITION MOSQUE </p>
<p>The apostle went on until he stopped in Dhu Awan a town an hour’s day¬ <br/>
light journey from Medina. The owners of the mosque of opposition had <br/>
come to the apostle as he was preparing for Tabuk, saying, ‘We have built <br/>
a mosque for the sick and needy and for nights of bad weather, and we <br/>
should like you to come to us and pray for us there.’ He said that he was <br/>
on the point of travelling, and was preoccupied, or words to that effect, <br/>
and that when he came back if God willed he would come to them and <br/>
pray for them in it. </p>
<p>When he stopped in Dhu Awan news of the mosque came to him, and he <br/>
summoned Malik b. al-Dukhshum, brother of B. Salim b. ‘Auf, and Ma'n <br/>
b. 'Adiy (or his brother 'Asim) brother of B. al-‘Ajlan, and told them to go <br/>
to the mosque of those evil men and destroy and burn it. They went <br/>
quickly to B. Salim b. 'Auf who were Malik’s clan, and Malik said to Ma'n, <br/>
‘Wait for me until I can bring fire from my people.’ So he went in and <br/>
took a palm-branch and lighted it, and then the two of them ran into the <br/>
mosque where its people were and burned and destroyed it and the people <br/>
ran away from it. A portion of the Quran came do\yj concerning them: <br/>
‘Those who chose a mosque in opposition and unbelief and to cause divi¬ <br/>
sion among believers’ to the end of the passage. 1 </p>
<p>The twelve men who built it were: Khidham b. Khalid of B. ‘Ubayd b. 907 <br/>
Zayd, one of B. ‘Amr b. ‘Auf; his house opened on to the schismatic <br/>
mosque; Tha'laba b. Hatib of B. Umayya b. Zayd; Mu'attib b. Qushayr; </p>

<p>THE THREE MEN WHO ABSTAINED FROM THE RAID <br/>
ON TABUK </p>
<p>When the apostle came to Medina he found that some disaffected persons <br/>
had stayed behind. Among them were three Muslims who hadnot held <br/>
back through doubt or disaffection, namely Ka'b b. Malik, Murara b. al- <br/>
Rabi' and Hilal b. Umayya. The apostle told his companions not to speak <br/>
to these three. The disaffected who had stayed behind came and made <br/>
excuses with oaths and he forgave them, but neither God nor His apostle <br/>
accepted their excuse. The Muslims withdrew from these three and would <br/>
not speak to them (T. until God sent down His word concerning them) <br/>
Muhammad b. Muslim b. Shihab al-Zuhrl from 'Abdu’l-Rahman b. <br/>
'Abdullah b. Ka'b b. Malik said that his father, whom he used to lead <br/>
about when his sight failed, said: I heard my father Ka'b telling his story <br/>
of how he held back from the apostle in his raid on Tabuk, and the story of <br/>
his two companions: </p>
<p>I had never held back from any raid the apostle had undertaken except <br/>
the battle of Badr, and that was an engagement which none was blamed <br/>
either by God or His apostle for missing because the apostle had gone out <br/>
only to find the Quraysh caravan when God brought him and his enemies <br/>
together without previous intent. I was present with the apostle at al- <br/>
'Aqaba when we pledged our faith in Islam, and I should not prefer to <br/>
have been at Badr rather than there even if the battle of Badr is more <br/>
famous. The fact was that when I stayed behind in the raid on 1 abuk 1 <br/>
had never been stronger and wealthier. Never before had I possessed two <br/>
camels. Seldom did the apostle intend a raid but he pretended that he had <br/>
another objective except on this occasion. He raided it in violent heat an <br/>
faced a long journey and a powerful enemy and told men what they had to <br/>
do so that they might make adequate provision, and he told them the direc¬ <br/>
tion he intended to take. The Muslims who followed him were many and <br/>
he did not enrol them in a book. (He meant by that a register; he did not <br/>
enrol them in a written register). The few who wanted to absent themselves </p>
<p>2 Sura 9. 118-20. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 611 </p>
<p>thought that they could conceal it from him as long as no revelation came <br/>
down from God about it. The apostle made that raid when the fruits were <br/>
ripe and shade was desirable so that men were averse from it. The apostle <br/>
made his preparations and the Muslims likewise, and I would go to get ready <br/>
with them and come back not having done what was necessary, saying to <br/>
myself, ‘I can do that when I want to,’ and I continued procrastinating <br/>
until the men had acted with energy and in the morning they and the 909 <br/>
apostle had gone while I had made no preparation. I thought that I could <br/>
get ready a day or two later and then join them. Day after day passed and <br/>
I had done nothing until the raiders had gone far ahead and still I thought <br/>
of going and overtaking and I wish that I had done so but I did not. After <br/>
the apostle had gone when I went about among the men it pained me to see <br/>
only those who were accused of disaffection or a man whom God had <br/>
excused because of his helpless women. The apostle did not remember me <br/>
until he reached Tabuk w'hen he asked, as he w'as sitting among the men, <br/>
what had become of me. One of the B. Salima said that my fine clothes <br/>
and conceit of my appearance kept me at home. Mu'adh b. Jabal said that <br/>
that w'as an evil thing to say and that they knew' nothing but good of me. </p>
<p>But the apostle was silent. </p>
<p>When I heard that the apostle w'as on his way back from Tabuk I was <br/>
smitten with remorse and began to think of a lie I could tell to escape from <br/>
his anger and get some of my people to support me in it; but when I heard <br/>
that he w'as near at hand falsehood left me and I knew that I could only <br/>
escape by telling the truth, so I determined to do so. In the morning the <br/>
apostle entered Medina and went into the mosque and after performing two <br/>
rak'as he sat dowm to await the men. Those who had stayed behind came <br/>
and began to make excuses with oaths—there were about eighty of them— <br/>
and the apostle accepted their public declarations and oaths and asked the <br/>
divine forgiveness for them, referring their secret thoughts to God. Last <br/>
of all I came and saluted him and he smiled as one who is angry. He told <br/>
me to come near, and when I sat before him he asked me what had kept <br/>
me back, and had I not bought my mount. I said, ‘O apostle of God, were <br/>
I sitting with anyone else in the world I should count on escaping his <br/>
anger by an excuse, for I am astute in argument. But I know that if I tell 910 <br/>
you a lie today you will accept it and that God will soon excite your anger <br/>
against me; and yet if I tell you the truth which will make you angry w'ith <br/>
me, I have hopes that God will reward me for it in the end. Indeed, I have <br/>
no excuse. I was never stronger and richer than when I stayed behind.’ </p>
<p>The apostle said, ‘So far as that goes you have told the truth, but get up <br/>
until God. decides about you.’ So I got up and some of B. Salima rose in <br/>
annoyance and followed me, saying, ‘We have never knowm you do wrong <br/>
before, and you w'ere unable to excuse yourself to the apostle as the others <br/>
w'ho stayed behind did. It would have sufficed if the apostle had asked <br/>
pardon for your sin.’ They kept at me until I w'anted to ^o back to the <br/>
apostle and give the lie to myself. Then I asked them if any others w'ere in </p>
<p>Ir. Yaqut ‘ai-Kawakib’. </p>
<p>612 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>the same case and they said that there were two men who had said what I <br/>
had said, and they got the same answer. They were Murara b. ai-RabI f <br/>
al-'Amri of B. 'Amr b. ‘Auf, and Hilal b. Abu Umayya al-Waqift, two <br/>
honest men of exemplary character. When they mentioned them I was <br/>
silent. The apostle forbade anyone to speak to us three out of those who <br/>
had stayed behind, so men avoided us and showed an altered demeanour, <br/>
until I hated myself and the whole world as never before. We endured this <br/>
for fifty nights. As for my two companions in misfortune they were humi¬ <br/>
liated and stayed in their houses, but I was younger and hardier, so I used <br/>
to go out and attend prayers with the Muslims, and go round the markets <br/>
while no one spoke to me; and I would go to the apostle and salute him <br/>
while he sat after prayers, asking myself if his lips had moved in returning <br/>
the salutation or not; then I would pray near him and steal a look at him. <br/>
When I performed my prayer he looked at me, and when I turned towards <br/>
him he turned away from me. When I had endured much from the harsh¬ <br/>
ness of the Muslims I walked off and climbed over the wall of Abu Qatada’s <br/>
91 x orchard. He was my cousin and the dearest of men to me. I saluted him <br/>
and by God he did not return my salam so I said, ‘O Abu Qatada, I adjure <br/>
you by God, do you not know that I love God and His apostle?’; but he <br/>
answered me not a word. Again I adjured him and he was silent; again, <br/>
and he said, ‘God and His apostle know best.’ At that my eyes swam with <br/>
tears and I jumped up and climbed over the wall. </p>
<p>In the morning I walked in the market and there was one of the Nabati <br/>
traders from Syria who came to sell food in Medina asking for me. When <br/>
he asked for me the people pointed me out to him, and he came and gave <br/>
me a letter from the king of Ghassan which he had written on a piece of <br/>
silk which read as follows: ‘We hear that your master has treated you <br/>
badly. God has not put you in a house of humiliation and loss, so come to <br/>
us and we will provide for you.’ When I read it I thought that this too was <br/>
part of the ordeal. My situation was such that a polytheist hoped to win <br/>
me over; so I took the letter to the oven and burned it. </p>
<p>Thus we went on until forty of the fifty nights had passed and then the <br/>
apostle’s messenger came to me and told me that the apostle ordered that <br/>
I should separate myself from my wife. I asked whether this meant that I <br/>
was to divorce her, but he said No, I was to separate myself and not <br/>
approach her. My two companions received similar orders. I told my wife <br/>
to rejoin her family until such time as God should give a decision in the <br/>
matter. The wife of Hilal came to the apostle and told him that he was an <br/>
old man, lost without a servant, was there any objection to her serving <br/>
him? He said there was not provided that he did not approach her. She <br/>
told the apostle that he never made a movement towards her and that his <br/>
weeping was so prolonged that she feared that he would lose his sight. <br/>
One of my family suggested that I should ask for similar permission from <br/>
the apostle, but I declined to do so because I did not know what he would <br/>
912 say in reply since I was a young man. Ten more nights passed until fifty </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 613 </p>
<p>nights since the apostle had forbidden men to speak to us were complete, </p>
<p>I prayed the morning prayer on the top of one of our houses on the mom <br/>
of the fiftieth night in the way that God had prescribed. The world, <br/>
spacious as it is, closed in on us and my soul was deep distressed. 1 I had <br/>
set up a tent on the top of a crag and I used to stay there when suddenly I <br/>
heard the voice of a crier coming over the top of the crag shouting at the <br/>
top of his voice Good news, Ka b b. Malik!’ I fell down prostrate, knowing <br/>
that relief had come at last. </p>
<p>The apostle announced God’s forgiveness when he prayed the dawn <br/>
prayer and men went off to tell us the good news. They went to my two <br/>
fellows with the news and a man galloped off to me on a horse, and a runner <br/>
from Aslam ran until he came over the mountain, and the voice was quicker <br/>
than the horse. When the man whom I had heard shouting the good news <br/>
came, I tore off my clothes and gave them to him as a reward for good <br/>
tidings, and by God at the time I had no others and had'to borrow more <br/>
and put them on. Then I set off towards the apostle and men met me and <br/>
told me the good news and congratulated me on God’s having forgiven me. </p>
<p>I went into the mosque and there was the apostle surrounded by men. <br/>
Jalha 5, ‘Ubaydullah got up and greeted me and congratulated me, but no <br/>
other muhajir did so. (Ka'b never forgot this action of Talha’s.) </p>
<p>When I saluted the apostle he said as his face shone with joy, ‘This is <br/>
the best day of your life. Good news to you!’ I said, ‘From you or from <br/>
God?’ ‘From God, of course,’ he said. When he told good news his face <br/>
used to be like the moon, and we used to recognize it. When I sat before <br/>
him I told him that as an act of penitence I would give away my property <br/>
as alms to God and His apostle. He told me to keep some of it for that 913 <br/>
would be better for me. I told him that I would keep my share in Khaybar <br/>
booty, and I said, ‘God has saved me through truthfulness, and part of my <br/>
repentance towards God is that I will not speak anything but the truth so <br/>
long as I live; and by God I do not know any man whom God has favoured 2 <br/>
in speaking the truth since I told the apostle that more graciously than He <br/>
favoured me. From the day I told the apostle that to the present day I <br/>
never even purposed a lie, and I hope that God will preserve me for the <br/>
time that remains.’ </p>
<p>God sent down: ‘God has forgiven the prophet and the emigrants and <br/>
the helpers who followed him in the hour of difficulty after the hearts of a <br/>
party of them had almost swerved; then He forgave them. He is kind and <br/>
merciful to them and to the three who were left behind’ as far as the words <br/>
‘And be with the truthful.’ 3 </p>
<p>Ka'b said: ‘God never showed me a greater favour after He had guided <br/>
me to Islam than when I told the apostle the truth that day so that I did not <br/>
lie and perish like those who lied; for God said about those who lied to him <br/>
when He sent down the revelation “They will swear to you by God when </p>

<p>1 Cf. 518. 4. 'tested’ is a possible alternative. </p>
<p>3 Sura 9. 118. </p>
<p>614 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>you return to them that you may turn from them. Do turn from them for <br/>
they are unclean and their resting place is hell, in reward for what they <br/>
have earned. They swear to you that you may be satisfied with them, and <br/>
if you are satisfied with them God is not satisfied with an evil people.’” 1 </p>
<p>We three were kept back from the affair of those from whom the apostle <br/>
accepted an apology when they swore an oath to him and he asked forgive¬ <br/>
ness for them. And the apostle postponed our affair until God gave His <br/>
judgement, and about that God said, ‘And to the three who were left <br/>
behind.’ 2 </p>
<p>When God used the word khullifu it had nothing to do with our holding <br/>
back from the raid, but to his holding us back and postponing our affair <br/>
from those who swore to him and made excuses which he accepted. </p>
<p>914 THE ENVOYS OF THAQlF ACCEPT ISLAM, A.H. 9 </p>
<p>The apostle returned from Tabuk in Ramadan and in that month the <br/>
deputation of Thaqif came to him. </p>
<p>When the apostle came away from them 'Urwa b. Mas'ud al-Thaqafl <br/>
followed him until he caught up with him before he got to Medina, and <br/>
accepted Islam. He asked that he might go back to his people as- a Muslim, <br/>
but the apostle said—so his people say—‘They will kill you,’ for the <br/>
apostle knew the proud spirit of opposition that was in them. 'Urwa said <br/>
that he was dearer to them than their firstborn (866). </p>
<p>He was a man who was loved and obeyed and he went out calling his <br/>
people to Islam and hoping that they would not oppose him because of his <br/>
position among them. When he went up to an upper room and showed <br/>
himself to them after he had invited them to Islam and shown his religion <br/>
to them they shot arrows at him from all directions, and one hit him and <br/>
killed him. The B. Malik allege that one of their men killed him; his name <br/>
was Aus b. 'Auf, brother of B. Salim b. Malik. The Ahlaf allege that one <br/>
of their men from B. 'Attab b. Malik called Wahb b. Jabir killed him. It <br/>
was said to 'Urwa, ‘What do you think about your death?’ He said, ‘It is <br/>
a gift which God has honoured me with and a martyrdom which God has <br/>
led me to. I am like the martyrs who were killed with the apostle before <br/>
he went away from you; so bury me with them.’ They did bury him with <br/>
them and they allege that the apostle said about him, ‘Among his people <br/>
he is like the hero of Ya Sin among his people.’ 3 </p>
<p>Thaqif delayed some months after the killing of 'Urwa. Then they took <br/>
counsel among themselves and decided that they could not fight the Arabs <br/>
all around them, who had paid homage and accepted Islam. </p>
<p>Ya'qub b. 'Utba b. al-Mughlra b. al-Akhnas told me that 'Amr b. <br/>
Umayya, brother of B. Tlaj, was not on speaking terms with 'Abdu Yalll b. <br/>
'Amr and there was bad feeling between them. 'Amr was a most crafty <br/>
man and he walked to ‘Abdu Yalll and entered his dwelling and sent word <br/>
1 Sura 9. 96. 2 Sura 9. 119. 3 Cf. Sura 36. 19. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 615 </p>
<p>to him to come out to him. 'Abdu Yalll expressed great surprise that 'Amr 915 <br/>
who was so carefid of his life should come to him, so he came out, and <br/>
when he saw him he welcomed him. 'Amr said to him: ‘We are in an <br/>
impasse. You have seen how the affair of this man has progressed. All <br/>
the Arabs have accepted Islam and you lack the power to fight them, so <br/>
look to your case.’ Thereupon Thaqif took counsel and said one to <br/>
another, ‘Don’t you see that your herds are not safe; none of you can go out <br/>
without being cut off.’ So after conferring together they decided to send a <br/>
man to the apostle as they had sent 'Urwa. They spoke to 'Abdu Yalll, <br/>
who was a contemporary of 'Urwa, and laid the plan before him, but he <br/>
refused to act, fearing that on his return he would be treated as 'Urwa w r as. </p>
<p>He said that he would not go unless they sent some men with him. They <br/>
decided to send two men from al-Ahlaf and three from B. Malik, six in all. <br/>
They sent with 'Abdu Yalll, al-Hakam b. 'Amr b. Wahb b. Mu'attib, and <br/>
Shurahbll b. Ghaylan b. Salima b. Mu'attib; and from B. Malik, 'Uthman <br/>
b. Abu’I-'As b. Bishr b. 'Abdu Duhman, brother of B. Yasar, and Aus b. </p>
<p>'Auf, brother of B. Salim b. 'Auf, and Numayr b. Kharasha b. Rabi'a, <br/>
brother of B. al-Harith. 'Abdu Yalll went with them as leader in charge of <br/>
the affair. He took them with him only out of fear of meeting the same <br/>
fate as 'Urwa and in order that each man on his return could secure the <br/>
attention of his clan. </p>
<p>When they approached Medina and halted at Qanat they met there al- <br/>
Mughlra b. Shu'ba whose turn it was to pasture the camels of the apostle’s <br/>
companions, for the companions took this duty in turn. When he saw <br/>
them he left the camels with the Thaqafis and jumped up to run to give the <br/>
apostle the good new r s of their coining. Abu Bakr met him before he could <br/>
get to the apostle and he told him that riders of Thaqif had come to make 916 <br/>
their submission and accept Islam on the apostle’s conditions provided <br/>
that they could get a document guaranteeing their people and their land <br/>
and animals. Abu Bakr implored al-Mughlra to let him be the first to tell <br/>
the apostle the news and he agreed, so Abu Bakr went in and told the <br/>
apostle while al-Mughlra rejoined his companions and brought the camels <br/>
back. He taught them how to salute the apostle, for they were used to the <br/>
salutation of paganism. When they came to the apostle he pitched a tent <br/>
for them near his mosque, so they allege. Khalid b. Sa'Id b. al-'As acted <br/>
as intermediary between them and the apostle until they got their docu¬ <br/>
ment; it was he who actually wrote it. They would not eat the food which <br/>
came to them from the apostle until Khalid ate some and until they <br/>
had accepted Islam and had got their document. </p>
<p>Among the things they asked the apostle was that they should be <br/>
allowed to retain their idol AI-Lat undestroyed for three years. The <br/>
apostle refused, and they continued to ask him for a year or two, and he <br/>
refused; finally they asked for a month after their return home; but he <br/>
refused to agree to any set time. All that they wanted as they were trying <br/>
to show was to be safe from their fanatics and women and children by </p>
<p>616 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>leaving her, and they did not want to frighten their people by destroying <br/>
her until they had accepted Islam. The apostle refused this, but he sent <br/>
Abu Sufyan b. Harb and al-Mughira b. Shu'ba to destroy her. They had <br/>
also asked that he would excuse them from prayer and that they should not <br/>
have to break their idols with their own hands. The apostle said: ‘We <br/>
excuse you from breaking your idols with your own hands, but as for <br/>
prayer there is no good in a religion which has no prayers.’ They said that <br/>
they would perform them though it was demeaning. </p>
<p>When they had accepted Islam and the apostle had given them their <br/>
9 J 7 document he appointed 'Uthman b. Abu’l- f As over them although he was <br/>
the youngest of them. This was because he was the most zealous in study¬ <br/>
ing Islam and learning the Quran. Abu Bakr had told the apostle this. </p>
<p>Tsa b. ‘Abdullah b. 'Atlya b. Sufyan b. Rabi'a al-Thaqafi from one of <br/>
the deputation told me: Bilal used to come to us when we had become <br/>
Muslims and we fasted with the apostle for the rest of Ramadan, and bring, <br/>
our supper and our breakfast from the apostle. He would come to us in <br/>
the morning twilight and we would say ‘We see that the dawn has risen.’ <br/>
He would say, ‘I left the apostle eating at daybreak, so as to make the dawn <br/>
meal later’and he would bring our evening meal and we would say, ‘We <br/>
see that the sun has not entirely vanished,’ and he would say, ‘I did not <br/>
come to you until the apostle had eaten.’ Then he would put his hand in <br/>
the dish and eat from it (867). </p>
<p>Sa'id b. Abu Hind from Mutarrif b. 'Abdullah b. al-Shakhkhir from <br/>
'Uthman b. Abu’l-'As said: The last thing the apostle enjoined on me <br/>
when he sent me to Thaqif was to be brief in prayer, to measure men by <br/>
their weakest members; for there were old and young, sick and infirm <br/>
among them. </p>
<p>When they had accomplished their task and had set out to return to their <br/>
country the apostle sent with them Abu Sufyan and al-Mughira to destroy <br/>
the idol. They travelled with the deputation and when they neared al- <br/>
Ta’if, al-Mughira wanted to send on Abu Sufyan in advance. The latter <br/>
refused and told him to go to his people while he stayed in his property in <br/>
Dhu’l-Haram. 2 When al-Mughira entered he went up to the idol and <br/>
struck it with a pickaxe. His people the B. Mu'attib stood in front of him <br/>
fearing that he would be shot or killed as 'Urwa had been. The women of <br/>
918 Thaqif came out with their heads uncovered bewailing her and saying: </p>
<p>O weep for our protector <br/>
Poltroons would neglect her <br/>
Whose swords need a corrector (868). </p>
<p>Abu Sufyan, as al-Mughira smote her with the axe, said ‘Alas for you, <br/>
alas!’ When al-Mughira had destroyed her and taken what was on her and </p>

<p>The Life of Muhammad 617 </p>
<p>her jewels he sent for Abu Sufyan when her jewellery and gold and beads <br/>
had been collected. </p>
<p>Now Abu Mulayh b. 'Urwa and Qarib b. al-Aswad had come to the <br/>
apostle before the Thaqif deputation when 'Urwa was killed, desiring to <br/>
separate themselves from Thaqif and to have nothing to do with them. <br/>
When they became Muslims the apostle said to them, ‘Take as friends <br/>
whom you will,’ and they said, ‘We choose God and His apostle.’ The <br/>
apostle said, ‘and your maternal uncle Abu Sufyan b. Harb,’ and they said, <br/>
‘Even so.’ </p>
<p>When the people of al-Ta’if had accepted Islam and the apostle had sent <br/>
Abu Sufyan and al-Mughira to destroy the idol, Abu Mulayh b. 'Urwa <br/>
asked the apostle to settle a debt his father had incurred from the property <br/>
of the idol. The apostle agreed and Qarib b. al-Aswad asked for the same <br/>
privilege for his father. Now 'Urwa and al-Aswad were full brothers. The <br/>
apostle said, ‘But al-Aswad died a polytheist.’ He answered, ‘But you will <br/>
be doing a favour to a Muslim a near relation,’ meaning himself; ‘the debt <br/>
is only incumbent on me and from me it is required.’ The apostle ordered <br/>
Abu Sufyan to satisfy the debts of 'Urwa and al-Aswad from the property <br/>
of the idol, and when al-Mughira had collected its money he told Abu <br/>
Sufyan that the apostle had ordered him to satisfy these debts thus, and he <br/>
did so. </p>
<p>The text of the document the apostle wrote for them runs: ‘In the name <br/>
of God the Compassionate the Merciful. From Muhammad the prophet, <br/>
the apostle of God, to the believers: The acacia trees of Wajj 1 and its game <br/>
are not to be injured. Anyone found doing this will be scourged and his <br/>
garments confiscated. If he repeats the offence he will be seized and <br/>
brought to the prophet Muhammad. This is the order of the prophet <br/>
Muhammad, the apostle of God.’ Khalid b. Sa'id has written by the order <br/>
of the apostle Muhammad b. Abdullah, so let none repeat the offence to his 919 <br/>
own injury in what the apostle of God Muhammad has ordered, </p>
<p>ABU BAKR LEADS THE PILGRIMAGE, A.H. 9 </p>
<p>The apostle remained there for the rest of the month of Ramadan and <br/>
Shawwal and Dhu’l-Qa'da. Then he sent Abu Bakr in command of the <br/>
hajj in the year 9 to enable the Muslims to perform their hajj while the <br/>
polytheists were at their pilgrimage stations. Abu Bakr and the Muslims <br/>
duly departed. </p>
<p>A discharge came down permitting the breaking of the agreement <br/>
between the apostle and the polytheists that none should be kept back from <br/>
the temple when he came to it, and that none need fear during the sacred <br/>
month. That was a general agreement between him and the polytheists; <br/>
meanwhile there were particular agreements between the apostle and the <br/>
Arab tribes for specified terms. And there came down about it and about </p>
<p>1 A place in al-'J’a’if. </p>
<p>618 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>the disaffected who held back from him in the raid on Tabuk, and about <br/>
what they said (revelations) in which God uncovered the secret thoughts <br/>
of people who were dissembling. We know the names of some of them, of <br/>
others we do not. He said: 1 ‘A discharge from God and His apostle <br/>
towards those polytheists with whom you made a treaty,’ i.e. those poly¬ <br/>
theists with whom you made a general agreement. ‘So travel through the <br/>
land for four months and know that you cannot escape God and that God <br/>
will put the unbelievers to shame. And a proclamation from God and His <br/>
apostle to men on the day of the greater pilgrimage that God and His <br/>
9 2o apostle are free from obligation to the polytheists,’ i.e. after this pilgrimage. <br/>
‘So if you repent it will be better for you; and if you turn back know that <br/>
you cannot escape God. Inform those who disbelieve, about a painful <br/>
punishment except those polytheists with whom you have made a treaty,’ <br/>
i.e. the special treaty for a specified term, ‘since they have not come short <br/>
in anything in regard to you and have not helped anyone against you. So <br/>
fulfil your treaty with them to their allotted time. God loves the pious. <br/>
And when the sacred months are passed,’ He means the four which he fixed <br/>
as their time, ‘then kill the polytheists wherever you find them, and seize <br/>
them and besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush. But if <br/>
they repent and perform prayer and pay the poor-tax, then let them go <br/>
their way. God is forgiving, merciful. If one of the polytheists,’ i.e. one <br/>
of those whom I have ordered you to kill, ‘asks your protection, give it him <br/>
so that he may hear the word of God; then convey him to his place of <br/>
safety. That is because they are a people who do not know.’ </p>
<p>Then He said: ‘How can there be for the polytheists’ with whom you had <br/>
a general agreement that they should not put you in fear and that you <br/>
would not put them in fear neither in the holy places nor in the holy <br/>
months ‘a treaty with God and His apostle except for those with whom you <br/>
made a treaty at the sacred mosque?’ They were the tribes of B. Bakr who <br/>
had entered into an agreement with Quraysh on the day of al-Hudaybiya <br/>
up to the time agreed between the apostle and Quraysh. It was only this <br/>
clan of Quraysh who had broken it. They were al-Dll of B. Bakr b. Wa’il <br/>
who had entered into the agreement of Quraysh. So he was ordered to <br/>
fulfil the agreement with those of B. Bakr who had not broken it, up to their <br/>
allotted time. ‘So long as they are true to you be true to them. God loves <br/>
the pious.’ </p>
<p>Then He said: ‘And how, if when they have the upper hand of you,’ i.e. <br/>
the polytheists who have no agreement up to a time under the general <br/>
agreement with the polytheists ‘they regard not pact or compact in regard <br/>
to you’ (869). </p>
<p>92.1 ‘They satisfy you with their lips while their hearts refuse. Most of them <br/>
are wrongdoers. They have sold the revelations of God for a low price <br/>
and debarred (men) from His way. Evil is that which they are wont to do. <br/>
They observe neither pact nor compact with a believer. Those are the <br/>
1 Sura 9. This- chapter is a commentary on it. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 619 </p>
<p>transgressors,’ i.e. they have transgressed against you. ‘But if they repent <br/>
and perform prayer and pay the poor tax, then they are your brothers in <br/>
religion. We make clear the revelations for a people who have knowledge.’ </p>
<p>Hakim b. Hakim b. 'Abbad b. Hunayf from Abu Ja'far Muhammad b. </p>
<p>‘AH told me that when the discharge came down to the apostle after he had <br/>
sent Abu Bakr to superintend the hajj, someone expressed the wish that he <br/>
would send news of it to Abu Bakr. He said, ‘None shall transmit it from <br/>
me but a man of my own house.’ Then he summoned 'All and said: ‘Take <br/>
this section from the beginning of “The Discharge” and proclaim it to the <br/>
people on the day of sacrifice when they assemble at Mina. No unbeliever <br/>
shall enter Paradise, and no polytheist shall make pilgrimage after this <br/>
year, and no naked person shall circumambulate the temple. He who has 922 <br/>
an agreement with the apostle has it for his appointed time (only). 'All <br/>
went forth on the apostle’s slit-eared camel and overtook Abu Bakr on the <br/>
way. When Abu Bakr saw him he asked whether he had come to give <br/>
orders or to convey them. He said ‘to convey them.’ They went on <br/>
together and Abu Bakr superintended the hajj , the Arabs in that year doing <br/>
as they had done in the heathen period. When the day of sacrifice came <br/>
All arose and proclaimed what the apostle had ordered him to say, and he <br/>
gave the men a period of four months from the date of the proclamation to <br/>
return to their place of safety or their country; afterwards there was to be <br/>
no treaty or compact except for one with whom the apostle had an agree¬ <br/>
ment for a period, and he could have it for that period. After that year no <br/>
polytheist went on pilgrimage or circumambulated the temple naked. <br/>
Then the two of them returned to the apostle. This was the Discharge in <br/>
regard to the polytheists who had a general agreement, and those who had <br/>
a respite for the specified time. </p>
<p>Then the apostle gave orders to fight the polytheists who had broken the <br/>
special agreement as well as those who had a general agreement after the <br/>
four months which had been given them as a fixed time, save that if any one <br/>
of them showed hostility he should be killed for it. And He said, ‘Will you <br/>
not fight a people who broke their oaths and thought to drive out the <br/>
apostle and attacked you first ? Do you fear them when God is more worthy <br/>
to be feared if you are believers? Fight them! God will punish them by <br/>
your hands, and put them to shame and give you the victory" over them and <br/>
will heal the breasts of a believing people, and He will remove the anger of <br/>
their hearts and God will relent,’ i.e. after that ‘towards whom He will, for <br/>
God is knowing, wise.’ ‘Or do you think that you will be left (idle) when <br/>
God does not yet know those of you who bestir yourselves and choose none <br/>
for friend but God and His apostle and the believers ? God is informed <br/>
about what you do’ (870). </p>
<p>Then He mentioned the words of Quraysh, ‘We are the people of the <br/>
sanctuary, the waterers of the pilgrims, and the tenders of this temple and <br/>
none is superior to us,’ and He said: ‘He only shall tend God’s sanctuaries 923 <br/>
who believes in God and the last day,’ i.e. your tending was not thus. Only </p>
<p>620 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>those who tend God's sanctuaries means tend them as they ought to be <br/>
tended ‘who believes in God and the last day and performs prayer and pay£ <br/>
the poor tax and fears only God,’ i.e. those are its tenders, ‘perhaps those <br/>
may be the rightly guided.' ‘Perhaps' coming from God means a fact. Then <br/>
he said: ‘ Would you make the watering of the pilgrims and the tending of the <br/>
sacred mosque equal to one who believes in God and the last day and <br/>
fights in the way of God ? They are not equal with God.’ </p>
<p>Then comes the story of their enemy until he arrives at the mention of <br/>
Hunayn and what happened there and their turning back from their <br/>
enemy and how God sent down help after they had abandoned one <br/>
another. Then He said (v. 28): ‘The polytheists are nothing but unclean, <br/>
so let them not approach the sacred mosque after this year of theirs, and if <br/>
you fear poverty’ that was because the people said ‘the markets will be cut <br/>
off from us, trade will be destroyed, and w r e shall lose the good things we <br/>
used to enjoy,’ and God said, ‘If you fear poverty God will enrich you <br/>
from His bounty,’ i.e. in some other way, ‘if He will. He is knowing, wise. <br/>
Fight those who do not believe in God and the last day and forbid not that <br/>
which God and His apostle have forbidden and follow not the religion of <br/>
truth from among those who have been given the scripture until they pay, <br/>
the poll tax out of hand being humbled,’ i.e. as a compensation for w r hat you <br/>
fear to lose by the closing of the markets. God gave them compensation <br/>
for what He cut off from them in their former polytheism by what He gave <br/>
them by way of poll tax from the people of scripture. </p>
<p>Then He mentioned the two peoples of scripture with their evil and their <br/>
lies against Him until the words ‘Many of the rabbis and monks devour <br/>
men’s wealth wickedly and turn men from the way of God. Those who <br/>
hoard up gold and silver and do not spend it in the way of God, announce <br/>
to them a painful punishment.’ </p>
<p>Then He mentioned the fixing of the sacred months and the innovations <br/>
of the Arabs in the matter. Nasi' means making profane months which <br/>
God has’declared holy and vice versa. ‘The number of the months with <br/>
924 God is twelve in the book of God on the day He created heaven and earth. <br/>
Four of them are sacred; that is the standing religion, so wrong not your¬ <br/>
selves therein,’ i.e. do not make the sacred profane or the profane sacred <br/>
as the polytheists did. ‘Postponement (of a sacred month)’ which they <br/>
used to practise ‘is excess of infidelity whereby those who disbelieve are <br/>
misled; they allow it one year and forbid it another year that they may <br/>
make up the number of the months which God has made sacred so that <br/>
they allow that "which God has forbidden, the evil of their deeds seeming <br/>
good to them. But God does not guide a disbelieving people.’ </p>
<p>Then He mentioned Tabuk and how the Muslims were weighed down <br/>
by it and exaggerated the difficulty of attacking the Byzantines when the <br/>
apostle called them to fight them; and the disaffection of some; then how <br/>
the apostle upbraided them for their behaviour in Islam. God said, ‘O you <br/>
who believe, what was the matter with you that when it was said to you, </p>
<p>621 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Go forth in the way of God you were weighed down to the earth’ then as <br/>
far as His words ‘ He will punish you with a painful punishment and choose <br/>
a people other than you’ to the words ‘if you do not help him still God <br/>
helped him when those w r ho disbelieve drove him out the second of two <br/>
when the twain were in the cave.’ </p>
<p>Then He said to His prophet, mentioning the disaffected: ‘Had it been <br/>
a near adventure and a short journey they would have followed you, but <br/>
the long distance weighed upon them. And they will swear by God, Had <br/>
we been able w T e would have set forth with you. They destroy themselves, </p>
<p>God knowing that they are liars,’ i.e. that they were able. ‘May God forgive <br/>
you. Why did you give them leave (to stay behind) before those who told <br/>
the truth were plain to you and you knew the liars?’ as far as the words <br/>
‘Had they gone forth with you they would have contributed naught but <br/>
trouble and have hurried about among you seeking to cause sedition among <br/>
you there being among you some who would have listened to them’ (871). </p>
<p>Among the men of high standing who asked his permission (to stay be¬ <br/>
hind) according to my information were ‘Abdullah b. Ubayy b. Salul and <br/>
al-Jadd b. Qays. They were nobles among their people and God kept them 925 <br/>
back because He knew that if they went forth with him they would cause <br/>
disorder in his army, for in the army were men who loved them and would <br/>
obey them in anything they asked because of their high standing among <br/>
them. God said: ‘And among them are some who would have listened to <br/>
them, and God knows about the evil-doers. In the past they sought to <br/>
cause sedition,’ i.e. before they asked your permission, ‘and overturned <br/>
your affairs,’ i.e. to draw away your companions from you and to frustrate <br/>
your affair ‘until the truth came and God’s command became manifest <br/>
though they were averse’. Of them is he who said, Give me permission <br/>
(to stay behind) and tempt me not. Have they not fallen into temptation <br/>
already ?’ The one who said that according to what we were told was al- <br/>
Jadd b. Qays, brother of B. Salima, when the apostle called him to war <br/>
with the Byzantines. Then the account goes on to the words ‘If they were <br/>
to find a refuge or caverns or a place to enter they would have turned to it <br/>
with all speed. And of them is he who defamed you in the matter of alms. </p>
<p>If they are given some they are content; but if they are not given some they <br/>
are enraged,’ i.e. their whole aim, their satisfaction, and their anger, are <br/>
concerned with their worldly life. </p>
<p>Then He explained and specified to whom alms should be given: ‘Alms <br/>
are only for the poor and needy and the collectors of it and for those whose <br/>
hearts are to be won, and to free captives and debtors, and for the way of <br/>
God and for the wayfarer as an ordinance from God and God is knowing, <br/>
wise.’ </p>
<p>Then He mentioned their duplicity and their vexing the apostle and <br/>
said: ‘And of them are those who vex the prophet and say, He is an ear. </p>
<p>Say: an ear of good for you, who believes in God and is faithful to the <br/>
believers and a mercy for those of you who believe. There is a painful </p>
<p>622 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>punishment for those who vex God’s apostle.’ According to my informa¬ <br/>
tion the man who said those words was Nabtal b. al-Harith, brother of B. <br/>
'Amr b. 'Auf, and this verse came down about him because he used to say <br/>
‘Muhammad is only an ear. If anyone tells him a thing he believes it.’ <br/>
God said, ‘Say: An ear of good to you,’ i.e. he hears good and believes it. </p>
<p>Then He said, ‘They swear by God to you to please you, but God and <br/>
His apostle have more right that they should please Him if they are be¬ <br/>
lievers.’ 1 Then He said, ‘If you ask them they will say We were but talking <br/>
and jesting. Say: Do you scoff at God and His signs and His apostle?* as </p>
<p>926 far as the w r ords ‘If We pardon a party of you We will punish a party.’ The <br/>
one who said these words was Wadi'a b. Thabit, brother of B. Umayya b. <br/>
Zayd of B. 'Amr b. 'Auf. The one who was pardoned, according to my <br/>
information, was Mukhashshin b. Humayyir al-Ashja'I, an ally of B. <br/>
Salima, because he disapproved of what he heard them saying. </p>
<p>The description of them continues to the words, ‘O prophet, fight the <br/>
unbelievers and disaffected, and deal roughly with them. Their abode is <br/>
hell, an evil resting-place. They sw r ear by God that they did not say it but <br/>
they did say the word of unbelief and disbelieved after their Islam and <br/>
planned what they could not attain. They sought revenge only because <br/>
God and His apostle had enriched them from His bounty' to the words ‘no <br/>
friend and no helper.’ The one who said those words was al-Julas b. <br/>
Suwayd b. Samit, and a man of his family called 'Umayr b. Sa'd reported <br/>
them and he denied that he had said them and swore an oath by God. But <br/>
when the Quran came dowm concerning them he repented and changed <br/>
his mind. His repentance and his state became excellent as I have heard. </p>
<p>Then He said, ‘And of them is he who made a covenant w'ith God: If He <br/>
gives us of His bounty we will give alms and become of the righteous.’ <br/>
The ones who made a covenant with God were Tha'laba b. Hatib and <br/>
Mu'attib b. Qushayr, both of B. 'Amr b. 'Auf. </p>
<p>Then He said, ‘Those who defame such of the believers as give freely in <br/>
alms and such as can only give their efforts and scoff at them, God will <br/>
scoff at them and they will have a painful punishment,’ The believers who <br/>
freely gave alms w r ere 'Abdu’l-Rahman b. 'Auf and 'Asim b. 'Adly, brother <br/>
of B. 'Ajlan, because the apostle incited and urged men to almsgiving. <br/>
'Abdu’l-Rahman arose and gave 4,000 dirhams, and 'Asim arose and gave <br/>
100 loads of dates, and they defamed them and said, ‘This is nothing <br/>
but ostentation.’ The man who gave in alms all he could was Abu 'Aqil, <br/>
brother of B. Unayf, who brought a measure of dates and cast it all into <br/>
the alms. They laughed at him saying, ‘God can do without Abu 'Aqil’s <br/>
paltry measure.’ </p>
<p>Then He mentioned what they said one to another when the apostle <br/>
ordered war and the expedition to Tabuk in great heat and sterile condi- </p>
<p>927 tions. ‘They said, Go not forth in the heat. Say: The fire of hell is much </p>
<p>1 The syntax of this verse is forced and it is probable that some early scribe wrote r varasu- <br/>
luhu mechanically. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 623 </p>
<p>hotter did you but understand. But let them laugh a little and weep much’ <br/>
as far as the words ‘and let not their wealth and children astonish you.’ </p>
<p>Al-Zuhri from 'Ubaydullah b. 'Abdullah b. 'Utba from b. 'Abbas said: <br/>
I heard 'Umar saying, ‘When 'Abdullah b. Ubayy died the apostle was <br/>
called to pray over him; and when he went and stood by him about to <br/>
pray I changed my position so as to confront him and said “Are you going <br/>
to pray over God's enemy 'Abdullah b. Ubayy, the man who said so-and-so <br/>
on such-and-such occasions ?” The apostle smiled w'hen I had made a long <br/>
story and said, “Get behind me, 'Umar. I have been given the choice and <br/>
I have chosen. It was said to me, ‘Ask pardon for them or ask it not. If <br/>
you ask pardon for them seventy times God will not pardon them.’ Did <br/>
I know that if I added to the seventy he would be forgiven I would add <br/>
thereto.” Then he prayed over him and walked with him till he stood over <br/>
his grave until he was disposed of. I was astonished at myself and my bold¬ <br/>
ness when God and His apostle know best. It was not long before these <br/>
two verses came down “And never pray for any one of them who dies <br/>
and do not stand by his grave for they disbelieved in God and His apostle <br/>
and died as evil-doers.” Afterwards the apostle never prayed over a <br/>
disaffected person until the day of his death.’ </p>
<p>Then He said: ‘And when a sura is sent down: Believe in God and <br/>
strive along with His apostle, men of wealth among them asked your <br/>
permission (to stay behind).’ Ibn Ubayy was one of them and God <br/>
upbraided him for it, then He said: ‘But the apostle and those who believe <br/>
with him strive with their wealth and their lives; for them are the good <br/>
things; they are the successful. God has prepared for them gardens <br/>
beneath which rivers flow wherein they shall abide for ever; that is the <br/>
great triumph. And the excuse-offering Bedouin came to ask leave and those <br/>
who disbelieved God and His apostle stayed at home’ to the end of the <br/>
account. The men with excuses so I have heard were a number of B. <br/>
Ghifar among whom was Khufaf b. Ayma’ b. Rahada; He goes on with the <br/>
story of these to the words ‘nor to those w r ho when they came to you to <br/>
mount them you said I cannot find a beast on which to mount you, turned <br/>
back, their eyes flowing with tears for grief that they could not find the <br/>
wherewithal to spend.’ Those were the weepers. </p>
<p>Then He said: ‘The way (of blame) is only against those who asked <br/>
leave, they being rich. They wanted to be with the women. God sealed <br/>
their hearts and they do not know.’ The khawdiif were the women. Then <br/>
He mentioned their oath and their excuse to the Muslims and said, <br/>
‘Turn away from them’ to His words ‘And if you are satisfied with them <br/>
God will not be satisfied with an evil people.’ </p>
<p>Then He mentioned the Bedouin and the disaffected among them and <br/>
how they waited for (the discomfiture of) the apostle and the believers: <br/>
‘And of the Bedouin there is he who regards what is spent,’ i.e. of the alms <br/>
or expenses in the way of God ‘as a tax and awaits evil fortune for you. <br/>
The evil fortune will be theirs and God is hearing, knowing.’ </p>
<p>624 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Then He mentioned the sincere and faithful Bedouin among them and <br/>
said: ‘And of the Bedouin there is he who believes in God and the last <br/>
day and regards what he spends and the prayers of the apostle as accep¬ <br/>
table offerings with God. It is an acceptable offering for them.’ </p>
<p>Then He mentioned the first emigrants and helpers and their merit and <br/>
the goodly reward which God promised them. Then he joined with them <br/>
their later followers in goodness and He said, ‘God is pleased with them <br/>
and they are pleased with Him.’ Then He said: ‘And of the Bedouin <br/>
round you there are the disaffected and of the people of Medina there are <br/>
those who are stubborn in disaffection,’ i.e. persist in it and refuse to be <br/>
otherwise; ‘we shall punish them twice.’ The punishment with which <br/>
God threatened them twice according to my information is their grief <br/>
over their position in Islam and their inward rage at not getting a (heavenly) <br/>
reward; then their punishment in the grave when they get there; then the <br/>
great punishment to which they will be brought, the punishment of hell <br/>
eternally. Then He said: ‘And there are others who acknowledged their <br/>
faults. They mixed a good deed with another that was bad; perhaps God <br/>
will relent towards them, for He is forgiving, merciful.’ </p>
<p>Then He said, ‘Take alms from their wealth wherewith to purify and <br/>
cleanse them’ to the end of the passage. Then He said: ‘And there are <br/>
others who are postponed to God’s decree; either He will punish them or <br/>
relent towards them.’ They are the three who were left in abeyance and <br/>
the apostle postponed their case until their forgiveness came from God. </p>
<p>929 Then He said, ‘And as for those who chose a mosque out of opposition’ <br/>
to the end of the passage. Then He said: ‘God has bought from the <br/>
believers their lives and their wealth for the Garden that will be theirs.’ <br/>
Then comes the narrative dealing with Tabuk to the end of the chapter. </p>
<p>In the time of the prophet and afterwards Bara’a was called al-Muba- <br/>
'thira 1 because it laid bare the secret thoughts of men. Tabuk was the last <br/>
raid that the apostle made. </p>
<p>THE POETRY OF HASSAN ENUMERATING THE BATTLES </p>
<p>Hassan b. Thabit, enumerating the battles and campaigns in which the <br/>
Ansar fought in company with the apostle, said: (872) </p>
<p>Am I not the best of Ma'add in family and tribe 2 <br/>
If all of them be reckoned and counted ? </p>
<p>A people all of whom witnessed Badr with the apostle <br/>
Neither falling short nor deserting. </p>
<p>They gave him their fealty, not one betrayed it, </p>
<p>And there was no deceit in their plighted word. </p>
<p>On the day when in the glen of Uhud </p>
<p>1 Cf. Suras 82. 4 and 100. 9. </p>
<p>2 S. explains that Hassan who was not of Ma'add means men in general and says ‘Ma'add* <br/>
because of their great number. </p>
<p>625 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Well-aimed blows blazing like a hot fire met them </p>
<p>And the day of Dhu Qarad when dust rose above them as they rode <br/>
They did not flinch nor fear. </p>
<p>At Dhu 1 - Ushayra they overrode them with the apostle <br/>
Armed with sword and spear. </p>
<p>At Waddan they drove out its people <br/>
Galloping along till hill and mountain stopped us. </p>
<p>And the night when they sought their enemy for God’s sake <br/>
(And God will reward them for what they did). </p>
<p>And the raid on Najd, where with the apostle <br/>
They gained much spoil and booty. </p>
<p>And the night in Hunayn when they fought with him <br/>
He gave them a second taste of combat. </p>
<p>And the raid of al-Qa' when we scattered the enemy <br/>
As camels are scattered before their drinking-place. </p>
<p>They were the people who paid him homage </p>
<p>To the point of war—they succoured him and left him not. o 10 </p>
<p>In the raid on Mecca they were on guard among his troops <br/>
Neither light-minded nor hasty. </p>
<p>At Khaybar they were in his squadron <br/>
Each man walking like a hero facing death <br/>
With swords quivering in their right hands <br/>
Sometimes bent through striking, sometimes straight. </p>
<p>The day the apostle went to Tabuk seeking God’s reward <br/>
They were his first standard-bearers. </p>
<p>They had the conduct of war if it seemed good to them <br/>
Until advance or retreat seemed the best. </p>
<p>Those are the people, the prophet’s Ansar, </p>
<p>And they are my people-to them I belong when my descent is <br/>
searched. </p>
<p>They died honourably, faith unbroken, </p>
<p>And when they were killed it was for God’s sake (873). </p>
<p>Hassan also said: </p>
<p>We were kings of men before Muhammad <br/>
And when Islam came we had the superiority. </p>
<p>God the only God honoured us with </p>
<p>Bygone days that have no parallel </p>
<p>In our help to God and His apostle and His religion, </p>
<p>And God has given us a name which has no equal. </p>
<p>Those people of mine are the best of all people. </p>
<p>Whatever is counted good my people are worthy of it. </p>
<p>They surpass all their predecessors in generosity <br/>
And the way to their generosity is never barred. </p>
<p>When men come to their assemblies they do not behave unseemly </p>

<p>Nor are they mean when asked for a gift. </p>
<p>They are inimitable in war and peace. </p>
<p>To fight them is death; to make peace ease. </p>
<p>Their sojourner’s house is high and inaccessible. </p>
<p>While staying with us he enjoys respect and hospitality. </p>
<p>If one of them assumes a debt he pays it <br/>
Without defaulting or running into debt. </p>
<p>He who speaks speaks the truth, </p>
<p>Their clemency is constant, their judgement just. </p>
<p>He whom the Muslims trusted while he lived 1 <br/>
And he whom the angels 2 washed of his impurity were of us (874). </p>
<p>Hassan also said: </p>
<p>These are my people if you ask, </p>
<p>Generous when a guest arrives. </p>
<p>Large are the cooking-pots for the gamesters <br/>
Wherein they cook the fat-humped camels. </p>
<p>They give the sojourner a life of plenty <br/>
And protect their friend when he is wronged. </p>
<p>They were kings in their lands, </p>
<p>They call for the sword when injustice is flagrant. 3 <br/>
They -were kings over men—never by others <br/>
Have they been ruled even for a short time. </p>
<p>Tell 4 about 'Ad and its peoples: </p>
<p>Of Thamud and the survivors of Iram, </p>
<p>Of Yathrib where they had built forts among the palms <br/>
And cattle were housed there, </p>
<p>Watering camels which the Jews trained <br/>
Saying, Off with you, and Come! </p>
<p>They had what they wanted of wine and pleasure, </p>
<p>An easy life free of care. </p>
<p>We came to them with our equipment <br/>
On our white war-loving camels; </p>
<p>Beside them we led war-horses <br/>
Covered with thick leather. </p>
<p>When we halted on the sides of Sirar 5 <br/>
And made fast the saddles with twisted ropes <br/>
They were scared by the speed of the horses <br/>
And the sudden attack from the rear. </p>
<p>They fled swiftly in terror </p>
<p>As we came on them like lions of the jungle </p>

<p>62B The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>In deciding their attitude to Islam the Arabs were only waiting to see <br/>
what happened to this clan of Quraysh and the apostle. For Quraysh <br/>
were the leaders and guides of men, the people of the sacred temple, <br/>
and the pure stock of Ishmael son of Abraham; and the leading Arabs <br/>
did not contest this. It was Quraysh who had declared war on the apostle <br/>
and opposed him; and when Mecca was occupied and Quraysh became <br/>
subject to him and he subdued it to Islam, and the Arabs knew that they <br/>
could not fight the apostle or display enmity towards him they entered <br/>
into God’s religion ‘in batches’ as God said, coming to him from all <br/>
directions. God said to His prophet: ‘When God’s help came and the <br/>
victory, and you saw men entering into God’s religion in batches, then <br/>
glorify God with praise and ask His pardon for He is most forgiving, <br/>
i.e. praise God for His having made your religion victorious, and ask His <br/>
pardon, for He is most forgiving. </p>
<p>THE COMING OF THE DEPUTATION OF BANtj TAMIM </p>
<p>Then deputations of Arabs came to the apostle. There came to him <br/>
'Utarid b. Hajib b. Zurara b. ‘Udus al-Tamiml among the nobles of B. <br/>
Tamlm including al-Aqra' b. Habis and al-Zibriqan b. Badr one of B. <br/>
Sa'd, and 'Amr b. al Ahtam and al-Habhab b. Zayd (877). </p>
<p>934 And in the deputation of B. Tamim were Nu'aym b. Yazid and Qays b. <br/>
al-Harith and Qays b. ‘Asirn brother of B. Sa’d with a great deputation <br/>
from B. Tamim (878). With them was ‘Uyayna b. Hisn b. Hudhayfa b. <br/>
Badr al-Fazari. </p>
<p>Al-Aqra’ and 'Uyayna had been with the apostle at the occupation of <br/>
Mecca and Hunayn and al-Ta if, and when the deputation came they were <br/>
among them. When the deputation entered the mosque they called out to <br/>
the apostle who was behind in his private apartments, ‘Come out to us, <br/>
Muhammad!’ This loud call annoyed the apostle and he came out to them, <br/>
and they said, ‘Muhammad, we have come to compete with you in boast¬ <br/>
ing, so give permission to our poet and our orator.’ The apostle did so, <br/>
and ‘Utarid b.‘Hajib got up and said: </p>
<p>935 ‘Praise belongs to God for His favour to us and He is worthy to be <br/>
praised, who has made us kings and given us great wealth wherewith we are <br/>
generous, and has made us the strongest people of the east and the greatest <br/>
in number, and the best equipped, so who among mankind is our equal ? <br/>
Are we not the princes of men and their superiors ? He who would compete <br/>
with us let him enumerate what we have enumerated. If we wished we <br/>
could say more, but we are too modest to say much of what He has given <br/>
us and are well known for that. I say this that you may bring forward the <br/>
like and anything better.’ Then he sat down. The apostle said to Thabit </p>
<p>1 Sura no. For a criticism of this translation (demanded by I.I.’s exegesia) and of 1 . 1 . » <br/>
explanation see Suhayli in loc. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 629 </p>
<p>b. Qays b. al-Shammas, brother of B. al-Harith b. al-Khazraj, ‘Get up and <br/>
answer the man’s speech’; so Thabit got up and said: </p>
<p>‘Praise belongs to God Who created heaven and earth and established <br/>
His rule therein, and His knowledge includes His throne; nothing exists <br/>
but by His bounty. By His power He made us kings and chose the best of <br/>
His creation as an apostle, and honoured him with lineage, made him <br/>
truthful in speech, and favoured him with reputation, and sent down to <br/>
him His book and entrusted him with it above (all) that He had created. </p>
<p>He was God’s choice from the worlds. Then He summoned men to <br/>
believe in him, and the emigrants from his people and his kinsmen <br/>
believed in God’s apostle; the most noble men in reputation, the highest <br/>
in dignity, and the best in deeds. The first of creatures to answer and <br/>
respond to God when the apostle called them were ourselves. We are <br/>
God’s helpers and the assistants of His apostle, and will fight men until <br/>
they believe in God; and he who believes in God and His apostle has <br/>
protected his life and property from us; and he who disbelieves we will <br/>
fight in God unceasingly and killing him will be a small matter to us. <br/>
These are my words and I ask God’s pardon for myself and the believers <br/>
both men and women. Peace upon you.’ </p>
<p>(T. Then they said, ‘Give permission to our poet to speak’ and he did <br/>
so,) and al-Zibriqan got up and said: </p>
<p>We are the nobles, no tribe can equal us. </p>
<p>From us kings are born and in our midst churches are built. </p>
<p>How many tribes have we plundered, </p>
<p>For excellence in glory is to be sought after. </p>
<p>In time of dearth we feed our meat to the hungry <br/>
When no rain cloud can be seen. </p>
<p>You can see chiefs coming to us from every land, </p>
<p>And we feed them lavishly. </p>
<p>We slaughter fat-humped young camels as a matter of course; 936 </p>
<p>Guests when they come are satisfied with food. </p>
<p>You will see whenever we challenge a tribe’s superiority <br/>
They yield and abandon leadership. 1 <br/>
He who challenges us we know the result: </p>
<p>His people withdraw and the news is noised abroad. </p>
<p>We forbid others but none forbid us. </p>
<p>Thus we are justly exalted in pride (879). </p>
<p>Hassan was absent at the time and the apostle sent a messenger to tell <br/>
him to come and answer the B. Tamlm’s poet. Hassan said, As I went to <br/>
the apostle I was saying: </p>
<p>We protected God’s apostle when he dwelt among us <br/>
Whether Ma'add liked it or not. </p>
<p>1 Lit. 'become as a head that is cut off’. </p>
<p>630 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>We protected him when he dwelt among our houses <br/>
With our swords against every evil wretch <br/>
In a unique house whose glory and wealth <br/>
Is in Jabiyatu’l-Jaulan among the foreigners. </p>
<p>Is glory aught but ancient lordship and generosity, </p>
<p>The dignity of kings and the bearing of great burdens ? </p>
<p>When I came to the apostle and the tribal poet had said his say, I made <br/>
allusions to what he had said on the same pattern. When al-Zibriqan had <br/>
finished the apostle said to Hassan, ‘Get up and answer the man,’ and <br/>
Hassan arose and said: </p>
<p>The leaders of Fihr and their brothers <br/>
Have shown a way of life to be followed. </p>
<p>Everyone whose heart is devout </p>
<p>And does all manner of good approves them. </p>
<p>Such a people when they fight injure their enemies <br/>
Or gain the advantage of their adherents which they seek. </p>
<p>Such is their nature—no recent habit. </p>
<p>(The worst of characteristics is innovation.) </p>
<p>937 If there are men who surpass those who come after them <br/>
Then they would be behind the last of them. </p>
<p>Men do not repair what their hands have destroyed in fighting. </p>
<p>Nor destroy what they have repaired. </p>
<p>If they compete with others they take the lead. </p>
<p>If weighed against men famous for liberality they send down the scale. <br/>
Chaste men whose chastity is mentioned in revelation, </p>
<p>Undefiled, no impurity can injure them. </p>
<p>Not mean with their wealth towards the sojourner <br/>
And no stain of covetousness touches them. </p>
<p>When we attack a tribe we do not go softly to them <br/>
Like a calf running to the wild cow. </p>
<p>We rise up when the claws of war reach us <br/>
When good-for-naughts are humbled by its nails. </p>
<p>They do not boast when they overcome their enemy,* </p>
<p>And if they are beaten they are not weak nor despairing. </p>
<p>In battle when death is at hand </p>
<p>They are like lions in Halya with crooked claws. </p>
<p>Take what you can get if they are enraged <br/>
And seek not what they have forbidden. </p>
<p>To fight them is to meet poison and bane <br/>
So do not antagonize them. </p>
<p>How noble the people who have God’s apostle with them 1 <br/>
When sects and parties differ! </p>
<p>My heart sings their praises </p>
<p>1 Rasulu’llahi shi'atuhum. </p>
<p>631 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Aided in its beloved task by an eloquent and ready tongue, </p>
<p>For they are the best of all creatures <br/>
In matters grave and gay (S80). </p>
<p>When Hassan had ended al-Aqra' said: ‘By my father, this man has a 938 <br/>
ready helper. His orator and his poet are better than ours and their <br/>
voices are sweeter 1 than ours,’ In the end they accepted Islam and the <br/>
apostle gave them valuable gifts. </p>
<p>They had left 'Amr b. al-Ahtam behind with their camels, he being <br/>
the youngest of them. Qays b. 'Asim, who hated ‘Amr, said, ‘O apostle <br/>
of God, there is one of our men with the camels, a mere youngster,’ and <br/>
he spoke disparagingly of him. But the apostle gave him the same as he <br/>
gave the others. When 'Amr heard that Qays had said that, he satirized 030 <br/>
him thus: </p>
<p>You exposed yourself to contempt when you defamed me to the <br/>
apostle. </p>
<p>You were a liar and spoke not the truth. </p>
<p>(T. A ou may hate us, for Roman is your origin </p>
<p>But Rome does not hold hatred for the Arabs.) </p>
<p>We ruled you with a wide authority, but your authority </p>
<p>Is that of one sitting on his behind and showing his teeth! 2 (881) </p>
<p>Concerning them the Quran came down: ‘Those who call you from <br/>
behind the private apartments most of them have no sense.’ 3 </p>
<p>THE STORY OF 'AMIR B. AL-TUFAYL AND ARBAD B. QAYS </p>
<p>Among the deputation from B. 'Amir was 'Amir b. al-Tufayl and Arbad <br/>
b.^ Qays b. Jaz’ b. Khalid b. Ja'far, and Jabbar b. Salma b. Malik b. </p>
<p>Ja'far. These three were the chiefs and leaders of the tribe. </p>
<p>'Amir, the enemy of God, 4 came to the apostle intending to kill him <br/>
treacherously. His people had urged him to accept Islam because others <br/>
had done so, but he said: ‘I have sworn that I wall not stop until the Arabs <br/>
follow me. Am I to follow in the steps of this fellow from Quraysh ?’ Then <br/>
he said to Arbad: ‘When we get to the man I will distract his attention <br/>
from you, and when I do that smite him with your sword.’ When they <br/>
got to the apostle 'Amir said, ‘Muhammad, come apart with me.’ 5 He </p>
<p>1 So C. ( ahla ). W. has a Id 'rise above ours’. </p>
<p>2 i.e. a dog. In T 1717 the verse runs: </p>
<p>We ruled and our authority is ancient, but your authority <br/>
Is behind at the root of the rump and the tail. </p>
<p>If we may suppose that there is a play on the word 'aud which should be read as 'lid and <br/>
understood as a synonym of qadxb (cf. Ibn Jufayl, ffayy b. Yaqzan , 85), it is easy to see why <br/>
I.H. cut out one verse and bowdlerized the next. </p>
<p>T. has Those of the Banu Tamim who call you from behind the private apartments <br/>
have no sense” and that is the preferable reading.’ Sura 49. 4. Cf. Wellhausen, Muhammed <br/>
m Medina, 3 87. 4 T- omits the label. </p>
<p>A less likely meaning, as the commentators point out, is ‘make friends with me’. </p>
<p>632 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>replied, ‘No, I will not until you believe in God alone.’ He repeated the <br/>
request and went on talking to him expecting that Arbad would do as <br/>
he had told him but he remained inactive. He again repeated his request <br/>
and got the same answer. When the apostle refused he said, ‘By God I will </p>
<p>940 fill the land against you with horses and men.’ When they went away the <br/>
apostle said, ‘O God, rid me of 'Amir b. al-Tufayl.’ On their way back <br/>
'Amir said to Arbad, ‘Confound you, Arbad, why didn’t you do what I <br/>
ordered ? By God there is no man on the face of the earth whom I fear more <br/>
than you, but by God I shall never fear you after today.’ He answered, <br/>
‘Don’t be hasty with me. Whenever I tried to get at him as you ordered, <br/>
you got in the way so that I could see only you. Was I to smite you with the <br/>
sword?’ </p>
<p>T- 1747 (T. 'Amir b. al-Tufayl said: </p>
<p>The apostle sent word about what you know and it w r as as though <br/>
We were making a planned raid on the squadrons <br/>
And our worn-out horses had brought us to Medina <br/>
And we had killed the Ansar in its midst.) </p>
<p>As they were on their way back God sent a bubonic plague in 'Amir’s <br/>
neck, and God killed him in the house of a woman of B. Salul. He began <br/>
to say, ‘O Banu 'Amir, A boil like the boil of a young carriel in the house <br/>
of a woman of Banu Salul!’ (882) 1 </p>
<p>Wben they had buried him his companions returned to the B. 'Amir <br/>
country to winter and the people asked Arbad what had happened. <br/>
‘Nothing, by God,’ he said; ‘he asked us to worship something. I wish <br/>
he were here now and I would kill him with an arrow'.’ A day or two after <br/>
saying this he went out with his camel behind him and God sent on him <br/>
and his camel a thunderbolt which consumed them. Arbad was brother <br/>
of Labid b. Rabl'a by the same mother (883). </p>
<p>Labid said, weeping Arbad: </p>
<p>The fates spare none, </p>
<p>Neither anxious father nor son. </p>
<p>I feared a violent death for Arbad </p>
<p>But I did not fear the blow of Pisces and Leo. </p>
<p>941 O eye, why do you not weep for Arbad <br/>
Since we and the women rise in sorrow ? </p>
<p>If men blustered he took no notice, </p>
<p>If they were moderate in judgement he showed moderation. </p>
<p>Sweet, astute, w'ithal in his sweetness bitter, </p>
<p>Gentle in bowels and liver. </p>
<p>O eye, why do you not weep for Arbad </p>
<p>When the winter winds strip the leaves from the trees </p>
<p>And make pregnant camels milkless </p>
<p>1 These words are proverbial; see Freytag, Prov. ii. 172. </p>

<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Until the last few drops appear? (He was) </p>
<p>Bolder than a man-eating lion in his thicket. </p>
<p>Eager for fame and far-seeing. </p>
<p>The eye could not see as far as it wished <br/>
The night the horses came weak from the battle. </p>
<p>ho sent the mourning-women among his mourners <br/>
Like young gazelles in a barren land. </p>
<p>The lightning and thunderbolts distressed me <br/>
For the brave knight on the day of misfortune. </p>
<p>Who spoiled the spoiler to repay the spoiled <br/>
Who came to him distressed and if he asked for more he gave it; <br/>
Liberal when times were bad <br/>
As the gentle spring rain that waters the grass. </p>
<p>All sons of a freewoman must become few <br/>
However many she bare. </p>
<p>Envied though they be, they must fall; </p>
<p>Though they hold authority one day they must perish and die (884). <br/>
Labid also said: </p>
<p>Gone is the guard and protector </p>
<p>Who saved her from shame on the day of battle. </p>
<p>I was sure wc had parted (for ever) the day they said, </p>
<p>‘Arbad’s property is being divided by lot.’ </p>
<p>The shares of the heirs fly off in double and single lots <br/>
And authority 1 goes to the young man. </p>
<p>Bid farewell to Abu Hurayz with a blessing, </p>
<p>Though farewell to Arbad brings little of that. </p>
<p> ou were our leader and organizer, </p>
<p>For beads must be held together by a string; </p>
<p>And Arbad was a warlike knight 942 </p>
<p>When the howdahs w : ith their coverings w r ere overthrown; </p>
<p>W hen in the morning the women were carried pillion <br/>
With faces unveiled and legs bare; </p>
<p>On that day men fled to him for safety <br/>
As a man at large flees to the sanctuary. </p>
<p>He who came to Arbad’s cooking-pot praised it <br/>
And thos£,wvho had much meat were not reproached. </p>
<p>If a woman were his guest </p>
<p>She had gifts and a share of the best meat; </p>
<p>If she stayed she was honoured and respected; </p>
<p>If she went forth ’twas wdth a kind farew ell. </p>
<p>Have you ever heard of two brothers who endured for ever <br/>
Save the two^ons of Shamam? 2 </p>
<p>Another explanation of za ama is ‘the best of the inheritance'. </p>
<p>2 Two mountains. </p>
<p>634 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Or the two stars of the polar region and the Great Bear <br/>
Everlasting, their destruction unthinkable. 1 </p>
<p>Labid also said: </p>
<p>Announce to the noble the death of noble Arbad, </p>
<p>Announce the death of the chief, the kind-hearted, </p>
<p>Giving away his wealth that he might gam praise, </p>
<p>Camels like wild untamed cows, </p>
<p>Abundant in virtues if they were reckoned, </p>
<p>Who filled the platter again and again. </p>
<p>Whenever a poor man came he ate at will <br/>
As when a lion finds water in a dry land. </p>
<p>The more he is threatened the nearer he comes. </p>
<p>You have left us no paltry inheritance, </p>
<p>And wealth newly acquired and sons, </p>
<p>Youths like hawks, young men, and beardless boys. </p>
<p>Labid also said: </p>
<p>You will never exhaust the good deeds of Arbad, so weep for him <br/>
continually. </p>
<p>Say, He was the protecting warrior when armour was donned. </p>
<p>He kept wrong-doers from us when we met insolent enemies. </p>
<p>The Lord of creation took him away since He saw there was no long <br/>
stay on earth. </p>
<p>943 He died painlessly without hurt and he is sorely missed. </p>
<p>Labid also said: </p>
<p>Every bitter opponent whose way seemed harmful reminds me of </p>
<p>Arbad. . , </p>
<p>If they were fair, then he was nobly fair: if they were unfair so was he. <br/>
He guided the people carefully when their guide went astray in the <br/>
desert (885). </p>
<p>Labid also said: </p>
<p>I went walking after (the death of) Salma b. Malik <br/>
And Abu Qays and 'Urwa like a camel whose hump is cut off. 2 <br/>
When it sees the shadow of a raven it shoos it away <br/>
Anxious for the rest of its spine and sinews (886). </p>
<p>THE COMING OF DIMAM B. THA LA BA AS A DEPUTY <br/>
FROM BANU Sa'd B. BAKR </p>
<p>The B Sa'd b. Bakr sent one of their men called Dimam b. Tha'laba to the <br/>
apostle. Muhammad b. al-Walld b. Nuwayfi’ from Kurayb client of </p>
<p>1 In Brockelmann’s edn. the poem (xviii) has 31 verses. The text in Chalidi, p. 17 . lb m <br/>
better sequence. 2 B &gt;' its starving owners m them hunger. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 635 </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. 'Abbas from Ibn 'Abbas told me: When the B. Sa'd sent <br/>
Dimam to the apostle he came and made his camel kneel at the door of the <br/>
mosque, hobbled it, and went into the mosque where the apostle was sitting <br/>
with his companions. Now Dimam was a thickset hairy man with two fore¬ <br/>
locks. He came forward until he stood over the apostle and said, ‘Which of <br/>
you is the son of 'AbduTMuttalib ?’ The apostle said that he was. ‘Are you <br/>
Muhammad ?’he asked. When he said thathewashe said ,‘0 son of‘Abdu’l- <br/>
Muttalib, I am going to ask you a hard question, so don’t take it amiss.’ The <br/>
apostle told him to ask what he liked and he would not take it amiss and he <br/>
said, ‘I adjure you by God your God and the God of those before you and <br/>
the God of those who will come after you, has God sent you to us as an <br/>
apostle ?’ ‘Yes, by God He has,’ he replied. He then adjured him to answer <br/>
the questions. ‘Has He ordered you to order us to serve Him alone and not <br/>
to associate anything with Him and to discard those rival deities which our 944 <br/>
fathers used to worship along with Him; and to pray these five prayers; <br/>
then the ordinances of Islam one by one, alms, fasting, pilgrimage, and all <br/>
the laws of Islam?’ At the end he said: ‘I testify that there is no God but <br/>
Allah and I testify that Muhammad is the apostle of God, and I will carry <br/>
out these ordinances, and I will avoid what you have forbidden me to do; </p>
<p>I will neither add to, nor diminish from them.’ Then he went back to his <br/>
camel. The apostle said, ‘If this man with the two forelocks is sincere he <br/>
will go to Paradise.’ </p>
<p>The man went to his camel, freed it from its hobble, and went off to his <br/>
people, and when they gathered to him the first thing he said was, ‘How <br/>
evil are al-Lat and al-'Uzza!’ 1 ‘Heavens above, Dimam,’ they said, ‘beware <br/>
of leprosy and elephantiasis and madness!’ He said: ‘Woe to you, they can <br/>
neither hurt nor heal. God has sent an apostle and sent down to him a <br/>
book, so seek deliverance thereby from your present state; as for me, I <br/>
bear witness that there is no God but the one God who is without associate, <br/>
and that Muhammad is His slave and apostle. I have brought you what <br/>
He has commanded you to do and what He has ordered you not to do.’ </p>
<p>And by God before the night was over there was not a man or woman in the <br/>
tribe who had not become a Muslim. ‘Abdullah b. 'Abbas said: We have <br/>
never heard of a representative of a tribe finer than Dimam b. Tha'laba. </p>
<p>THE COMING OF AL-JARUD IN THE DEPUTATION FROM </p>
<p>'abdu’l-qays </p>
<p>Al-Jarud b. 'Amr b. Hanash, brother of ‘Abdu’l-Qays, came to the apostle <br/>
(887). </p>
<p>One of whom I have no suspicion told me from al-Hasan that when he 945 <br/>
came to the apostle he spoke to him, and the apostle explained Islam to him <br/>
and invited him to enter it with kindly words. He replied: ‘Muhammad, </p>
<p>1 The expression may have a coarser meaning. </p>
<p>636 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>I owe a debt. If I leave my religion for yours will you guarantee my <br/>
debt?’ The apostle said, ‘Yes, I guarantee that what God has guided you <br/>
to is better than that’, so he and his companions accepted Islam. Then he <br/>
asked the apostle for some mounts, but he told him that he had none <br/>
available. Al-Jarud pointed out that there were some stray beasts lying <br/>
between Medina and his country and could he not ride away on them? <br/>
He replied, ‘No, beware of them, for that would lead to hell fire.’ </p>
<p>Al-Jarud went off to his own tribe, a good Muslim, firm in his religion <br/>
until his death, having lived to the time of the Apostasy. And when some <br/>
of his people who had become Muslims returned to their former religion <br/>
with al-Gharur 1 b. al-Mundhir b. al-Nu'man b. al-Mundhir, al-Jarud got <br/>
up and spoke and confessed his faith and called them to Islam. He pro¬ <br/>
nounced the shahada and declared that he would regard anyone who <br/>
refused to do likewise as an infidel (888). </p>
<p>The apostle had sent al-'Ala’ b. al-Hadraml to al-Mundhir b. Sawa <br/>
al-'Abdi before the conquest of Mecca, and he became a good Muslim. <br/>
He died after the apostle but before the apostasy of the people of al-Bah- <br/>
rayn. Al-'Ala’ was with him as governor for the apostle over al-Bahrayn. </p>
<p>THE DEPUTATION FROM BANU HANIFA WITH WHOM <br/>
WAS MUSAY LIMA </p>
<p>The deputation of B. Hanifa came to the apostle bringing with them <br/>
Musaylima b, Habib al-Hanafi, the arch liar (889). They lodged in the <br/>
house of d. al-Harith, a woman of the Ansar of B. al-Najjar. One of the <br/>
scholars of Medina told me that B. Hanifa brought him to the apostle <br/>
946 hiding him in garments. The apostle was sitting among his companions <br/>
having a palm-branch with some leaves on its upper end. When he came <br/>
to the apostle as they were covering him with garments he spoke to him <br/>
and asked him (for a gift). The apostle answered: ‘If you were to ask me <br/>
for this palm branch (T. which I hold) I would not give it to you.’ </p>
<p>A shaykh of B. Hanifa from the people of al-Yamama told me that the <br/>
incident happened otherwise. He alleged that the deputation came to the <br/>
apostle having left Musaylima behind with the camels and the baggage. <br/>
When they had accepted Islam they remembered where he was, and told <br/>
the apostle that they had left a companion of theirs to guard their stuff. <br/>
The apostle ordered that he should be given the same as the rest, saying, <br/>
‘His position is no worse than yours,’ i.e. in minding the property of his <br/>
companions. That is what the apostle meant. </p>
<p>Then they left the apostle and brought him what he had given him. <br/>
When they reached al-Yamama the enemy of God apostatized, gave <br/>
himself out as a prophet, and played the liar. He said, ‘I am a partner with <br/>
him in the affair,’ and then he said to the deputation who had been with </p>
<p>1 According to S. his name was al-Mundhir and he got the name of ‘The Deceiver’ <br/>
because he misled ( gharra ) his people in the apostate rising, </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 63-7 </p>
<p>him, ‘Did he not say to you when you mentioned me to him “His position <br/>
is no worse than yours” ? What can that mean but mat he knows that I am <br/>
a partner with him in the affair?’ Then he began to utter rhymes in sat' <br/>
and speak in imitation of the style of the Quran: ‘God has been gracious <br/>
to the pregnant woman; He has brought forth from her a living being that <br/>
can move; from her very midst.’ He permitted them to drink wine and <br/>
fornicate, and let them dispense with prayer, yet he was acknowledging <br/>
the apostle as a prophet, and Hanifa agreed with him on that. But God <br/>
knows what the truth was. </p>
<p>zaydu’l-khayl comes with the deputation from </p>
<p>Tayyi* </p>
<p>The deputation of Tayyi’ containing Zaydu’l-Khayl who was their chief <br/>
came to the apostle, and after some conversation he explained Islam to <br/>
them and they became good Muslims. A man of Tayyi’ whom I have no <br/>
reason to suspect told me that the apostle said, ‘No Arab has ever been 947 <br/>
spoken of in the highest terms but when I have met him I have found that <br/>
he falls below what was said of him except Zaydu’I-Khayl, and he exceeds <br/>
all that has been said about him.’ Then the apostle named him Zaydu’l- <br/>
Khayr and allotted to him Fayd and some lands with it and gave him a <br/>
deed accordingly. </p>
<p>As Zayd went back to his tribe the apostle said that he hoped he would <br/>
escape the Medina fever. The apostle did not call it Humma or Umm <br/>
Maldam; my informant could not say what. When he reached one <br/>
of the watering-places of Najd called Farda the fever overcame him and <br/>
he died. When he felt his end coming he said: </p>
<p>Are my people to travel eastwards tomorrow <br/>
While I’m to be left in a house in Farda in Najd? </p>
<p>How often if I were sick would women visit me <br/>
If not worn out by the journey at least tired. </p>
<p>When he was dead his wife got the deeds which the apostle had given <br/>
him and burnt them in the fire. </p>
<p>'adIy B. hatim </p>
<p>I have been told that ‘AdIy b. Hatim used to say, ‘No Arab disliked the <br/>
apostle when he first heard of him more than I. Now I was a chief of <br/>
noble birth, a Christian, and I used to travel about among my people to <br/>
collect a quarter of their stock. I was my own master in religious matters <br/>
and was a king among my people and treated as such. When I heard of the <br/>
apostle I disliked him and said to an Arab servant of mine who was looking <br/>
after my camels, “Prepare some of my well-trained, well-fed camels, and <br/>
keep them near me, and when you hear of Muhammad’s army coming </p>
<p>638 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>into this country bring me word.” One morning he came to me and said, <br/>
“Whatever you are going to do when Muhammad’s cavalry comes upon </p>
<p>948 you, do it now, for I have seen flags and I learn that they are the troops of <br/>
Muhammad.” I ordered him to bring my camels and I put my family <br/>
and children on them and decided to join my fellow Christians in Syria. <br/>
I went as far as al-Jaushiya (890) and I left one of Hatim’s daughters in the <br/>
settlement. When I reached Syria I stopped there. </p>
<p>In my absence the apostle’s cavalry came and among the captives they <br/>
took was Hatim’s daughter, and she was brought to the apostle among the <br/>
captives of Tayyi’. The apostle had heard of my flight to Syria. Hatim’s <br/>
daughter was put in the enclosure by the door of the mosque in which the <br/>
captives were imprisoned and the apostle passed by her. She got up to meet <br/>
him, for she was a courteous woman, and said, ‘O apostle of God, my father <br/>
is dead and the man who should act for me 1 has gone. If you spare me <br/>
God will spare you.’ He asked her who her man was and when she told <br/>
him it was 'Adiy b. Hatim he exclaimed, ‘The man who runs away from <br/>
God and His apostle.’ Then he w 7 ent on and left her. Exactly the same <br/>
thing happened the next day, and on the following day she w r as in despair. <br/>
Then a man behind him motioned to her to get up and speak to him. She <br/>
said the same words as before and he replied, “I have done so, but do not <br/>
hurry away until you find one of your people whom you can trust who can <br/>
take you to your country, then let me know'.” I asked the name of the man <br/>
who had beckoned to me to speak and was told that it was 'All. I stayed <br/>
until some riders came from Ball or Quda'a. All I wanted was to go to <br/>
my brother in Syria. I went to the apostle and told him that some trust¬ <br/>
worthy man of reputation from my people had come for me. The apostle <br/>
gave me clothing and put me on a camel and gave me money and I w r ent <br/>
away with them until I came to Syria. </p>
<p>'AdTy said: ‘ I w r as sitting among my people when I saw a howdah making <br/>
for us and I said “It is Hatim’s daughter” and so it was, and when she got </p>
<p>949 to me she reviled me, saying, ‘You evil rascal, you carried away your family <br/>
and children and abandoned your father’s daughter.’ I said, “Do not say <br/>
anything that is bad, little sister, for by God I have no excuse. I did do <br/>
what you say.” Then she alighted and stayed with me; and as she was a <br/>
discreet woman I asked her what she thought of this man and she said, <br/>
“I think that you should join him quickly, for if the man is a prophet then <br/>
those w'ho get to him first will be preferred; and if he is a king you will <br/>
not be shamed in the glory of al-Yaman, you being the man you are.” </p>
<p>I said that this was a sound judgement so I went to the apostle when he <br/>
was in his mosque in Medina and saluted him and told him my name and <br/>
he got up to take me to his house. As we were making for it there met him <br/>
an old feeble woman w r ho asked him to stop and he stopped for a long time </p>
<p>1 I doubt if viafid means ‘visitor’ as A.Dh., followed by C., asserts, or ‘clan’ as Qdmus, s.v., </p>
<p>. Uyun, ii, 239, quoted in T. 1708, reports that some scholars find the word meaningless and <br/>
its explanation far-fetched. See Tab. Gloss. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 6^^ </p>
<p>while she told him of her needs. I said to myself “This is no king.” Then <br/>
he took me into his house and took hold of a leather cushion stuffed with <br/>
palm leaves and threw it to me saying, “Sit on that.” I said, “No, you sit on <br/>
it,” and he said “No, you!” So I sat on it and he sat on the ground. I said to <br/>
myself, “This is not the way a king behaves.” Then he said, “Now 'Adiy, are <br/>
you not half a Christian ?”' When I said that I was he said, “Don’t you go <br/>
among your people collecting a quarter of their stock?” When I admitted <br/>
that he said: But that is not permitted to you in your religion.” “Quite <br/>
true,” I said, and I knew that he was a prophet sent by God knowing what <br/>
is not generally known. Then he said, “It may well be that the poverty <br/>
you see prevents you from joining this religion but, by God, wealth will <br/>
soon flow so copiously among them that there will not be the people to <br/>
take it. But perhaps it is that you see how many are their enemies and how <br/>
few they are? But, by God, you will hear of a woman coming on her camel <br/>
from Qadisiya to visit this temple 2 unafraid. But perhaps it is that you see <br/>
that others have the power and sovereignty, but by God you will soon 950 <br/>
hear that the white castles of Babylon have been opened to them.” Then <br/>
I became a Muslim.’ </p>
<p>'Adiy used to say that the two things happened and the third remained <br/>
to be fulfilled. I saw the white castles of Babylon laid open and I saw <br/>
women coming from Qadisiya on camels unafraid to make the pilgrimage <br/>
to this temple; and, by God, the third will come to pass: wealth will flow <br/>
until there will not be the people to take it. </p>
<p>THE COMING OF FARWA B. MUSAYK AL-MURADI </p>
<p>Farwa b. Musayk al-Muradl came to the apostle, separating himself from <br/>
the kings of ICinda. Shortly before Islam there had been a battle between <br/>
Murad and Hamdan in which the former suffered a severe defeat, losing <br/>
many men in the engagement called al-Radm (T. al-Razm). The leader of <br/>
Hamdan was al-Ajda' b. Malik (891). </p>
<p>Farwa said about the battle: </p>
<p>They passed by Lufat 3 with sunken eyes </p>
<p>Tugging at the reins as they turned to one side. </p>
<p>If we conquer we were conquerors of old </p>
<p>And if W'e are conquered we were not often conquered. </p>
<p>Cowardice is not our habit, </p>
<p>But our fate and the fortune of others (caused our defeat). </p>
<p>Thus fate’s wheel turns </p>
<p>1 Rafalsi is defined as a man midway between a Christian and a $abi’ which latter, as we <br/>
have seen, means a man who changes his religion. Thus 'Adiy would seem to he, like so <br/>
many of the Arabs at this time, a convert but not a practising Christian in the full sense. </p>
<p>The words imply the Ka ba at Mecca and the next paragraph makes this certain. As <br/>
the conversation is said to have taken place in Medina the authenticity of the tradition is <br/>
suspect, unless hadha means no more than ‘yon’. </p>
<p>3 In Murad territory. </p>
<p>640 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Now for and now against a man. </p>
<p>While we are happy and rejoice in it, </p>
<p>Though we have enjoyed its favour for years, </p>
<p>Suddenly fate’s wheel is turned </p>
<p>And you find those who were envied ground to pieces. </p>
<p>Those whom men envy for fate’s favours <br/>
Will find time’s changes deceitful. </p>
<p>If kings were immortal we should be so; </p>
<p>And if the noble persisted so should we; </p>
<p>951 But the chiefs of my people are swept away <br/>
Like the generations before them (892). </p>
<p>When Farwa set out to go to the apostle, leaving the kings of Kinda, he <br/>
said: </p>
<p>When I saw the kings of Kinda had failed to go right, </p>
<p>Like a man whose leg sinew lets him down, </p>
<p>I brought up my camel to go to Muhammad <br/>
Hoping for its welfare and good ground (893). </p>
<p>When he reached the apostle he asked him, so I have been told, ‘Are <br/>
you upset at what befell your people on the day of al-Radm? He <br/>
answered that such a tribal defeat as that would distress any man, and t e <br/>
apostle said that if that were so Islam could bring them only good. The <br/>
prophet appointed him governor over Murad and Zubayd and Madh.ij <br/>
and sent with him Khalid b. Sa'ld b. al-'As in charge of the poor tax; <br/>
he remained with him in his land until the death of the apostle. </p>
<p>THE COMING OF MA'DIKARIB FROM THE BANU ZUBAYD </p>
<p>’Amr b. Ma'dlkarib came to the apostle with some men of B. Zubayd and <br/>
accepted Islam. He had said to Qays b. Makshuh al-Muradl when news <br/>
of the apostle reached them, ‘You are the chief of your tribe, Qays. We <br/>
have heard that a man of Quraysh called Muhammad has appeared in the <br/>
Hijaz claiming to be a prophet, so come with us so that we may find out the <br/>
facts. If he is a prophet as he says, it will be apparent to you and when we <br/>
meet him we will follow him. If he is not a prophet we shall know.’ But <br/>
Qays refused and declared his advice to be folly. Thereupon 'Amr rode <br/>
952 off to the apostle and accepted Islam. When Qays heard of this he was <br/>
enraged and threatened 'Amr, saying that he had gone against him and <br/>
rejected his advice. 'Amr said concerning that: </p>
<p>I gave you an order on the day of Dhu San a , </p>
<p>An order that was plainly right. </p>
<p>I ordered you to fear God and to practise goodness. </p>
<p>You went off after pleasure like a young ass <br/>
Whose lust beguiled him. </p>
<p>641 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>He wished to meet me on a horse on which I sat as a lion <br/>
Wearing a loose coat of mail glittering like a pool <br/>
On hard ground which makes the water clear. </p>
<p>Mail that turns back the lances with bent points <br/>
With broken shafts flying apart. </p>
<p>Had you met me you would have met a lion with flowing mane. </p>
<p>You would meet a ravening beast <br/>
With mighty paws and lofty shoulders <br/>
Matching his adversary whom he overthrows if he makes for him: <br/>
Seizes him, picks him up, throws him down and kills him; </p>
<p>Dashes out his brains and shatters him; </p>
<p>Tears him in pieces and devours him, </p>
<p>Admitting none a share in the prey his teeth and claws hold fast (894), </p>
<p>Amr stayed with his people the B. Zubayd while Farwa b. Musayk <br/>
was over them. When the apostle died 'Amr revolted, and said: </p>
<p>We have found Farwa’s rule the worst of rules, </p>
<p>An ass sniffing at a female ass. </p>
<p>If you were to look at Abu 'Umayr </p>
<p>You would think he was a caul with its filthy discharge (895). </p>
<p>al-ash'ath b. qays comes with the deputation </p>
<p>OF KINDA </p>
<p>Al-Ash'ath b. Qays came to the apostle with the deputation of Kinda. <br/>
Ai-Zuhrl told me that he came with eighty riders from Kinda and they <br/>
went in to the apostle in the mosque. They had combed their locks and <br/>
blackened their eyes with kohl, and they wore striped robes bordered with <br/>
silk. The apostle asked them if they had accepted Islam and when they <br/>
said that they had he asked why this silk was round their necks. So they <br/>
tore it off and threw it away. </p>
<p>Then al-Ash'ath said, ‘We are the sons of the eater of bitter herbs and <br/>
so are you.’ The apostle smiled and said that to al-'Abbas b. 'Abdu’l- <br/>
Muftalib and Rabl'a b. al-Harith that ancestry was attributed. These two <br/>
men were merchants and when they went about among the Arabs and were <br/>
asked who they were they would say that they were sons of the eater of <br/>
bitter herbs, taking pride in that because Kinda were kings. Then he <br/>
said to them, ‘Nay, we are the sons of al-Nadr b. Kinana: we do not follow <br/>
our mother’s line and disown our father.’ 1 Al-Ash'ath said ‘Have you <br/>
finished (T. Do you know), O men of Kinda? By God if I hear a man <br/>
saying that (T. after today) I will give him eighty strokes’ (896). </p>
<p>1 This throws light on Robertson Smith's theory of a primitive matriarchy in ancient' <br/>
Arabia. </p>

<p>6 4 2 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>THE COMING OF SURAD B. 'ABDULLAH AL-AZDI </p>
<p>Surad came to the apostle and became a good Muslim with the deputation <br/>
from al-Azd. The apostle put him in command of those of his people <br/>
who had accepted Islam and ordered him to fight the neighbouring <br/>
polytheists from the tribes of the Yaman with them. Sura we ^ awa Y <br/>
to carry out the apostle’s orders and stopped at Jurash, which at that ime <br/>
was a closed town containing some of the tribes of the Yaman. Khath am <br/>
had taken refuge with them and entered it when they heard of the approac <br/>
of the Muslims. The latter besieged them for about a month, but they <br/>
could not force an entry. Surad withdrew as far as one of their mountains <br/>
(now) called Shakar, and the inhabitants of Jurash, thinking that he had <br/>
fied from them, went out in pursuit of him, and when they overtoo im <br/>
he turned on them and killed a large number of them. . </p>
<p>Now the people of Jurash had sent two of their men to t e apost ^ in <br/>
Medina to look about them and see (what was happening), and while they <br/>
were with the apostle after the afternoon prayer he asked where Shakar <br/>
was. The two men got up and told him that there was a mountain in their <br/>
country called Kashar by the people of Jurash, to which he replied that it <br/>
was not Kashar but Shakar. ‘Then what is the news of it?'they asked. <br/>
‘Victims offered to God are being killed there now,’ he said. The two <br/>
men went and sat with Abu Bakr or it may have been TJthman and he <br/>
said, ‘Woe to you! the apostle has just announced to you the death <br/>
your people, so get up and ask him to pray to God to spare your people. <br/>
They did so, and he did so pray. They left the apostle and returned to <br/>
their people and found that they had been smitten on the day that Surad <br/>
attacked them on the very day and at the very hour in which the apostle </p>
<p>said these words. , </p>
<p>The deputation of Jurash came to the apostle and accepted Islam and </p>
<p>he gave them a special reserve 1 round their town with definite marks tor <br/>
horses, riding camels, and ploughing oxen. The cattle of any ( ot k er ) <br/>
man who pastured it could be seized with impunity. One of the Azd in <br/>
reference to that raid said: (Khath'am used to assail Azd in pagan times and <br/>
attack them in the sacred month): </p>
<p>What a successful raid we had! Mules, and horses and asses. </p>
<p>Until we came to Himyar with its forts </p>
<p>Where Khath'am had been given full warning. </p>
<p>If I could satisfy the rancour I feel </p>
<p>I should not care whether they were Muslims or heathen. </p>
<p>THE DEPUTATION OF THE KINGS OF HIMYAR </p>
<p>On his return from Tabuk a messenger brought a letter from the kings <br/>
of Himyar with their acceptance of Islam: al-Harith b. 'Abdu Kulal, and <br/>
1 The old word hirnd, meaning a sacred area, has lost its force here. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 643 </p>
<p>Nu'aym b. 'Abdu Kulal, and al-Nu'man prince of Dhii Ru'ayn and <br/>
Ma'afir and Hamdan. Zur'a Dhu Yazan sent Malik b. Murra al-RahawI <br/>
with their submission to Islam and abandonment of polytheism and its <br/>
adherents. Then the apostle wrote to them: ‘In the name of God the <br/>
Compassionate, the Merciful, from Muhammad the apostle of God, the 956 <br/>
prophet, to al-Harith b. 'Abdu Kulal and to Nu'aym b. 'Abdu Kulal 1 and <br/>
to al-Nu'man prince of Dhu Ru'ayn and Ma'afir and Hamdan. I praise <br/>
God the only God unto you. Your messenger reached me on my <br/>
return from the land of the Byzantines and he met us in Medina and con¬ <br/>
veyed your message and your news and informed us of your Islam and of <br/>
your killing the polytheists. God has guided you with His guidance. </p>
<p>If you do well and obey God and His apostle and perform prayer, and pay <br/>
alms, and God’s fifth of booty and the apostle’s share and selected part, 2 <br/>
and the poor tax which is incumbent on believers from land, namely a <br/>
tithe of that watered by fountains and rain; of that watered by the bucket <br/>
a twentieth; for ever)' forty camels a milch camel; for every thirty camels <br/>
a young male camel; for every five camels a sheep; for ever)' ten camels two <br/>
sheep; for every forty cows one cow; for every thirty cow's a bull calf or a <br/>
cow calf; for every forty sheep at pasture one sheep. This is what God has <br/>
laid upon the believers. Anyone who does more it is to his merit. He who <br/>
fulfils this and bears witness to his Islam and helps the believers against <br/>
the polytheists he is a believer with a believer’s rights and obligations and <br/>
he has the guarantee of God and His apostle. If a Jew or a Christian <br/>
becomes a Muslim he is a believer with his rights and obligations. He who <br/>
holds fast to his religion, Jew' or Christian, is not to be turned (T. seduced) <br/>
from it. He must pay the poll tax—for every adult, male or female, free <br/>
or slave, one full dinar calculated on the valuation of Ma'afir (T. or its <br/>
value) or its equivalent in clothes. He w r ho pays that to God’s apostle has <br/>
the guarantee of God and His apostle, and he w r ho withholds it is the enemy <br/>
of God and His apostle. </p>
<p>‘The apostle of God, Muhammad the prophet, has sent to Zur'a Dhu <br/>
Yazan: When my messenger Mu'adh b. Jabal, and 'Abdullah b. Zayd, <br/>
and Malik b. 'Ubada, and 'Uqba b. Nimr, and Malik b. Murra and their <br/>
companions come to you I commend them to your good offices. Collect the 957 <br/>
alms and the poll tax from your provinces and hand them over to my <br/>
messengers-. Their leader is Mu'adh b. Jabal, and let him not return unless <br/>
satisfied. Muhammad witnesses that there is no God but Allah and that <br/>
he is His servant and apostle. </p>
<p>‘Malik b. Murra al-RahawI has told me that you were the first of <br/>
Himyar to accept Islam and have killed the polytheists, and I congratulate <br/>
you and order you to treat Himyar w r ell and not to be false and treacherous, <br/>
for the apostle of God is the friend both of your poor and your rich. The </p>
<p>1 Bal. 71 adds ‘and to Sharh b. 'Abdu Kulal* and omits all words after' Hamdan’ as far as <br/>
‘polytheists’. </p>
<p>3 i.e. the part he chooses as his before the property is divided. </p>
<p>644 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>alms tax is not lawful to Muhammad or his household; it is alms to be <br/>
given to the poor Muslims and the wayfarer. Malik has brought the news <br/>
and kept secret what is confidential, and I order you to treat him well. <br/>
I have sent to you some of the best of my people, religious and learned men, <br/>
and I order you to treat them well, for they must be respected. 1 Peace <br/>
upon you and the mercy and blessings of God.’ </p>
<p>THE APOSTLE’S INSTRUCTIONS TO MU'ADH WHEN HE <br/>
SENT HIM TO THE YAMAN </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr told me that he was told that when the apostle sent <br/>
Mu'adh he gave him instructions and orders and then said: Deal gently <br/>
and not harshly; announce good news and do not repel people. You are <br/>
going to one of the people with scripture who will ask you about the key <br/>
of heaven. Say to them it is the witness that there is no God but Allah, <br/>
Who has no partner. Mu'adh went off to the Yaman and did as he was <br/>
ordered and a woman came to him and said, ‘O companion of God’s <br/>
apostle, what rights has a husband over his wife ?’ He said, ‘Woe to you, a <br/>
woman can never fulfil her husband’s rights, so do your utmost to fulfil <br/>
his claims as best you can.’ She said, ‘By God, if you are the companion <br/>
of God’s apostle you must know what rights a husband has over his wife!’ <br/>
He said, ‘If you were to go back and find him with his nostrils running <br/>
with pus and blood and sucked until you got rid of them you would not <br/>
have fulfilled your obligation.’ 2 </p>
<p>958 FARWA B. 'AMR AL-JUDHAmT BECOMES A MUSLIM </p>
<p>Fanva b. 'Amr b. al-Nafira al-Judhami of the clan of Nufatha sent to the <br/>
apostle that he had accepted Islam, and gave him a white mule. Farwa <br/>
was governor for the Byzantines of the Arabs lying near the Byzantine <br/>
border based on Ma'an and the surrounding land of Syria. When the <br/>
news reached the Byzantines they went after him, taught him, and im¬ <br/>
prisoned him. In his imprisonment he said: </p>
<p>Sulayma came to my companions by night </p>
<p>When the Romans were between the door and the water troughs. </p>
<p>The spectre shrank away sad at what it saw, </p>
<p>And I thought to sleep but it had made me weep. </p>
<p>Paint not thine eye with kohl , Salma, after I am dead </p>
<p>And do not approach for intercourse. </p>
<p>You know, Abu Kubaysha, that among the great ones </p>
<p>My tongue is not silent. </p>
<p>1 A difficult expression. Perhaps 'they are people of importance’, or even ‘they will be <br/>
watched’, i.e. to see how they fare. </p>
<p>1 Suhayll offers no comment. </p>
<p>645 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>If I perish you will miss your brother <br/>
And if I live you will recognize my rank, </p>
<p>For I possess the noblest qualities a man can have: </p>
<p>Generosity, bravery, and eloquence. </p>
<p>^ e .A f th  By2antine8 determined to crucify him by a pool in Palestine <br/>
called Afra he said: </p>
<p>Has Salma heard that her husband </p>
<p>Is by the water of 'Afra raised on a riding camel, 1 </p>
<p>A camel whose mother no stallion e’er mounted,* </p>
<p>Its branches shorn with sickles ? </p>
<p>Al-Zuhri alleged that when they brought him to crucify him he said: </p>
<p>Tell the chiefs of the Muslims that I <br/>
Surrender to my Lord my body and my bones. </p>
<p>Then they beheaded him and hung him up by that water. May God have <br/>
mercy on him! </p>
<p>THE BANU*L-HARITH ACCEPT ISLAM <br/>
Then the apostle sent Khalid b. al-Walid in the month of Rabi'u’l-Akhir </p>
<p>0r j u r u * l ' Cia lnthe y ear 10 to the B. al-H 5 rith b. Ka'b in NairSn and «,« <br/>
ordered him to invite them to Islam three days before he attacked them <br/>
It they accepted then he was to accept it from them ; 2 and if they declined <br/>
he was to fight them. So Khalid set out and came to them, and sen, out <br/>
riders ,n all directions inviting the people to Islam, saving, ‘If you accept </p>
<p>KMmTa W H  Sa i e ' 50 th ! men acCe P* ed Islam as the y were invited. <br/>
Khahd stayed with them teaching them Islam and the book of God and </p>
<p>he sunna of His prophet, for that was what the apostle of God had ordered <br/>
him to do if they accepted Islam and did not fighf 1 <br/>
Then Khalid wrote to the apostle: In the name of God the compassion- <br/>
Km'r'nv 1 , To Muhammad the prophet the apostle of God ? From <br/>

<p>646 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>And if they did not surrender I was to fight them. I duly came to them and <br/>
invited them to Islam three days as the apostle ordered me, and I sent <br/>
riders among them with your message. They have surrendered and have <br/>
not fought and I am staying among them instructing them in the apostle s <br/>
positive and negative commands and teaching them the institutions of <br/>
Islam and the prophet’s sunna until the apostle writes to me. Peace upon <br/>
you &amp;c. </p>
<p>The apostle wrote to him with the same preamble as before, saying; <br/>
‘I have received your letter which came with your messenger telling me <br/>
that the B. al-Harith surrendered before you fought them and responded <br/>
to your invitation to Islam and pronounced the shahada, and that God had <br/>
guided them with His guidance. So promise them good and warn them </p>
<p>960 and come. And let their deputation come with you. Peace upon you &amp;c. </p>
<p>So Khalid came to the apostle with the deputation of B. al-Harith, <br/>
among whom were Qays b. al-Husayn Dhu 1 -Ghussa, and Yazid b. <br/>
'Abdu’l-Madan, and Yazid b. al-Muhajjal, and 'Abdullah b. Qurad al- <br/>
Ziyadi, and Shaddad b. 'Abdullah al-Qanani, and 'Amr b. 'Abdullah </p>
<p>al-Pibabl. , , . , </p>
<p>When they came to the apostle he asked who these people who looked </p>
<p>like Indians were, and was told that they were the B. al-Harith b. Ka'b. <br/>
When they came to the apostle they said, ‘We testify that you are the <br/>
apostle of God and that there is no God but Allah.’ But he said, And I <br/>
testify that there is no God but Allah and that I am the apostle of Allah.’ 1 <br/>
Then he said, ‘You are the people who when they were driven away <br/>
pushed forward,’ and they remained silent, and none of them answered <br/>
him. He repeated the w r ords th'ree times without getting an answer, and <br/>
the fourth time Yazid b. Abdu’l-Madan said, ‘Yes, we are,’ and said it <br/>
four times. The apostle said, ‘If Khalid had not written to me that you <br/>
had accepted Islam and had not fought I would throw your heads beneath <br/>
your feet.’ Yazid answered, ‘We do not praise you and we do not praise <br/>
Khalid.’ ‘Then whom do you praise?’ he asked. He said: ‘We praise <br/>
God who guided us by you.’ ‘You are right,’ he said, and asked them how <br/>
they used to conquer those they fought in the pagan period. They said <br/>
that they never conquered anyone. ‘Nay, but you did conquer those who <br/>
fought you,’ he said. They replied, ‘We used to conquer those we fought <br/>
because we were united and had no dissentients, and never began an <br/>
injustice.’ He said, ‘You are right,’ and he appointed Qays b. al-Husayn </p>
<p>as their leader. . ou </p>
<p>The deputation returned to their people towards the end of bhawwal <br/>
or at the beginning of Dhu’l-Qa'da, and some four months after their </p>
<p>return the apostle died. . , </p>
<p>961 Now the apostle had sent to them after their deputation had returned <br/>
'Amr b. Hazm to instruct them in religion and to teach them the sunna <br/>
and the institutions of Islam and to collect their alms; and he wrote him a </p>
<p>1 They had placed man before God. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 647 </p>
<p>letter in which he gave him his orders and injunctions as follows: In the <br/>
name of God the Compassionate, the Merciful. This is a clear announce¬ <br/>
ment from God and His apostle. O you who believe, be faithful to your <br/>
agreements. 1 The instructions of Muhammad the prophet the apostle of <br/>
God to 'Amr b. Hazm when he sent him to the Yaman. He orders him <br/>
to observe piety to God in all his doings for God is with those who are <br/>
pious and who do well; 2 and he commanded him to behave with truth as <br/>
God commanded him; and that he should give people the good news and <br/>
command them to follow it and to teach men the Quran and instruct <br/>
them in it and to forbid men to do wrong so that none but the pure should <br/>
touch the Quran and should instruct men in their privileges and obliga¬ <br/>
tions and be lenient to them when they behave aright and severe on in¬ <br/>
justice, for God hates injustice and has forbidden it. ‘The curse of God is <br/>
on the evildoers.’ 3 Give men the good new's of paradise and the way to <br/>
earn it, and warn them of hell and the way to earn it, and make friends with <br/>
men so that they may be instructed in religion, and teach men the rites of <br/>
the hajj, its customs and its obligation and what God has ordered about it; <br/>
the greater hajj is the greater hajj and the lesser hajj is the ' umra and <br/>
prohibit men from praying in one small garment unless it be a garment <br/>
whose ends are double over their shoulders, and forbid men from squatting <br/>
in one garment w'hich exposes their person to the air, and forbid them to <br/>
twist the hair of the head (T. if it is long) on the back of the neck; 4 and <br/>
if there is a quarrel between men forbid them to appeal to tribes and <br/>
families, and let their appeal be to God; they who do not appeal to God <br/>
but to tribes and families let them be smitten wath the sword until their <br/>
appeal is made to God; and command men to perform the ablutions, their <br/>
faces, and their hands to the elbows and their feet to the ankles, and let <br/>
them wipe their heads as God has ordered; and command prayer at the <br/>
proper time with bowing, prostration, and humble reverence; prayer at 96a <br/>
daybreak, at noon when the sun declines, in the afternoon w'hen the sun <br/>
is descending, at even when the night Approaches not delaying it until the <br/>
stars appear in the sky; later at the beginning of the night; order them to <br/>
run to the mosques when they are summoned, and to wash when they go to <br/>
them, and order them to take from the booty God’s fifth and what alms are <br/>
enjoined on the Muslims from land—a tithe of what the fountains w r ater <br/>
(T. the ba'al waters) 5 and the sky waters, and a twentieth of what the <br/>
bucket waters; and for every ten camels two sheep; and for ever} 7 twenty </p>
<p>camels four sheep; for ever}" forty cows one cow; for every thirty cows a </p>
<p>bull or cow calf; for every forty sheep at grass one sheep; this is what God <br/>
has enjoined on the believers in the matter of alms. He who adds thereto <br/>
it is a merit to him. A Jew' or a Christian w'ho becomes a sincere Muslim </p>
<p>1 Sura 5. I. 2 Sura 16. 128. </p>
<p>3 Sura 5. 1. 4 i.e. to wear a pigtail. </p>
<p>s Here undoubtedly T- and Bal, 70 retain the original text. For the original sense of <br/>
Baal’s land see W, Robertson Smith, Religion of the Semites, pp. 98 f. Probably it means <br/>
land watered by underground streams. </p>
<p>648 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>of his own accord and obeys the religion of Islam is a believer with the <br/>
same rights and the same obligations. If one of them holds fast to his <br/>
religion he is not to be turned (T. seduced) from it. Every adult, male or <br/>
female, bond or free, must pay a golden dinar or its equivalent in clothes. <br/>
He who performs this has the guarantee of God and His apostle; he who <br/>
withholds it is the enemy of God and His apostle and all believers. </p>
<p>THE COMING OF RIFA'A B. ZAYD AL-JUDHAMl </p>
<p>Rifa'a b. Zayd al-judh 5 ml of the clan of al-Qubayb came to the apostle <br/>
during the armistice of al-Hudaybiya before Khaybar. He gave the apostle <br/>
a slave and he became a good Muslim. The apostle gave him a letter to <br/>
his people in which he wrote: 1 </p>
<p>To Rifa'a b. Zayd whom I have sent to his people and those who have <br/>
joined them to invite them to God and His apostle. Whosoever comes <br/>
forward is of the party of God and His apostle, and whosoever turns back </p>
<p>963 has two months’ grace. </p>
<p>When Rifa'a came to his people they responded and accepted Islam; <br/>
then they went to al-Harra, the Harra of al-Rajla’, and stopped there (897). </p>
<p>964 THE LIARS MUSAYLIMA AL-HANAFl AND AL-ASWAD </p>
<p>AL-‘ANSI </p>
<p>Now the two arch-liars Musaylima b. Habib and al-Aswad b. Ka'b al-'AnsI <br/>
had spoken during the apostle's lifetime, the first in al-Yamama among the <br/>
B. Hanlfa, and the second in San'a Yazid b. 'Abdullah b. Qusay$ told <br/>
me from 'At 5 ’ b. Yasar, or his brother Sulayman, from Abu Sa'id al- <br/>
Khudri, saying: ‘I heard the apostle as he was addressing the people from <br/>
his pulpit say “I saw the night of al-qadr and then I was made to <br/>
forget it; and I saw on my arms two bracelets of gold which I disliked <br/>
so I blew on them and they flew away. I interpreted it to mean these <br/>
two liars, the man of al-Yamama and the man of al-Yaman.” ’ </p>
<p>One whom I do not suspect on the authority of Abu Hurayra said: <br/>
‘I heard the apostle say: The hour will not come until thirty antichrists <br/>
come forth, each of them claiming to be a prophet.’ </p>
<p>965 THE SENDING OUT OF COLLECTORS OF THE POOR-TAX </p>
<p>The apostle sent out his officials and representatives to every district <br/>
subject to Islam to collect the poor-tax. He sent al-Muhajir b. Abu <br/>
Umayya b. al-Mughira to San'a’, and al-'Ansi came crut against him while <br/>
he was there. Ziyad b. Labid, brother of B. Bayada al-Ansarl, he sent to <br/>
Idadramaut. 'Adiy b. Hatim he sent to Tayyi’ and B. Asad; Malik b. <br/>
Nuwayra (898)^0 B. Hanzala. The poor-tax of B. Sa'd he divided between </p>
<p>1 I have omitted the introductory formula. </p>

<p>two men: Zibriqan b. Badr and Qays b. 'Asim each to be in charge of a <br/>
section; al-Ala b. al-Hadrami to al-Bahrayn, and 'All b. Abu Talib to <br/>
the people of Najran, to collect the poor-tax and to superintend the <br/>
collection of the poll-tax. </p>
<p>MUSAYLIMA’S LETTER AND THE APOSTLE’S ANSWER <br/>
THERETO </p>
<p>Musaylima had written to the apostle: ‘From Musaylima the apostle of <br/>
God to Muhammad the apostle of God. Peace upon you. I have been <br/>
made partner with you in authority. To us belongs half the land and to </p>
<p>Quraysh half, but Quraysh are a hostile people.’ Two messengers brought <br/>
this letter. b </p>
<p>A^shaykh of Ashja' told me on the authority of Salama b. Nu'aym b <br/>
Mas ud al-Ashja'I from his father Nu'aym: I heard the apostle saying to <br/>
them when he read his letter ‘What do you say about it ?’ They said that <br/>
they said the same as Musaylima. He replied, ‘By God, were it not that <br/>
heralds are not to be killed I would behead the pair of you!’ Then he wrote <br/>
to Musaylima: ‘From Muhammad the apostle of God to Musaylima the <br/>
liar. Peace be upon him who follows the guidance. 1 The earth is God’s <br/>
He lets whom He will of His creatures inherit it and the result is to the <br/>
pious. 2 This was at the end of the year 10. </p>
<p>THE FAREWELL PILGRIMAGE 9 66 </p>
<p>In the beginning of Dhu’l-Qa'da the apostle prepared to make the pil¬ <br/>
grimage and ordered the men to get ready. </p>
<p>Abdu 1 -Rahman b. al-Qasim from his father al-Qasim b. Muhammad <br/>
from A’isha the prophet’s wife told me that the apostle went on pil¬ <br/>
grimage on the 25th Dhu’l-Qa'da (899). </p>
<p>Neither he nor the men spoke of anything but the pilgrimage, until <br/>
w en he was in Sarif and had brought the victims with him as also some <br/>
dignitaries had done, he ordered the people to remove their pilgrim gar¬ <br/>
ments except those who brought victims. That day my menses were upon <br/>
me and he came in to me as I was weeping and asked me what ailed me <br/>
guessing correctly what was the matter. I told him he was right and said I <br/>
wished to God that I had not come out with him on the journey this year. </p>
<p>He said (T. Don’t do that) ‘Don’t say that, for you can do all that the <br/>
pilgrims do except go round the temple.’ The apostle entered Mecca and <br/>
everyone who had no sacrificial victim, and his wives, took off the pilgrim <br/>
garment. When the day of sacrifice came I was sent a lot of beef and it <br/>
was put in my house. When I asked what it was they said that the apostle <br/>
had sacrificed cows on behalf of his wives. When the night that the pebbles </p>
<p>1 Cf. Sura 20. 49, </p>
<p>2 Cf. Sura 7. 125. </p>
<p>650 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>were thrown duly came the apostle sent me along with my brother <br/>
'Abdu’l-Rahman and let me perform the 'umra from al-Tan'im in place <br/>
of the 'umra which I had missed. </p>
<p>Nafi', client of 'Abdullah b. 'Umar from 'Abdullah, fromHafsa d. 'Umar, <br/>
said that when the apostle ordered his wives to remove the pilgrim gar¬ <br/>
ments they asked him what prevented him from doing the same and he <br/>
said: 'I have sent on my victims and have matted 1 my hair, but I shall not <br/>
be free of the ihrdm until I slaughter my victims.’ </p>
<p>967 'Abdullah b. Abu Najlh told me that the apostle had sent 'All to Najran <br/>
and met him in Mecca when he was still in a state of ihram. He went in to <br/>
Fatima the apostle’s daughter and found her dressed in her ordinary <br/>
clothes. When he asked why, she told him that the apostle had ordered <br/>
his wives so to do. Then he went to the apostle and reported the result of <br/>
his journey and he told him to go and circumambulate the temple and <br/>
remove the pilgrim garb as the others had done. He said that he wanted <br/>
to slaughter a victim as the apostle did. The apostle again told him to <br/>
remove the pilgrim garb. He replied: ‘I said when I put on the pilgrim <br/>
garb, “O God, I will invoke thy name over a victim as your prophet and <br/>
your slave and your apostle Muhammad does.” ’ When he asked him if he <br/>
had a victim he said that he had not, and the apostle gave him a share <br/>
in his, so he retained the pilgrim garb with the apostle until both of them <br/>
had completed the pilgrimage and the apostle slaughtered the victim on <br/>
behalf of them both. </p>
<p>Yahya b. 'Abdullah b. 'Abdu’l-Rahman b. Abu 'Amra from Yazld b. <br/>
Talha b. Yazid b. Rukana told me that when 'All came from the Yaman to <br/>
meet; the apostle in Mecca he hurried to him and left in charge of his army <br/>
one of his companions who went and covered every man in the force with <br/>
clothes from the linen 'All had. When the army approached he went <br/>
out to meet them and found them dressed in the clothes. When he asked <br/>
what on earth had happened the man said that he had dressed the men so <br/>
that they might appear seemly when they mingled with the people. He <br/>
told him to take off the clothes before they came to the apostle and they <br/>
did so and put them back among the spoil. The army showed resentment <br/>
at their treatment. </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. 'Abdu’l-Rahman b. Ma'mar b. Hazm from Sulayman b. <br/>
Muhammad b. Ka'b b. 'Ujra from his aunt Zaynab d. Ka'b who was </p>
<p>968 married to Abu Sa'Id al-Khudri, on the authority of the latter told me that <br/>
when the men complained of 'All the apostle arose to address them and he <br/>
heard him say: 'Do not blame All, for he is too scrupulous in the things <br/>
of God, or in the way of God, to be blamed.’ </p>
<p>Then the apostle continued his pilgrimage and showed the men the <br/>
rites and taught them the customs of their hajj . 2 He made a speech in </p>
<p>1 labbadtu is explained in the Nihaya of Ibnu’J-Athir as a sort of gum that is put on the <br/>
hair to prevent it becoming dishevelled and lousy. </p>
<p>1 Cf. Musi b. 'Uqba, No. 17. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 651 </p>
<p>which he made things clear. He praised and glorified God, then he said: </p>
<p>‘O men, listen to my words. I do not know whether I shall ever meet you <br/>
in this place again after this year. Your blood and your property are <br/>
sacrosanct until you meet your Lord, as this day and this month are holy. </p>
<p>You will surely meet your Lord and He will ask you of your works. I have <br/>
told you. He who has a pledge let him return it to him who entrusted him <br/>
with it; all usury is abolished, but you have your capital. Wrong not and <br/>
you shall not be wronged. God has decreed that there is to be no usury <br/>
and the usury of 'Abbas b. 'Abdu’l-Muttalib is abolished, all of it. All <br/>
blood shed in the pagan period is to be left unavenged. The first claim on <br/>
blood I abolish is that of b. Rabi'a b. al-Harith b. 'Abdu’l-Muttalib (who <br/>
was fostered among the B. Layth and whom Hudhayl killed). It is the <br/>
first blood shed in the pagan period which I deal with. Satan despairs <br/>
of ever being worshipped in your land, but if he can be obeyed in anything <br/>
short of worship he will be pleased in matters you may be disposed to <br/>
think of little account, so beware of him in your religion. “Postponement of <br/>
a sacred month is only an excess of disbelief whereby those who disbelieve <br/>
are misled; they allow it one year and forbid it another year that they may <br/>
make up the number of the months w r hich God has hallowed, so that they <br/>
permit what God has forbidden, and forbid what God has allowed.” 1 <br/>
Time has completed its cycle and is as it was on the day that God created <br/>
the heavens and the earth. The number of months with God is twelve; 969 <br/>
four of them are sacred, three consecutive and the Rajab of Mudar, 2 <br/>
which is between Jumada and Sha'ban. </p>
<p>You have rights over your wives and they have rights over you. You <br/>
have the right that they should not defile your bed and that they should <br/>
not behave with open unseemliness. If they do, God allows you to put <br/>
them in separate rooms and to beat them but not with severity. If they <br/>
refrain from these things they have the right to their food and clothing <br/>
with kindness. Lay injunctions on women kindly, for they are prisoners <br/>
w r ith you having no control- of their persons. You have taken them only <br/>
as a trust from God, 3 and you have the enjoyment of their persons by the <br/>
words of God, so understand (T. and listen to) my words, O men, for <br/>
I have told you. I have left with you something which if you will hold <br/>
fast to it you will never fall into error—a plain indication, the book of <br/>
God and the practice of His prophet, so give good heed to what I say. </p>
<p>Know that every Muslim is a Muslim’s brother, and that the Muslims <br/>
are brethren. It is only law’ful to take from a brother what he gives you <br/>
willingly, so wrong not yourselves. O God, have I not told you ? </p>
<p>. 1 Sura 9. 37, </p>
<p>1 A.Dh. explains that it was so called because Mudar used to treat it as sacred while <br/>
other Arabs did not. (I suspect that in Bronnle's edition, p. 449, takhdumuhu is a mistake </p>
<p>for tuharrimuhu.) </p>
<p>3 bi amanatf Hah, This is a difficult phrase. It is probably to be understood in the sense <br/>
of Sura 8. 27 and more particularly 33. 72 where the Quranic commentators differ widely. </p>
<p>See Tane, 102a. </p>
<p>652 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>I was told that the men said ‘0 God, yes,’ and the apostle said ‘O God, <br/>
bear witness.’ </p>
<p>Yahya b. 'Abbad b. 'Abdullah b. al-Zubayr from his father told me that <br/>
the man who used to act as crier for the apostle when he was on 'Arafa <br/>
was Rabl'a b. Umayya b. Khalaf. The apostle said to him, ‘Say: O men, <br/>
the apostle of God says, Do you know what month this is?’ and they <br/>
would say the holy month. Then he said, ‘Say to them: God has hallowed <br/>
your blood and your property until you meet your Lord like the sanctity <br/>
of this month. Do you know what country this is?’ And they said ‘The <br/>
holy land’ and he said the same as before. Do you know what day this is ? </p>
<p>970 and they said the day of the great hajj, and he said the same again. </p>
<p>Layth b. Abu Sulaym from Shahr b. Haushab al-Ash'ari from 'Amr <br/>
b. Kharija told me: 'Attab b. Usayd sent me to the apostle on a matter <br/>
while the apostle was standing on 'Arafa. I came to him and stood beneath <br/>
his camel and its foam was falling on my head. I heard him say: ‘God <br/>
has assigned to everyone his due. Testamentary bequests to an heir are <br/>
not lawful. The child belongs to the bed and the adulterer must be <br/>
stoned. He who claims as father him who is not his father, or a client a <br/>
master who is not his master, on him rests the curse of God, the angels, <br/>
and men everyw here. God will not receive from him compensatory atone¬ <br/>
ment, however great.’ </p>
<p>‘Abdullah b. Abu Najih told me that when the apostle stood on 'Arafa <br/>
he said, ‘This station goes with the mountain that is above it and all <br/>
'Arafa is a station.’ When he stood on Quzah on the morning of al- <br/>
Muzdalifa he said, ‘This is the station and all al-Muzdalifa is a station.’ <br/>
Then when he had slaughtered in the slaughtering place in Mina he said, <br/>
‘This is the slaughtering place and all Mina is a slaughtering place.’ The <br/>
apostle completed the hajj and showed men the rites, and taught them <br/>
what God had prescribed as to their hajj, the station, the throwing of <br/>
stones, the circumambulation of the temple, and what He had permitted <br/>
and forbidden. It “was the pilgrimage of completion and the pilgrimage <br/>
of farewell because the apostle did not go on pilgrimage after that. </p>
<p>THE SENDING OF USAMA B. ZAYD TO PALESTINE </p>
<p>Then the apostle returned and stopped in Medina for the rest of Dhu’l- <br/>
Idijja, Muharram, and Safar. He ordered the people to make an expedition <br/>
to Syria and put over them Usama b. Zayd b. Haritha, his freed slave. <br/>
He ordered him to lead his cavalry into the territory of the Balqa’ and <br/>
al-Darum in the land of Palestine. The men got ready and all the first <br/>
emigrants went with Usama (900). </p>
<p>MESSENGERS SENT TO THE VARIOUS KINGDOMS </p>
<p>T- 1560 (T. As to 1 . 1 . according to what I. Hamid alleged and told us saying </p>
<p>that Salama had it from him, he said: The apostle had sent out some of </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 653 </p>
<p>his companions in different directions to the kings of the Arabs and the <br/>
non-Arabs inviting them to Islam in the period between al-Hudaybiya <br/>
and his death.) </p>
<p>Yazid b. Abu Habib al-Misri told me that he found a document in 97a <br/>
which was a memorandum (T. the names) of those the apostle sent to the <br/>
countries and kings of the Arabs and non-Arabs and what he said to his <br/>
companions when he sent them. I sent it to Muhammad b. Shihab <br/>
al-Zuhrl (T. with a trusty countryman of his) and he recognized it. It <br/>
contained the statement that the apostle went out to his companions and <br/>
said: ‘God has sent me as a mercy to all men, so take a message from me, </p>
<p>God have mercy on you. Do not hang back from me 1 as the disciples <br/>
hung back from Jesus son of Mary.’ They asked how they had hung back <br/>
and he said, ‘He called them to a task similar to that to which I have called <br/>
you. Those who had to go a short journey were pleased and accepted; <br/>
those who had a long journey before them were displeased and refused to <br/>
go, and Jesus complained of them to God. (T. From that very night) <br/>
every one of them was able to speak the language of the people to whom he <br/>
was sent.’ (T. Jesus said ‘This is a thing which God has determined that <br/>
you should do, so go.’) </p>
<p>Those whom Jesus son of Mary sent, both disciples and those who <br/>
came after them, in the land were: Peter the disciple and Paul with him, </p>
<p>(Paul belonged to the followers and was not a disciple) to Rome; Andrew <br/>
and Matthew to the land of the cannibals; Thomas to the land of Babel <br/>
which is in the land of the east; Philip to Carthage which is Africa; John <br/>
to Ephesus the city of the young men of the cave; James to Jerusalem which <br/>
is Aelia the city of the sanctuary; Bartholomew to Arabia which is the <br/>
land of the Hijaz; Simon to the land of the Berbers; Judah who was not <br/>
one of the disciples was put in the place of Judas. 2 </p>
<p>(T. Then the apostle divided his companions and sent Salit b. 'Amr b. T- 156c <br/>
Abdu Shams b. 'Abdu Wudd, brother of B. 'Amir b. Lu’ayy, to Haudha <br/>
b. All ruler of al-Yamama; al-'Ala’ b. al-Hadramt to al-Mundhir b. </p>
<p>Sawa, brother of B. 'Abdu’I-Qays, ruler of al-Bahrayn; 'Amr b. al-'As to <br/>
Jayfar b. Julanda and 'Abbad his brother the Asdls, rulers of ’Uman; </p>
<p>Hatib b. Abu Balta'a to the Muqauqis ruler of Alexandria. He handed <br/>
over to him the apostle’s letter and the Muqauqis gave to the apostle <br/>
four slave girls, one of whom was Mary mother of Ibrahim the apostle’s <br/>
son; Dihya b. Khalifa al-Kalbl al-Khazrajl he sent to Caesar, who was <br/>
Heraclius king of Rome. When he came to him with the apostle’s letter <br/>
he looked at it and then put it between his thighs and his ribs.) 3 </p>
<p>(T. Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri from 'Ubaydullah b. 'Abdullah b. 'Utba b. T- 1561 </p>
<p>1 Or, perhaps, ‘differ in your response to me’. </p>
<p>The forms of the names shows that the source was Greek. It probably came to 1.1, <br/>
through Syriac. </p>
<p>3 From this point to the summary of the prophet’s raids X-’ s extracts, pp. 1560 f. ( from <br/>
the lost work of 1 . 1 . are given. Doubtless I.H. omitted them for the reasons given in his <br/>
Introduction. </p>
<p>654 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Mas'ud from 'Abdullah b. 'Abbas from Abu Sufyan b. Harb told me, <br/>
saying, ‘We were a merchant people and the war between us and the <br/>
apostle had shut us in until our goods were stale. When there was an <br/>
armistice between us we felt sure that we should be safe. So I went out <br/>
with a number of Quraysh merchants to Syria making for Gaza. We got <br/>
there when Heraclius had conquered the Persians who were in his territory <br/>
and driven them out and recaptured from them his great cross which they <br/>
had plundered. When he had thus got the better of them and heard that <br/>
his cross had been recovered he came out from Hims, which was his <br/>
headquarters, walking on foot in thanks to God for what He had restored to <br/>
him, so that he could pray in the holy city. 1 Carpets were spread for him <br/>
and aromatic herbs w r ere thrown on them. When he came to Aelia and had <br/>
finished praying there with his patricians and the Roman nobles he became <br/>
sorrowful, turning his eyes to heaven; and his patricians said, “You have <br/>
become very sorrowful this morning, O king.” He said, “Yes, in a vision <br/>
of the night I saw the kingdom of a circumcised man victorious.” They <br/>
said that they did not know a people w T ho circumcised themselves except <br/>
the Jews and they were under his sovereignty. They recommended him <br/>
to send orders to everyone of authority in his dominions to behead every <br/>
Jew and thus rid himself of his anxiety. And by God as they were trying <br/>
to induce him to do this, lo the messenger of the governor of Busra came <br/>
in leading a man 'while the princes were exchanging new r s, and said, “This <br/>
man, O king, is from the Arabs, people of sheep and camels. He speaks <br/>
of something wonderful that has happened in his country, so ask him <br/>
about it.” Accordingly the king asked his interpreter to inquire what had <br/>
happened and the man said, “A man appeared among us alleging that he <br/>
was a prophet. Some followed and believed him; others opposed him. <br/>
Fights between them occurred in many places, and I left them thus.” <br/>
When he had given his news the king told them to strip him; they did so, <br/>
and lo he was circumcised. Heraclius said, “This, by God, is the vision <br/>
I saw; not w r hat you say. Give him his clothes. Be off with you.” Then <br/>
T. 1563 he summoned his chief of police and told him to turn Syria upside down <br/>
until he brought him a man of the people of that man, meaning the pro¬ <br/>
phet. We were in Gaza when the chief of police came down upon us <br/>
asking if we were of the people of this man in the Hijaz; and learning that <br/>
we were he told us to come to the king, and when we came to him he asked <br/>
if we were of the clan of this man and which was the nearest of kin to him. <br/>
I said that I was, and by God I have never seen a man whom I consider <br/>
more shrewd than that uncircumcised man, meaning Heraclius. He told <br/>
me to approach and sat me in front of him with my companions behind me. <br/>
Then he said, “I will interrogate him, and if he lies confute him.” But, <br/>
by God, if I were to lie they could not confute me. But I am a man of <br/>
high birth too honourable to lie and I knew that it was only too easy for <br/>
them, if I lied to him, to remember it against me and to repeat it in my <br/>
1 The cross was recovered from the Persians by Heraclius in a.d. 628. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 655 </p>
<p>name, so I did not lie to him. He said, “Tell me about this man who has <br/>
appeared among you making these claims,” I began to belittle him and to <br/>
speak disparagingly of his affair and to say, “Don’t let him cause you <br/>
anxiety; his importance is less than you have heard,” but he took no heed. </p>
<p>Then he said, Tell me what I ask you about him.” I told him to ask <br/>
what he liked and he asked about his lineage among us. I told him it was <br/>
pure; our best lineage. Then he asked if any of his house had made the <br/>
same claims which he was copying. When I said No he asked if he possessed <br/>
any sovereignty among us which we had robbed him of and had he made <br/>
this claim so that we might return it to him ? Again I said No. Then he <br/>
asked about the character of his followers. I told him that they were the <br/>
weak and poor and young slaves and young women; not one of the elders <br/>
and nobles of his people followed him. Then he asked whether those who <br/>
followed him loved him and stuck to him or despised him and left him, <br/>
and I told him that none of his followers had left him. Then he asked T- 1564 <br/>
about the war between us and him. I said that its fortunes varied. Then <br/>
he asked if he was treacherous. This was the only question of his which I <br/>
found fault with. I said No, and that while we had an armistice with <br/>
him we did not fear treachery; but he paid no attention to what I said. </p>
<p>Then he summed up and said: “I asked you about his lineage and you <br/>
alleged that it was pure and of your best and God chooses only a man of <br/>
the noblest lineage as a prophet. Then I asked if any man of his family <br/>
made similar claims and you said No. Then I asked if he had been robbed <br/>
of dominion and made this claim to recover it, and you said No. Then <br/>
I asked you about his followers and you said that they were the weak and <br/>
poor and young slaves and women, and such have been the followers of the <br/>
prophets in all ages. Then I asked if his followers left him and you said <br/>
None. Thus is the sweetness of faith: it does not enter the heart and <br/>
depart. Then I asked if he was treacherous and you said No; and truly <br/>
if you have told me the truth about him he will conquer me on the ground <br/>
that is beneath my feet, and I wish that I were with him that I might wash <br/>
his feeL Go about your business.’ So I got up rubbing my hands together T- 1565 <br/>
and saying that the affair of I bn Abu Kabsha had become great in that the <br/>
kings of the Greeks dreaded him in their sovereignty in Syria. The <br/>
apostle s letter with Dihya b. Khalifa al-Kalbi came to him saying, “If you <br/>
accept Islam you will be safe; if you accept Islam God w T ill give you a <br/>
double reward; if you turn back the sin of the husbandmen 1 w T ill be upon <br/>
you,” i.e. the burden of it/ </p>
<p>From al-Zuhri from 'Ubaydullah from 'Abdullah b. 'Utba from Ibn <br/>
Abbas, who said: Abu Sufyan b. Harb told me practically the same story. </p>
<p>Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri told me that he met a Christian bishop in the time <br/>
of ‘Abdu’l-Malik b. Marwan who told him that he knew about the affair <br/>
of the apostle and Heraclius and understood it. When the apostle’s letter <br/>
by Dihya came to him he took it and put it between his thighs and his </p>
<p>1 This appears to be an allusion to Matt. xxi. 33 f. </p>
<p>656 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>ribs. Then he wrote to a man in Rome 1 who used to read in Hebrew what <br/>
T- 1566 they read telling him about his affair and describing his circumstances <br/>
and telling him about what had come from him. The man in Rome <br/>
replied that he is the prophet whom we expect: there is no doubt about it, <br/>
so follow him and believe in him. So Heraclius ordered the Roman generals <br/>
to assemble in a room and commanded that the doors should be fastened. <br/>
Then he looked down on them from an upper chamber (for he was afraid <br/>
of them) and said: ‘O Romans, I have brought you together for a good <br/>
purpose. This man has written me a letter summoning me to his religion. <br/>
By God, he is truly the prophet whom we expect and find in our books, so <br/>
come and let us follow him and believe in him that it may be well with us in <br/>
this world and the next.’ As one man they uttered cries of disgust and <br/>
ran to the doors to get out, but found them bolted. He ordered that they <br/>
should be brought back to him, fearing for his life, and said: T spoke these <br/>
words that I might see the firmness of your religion in face of what has <br/>
happened, and I am delighted with what I have seen of your behaviour.’ <br/>
They fell down in obeisance and he ordered that the doors should be <br/>
opened and they went off. </p>
<p>A traditionist said that Heraclius said to Dihya b. Khalifa when he <br/>
brought the apostle’s letter: ‘Alas, I know that your master is a prophet <br/>
sent (by God) and that it is he whom we expect and find in our book, but <br/>
I go in fear of my life from the Romans; but for that I would follow him. <br/>
Go to Paghatir the bishop and tell him about your master, for he is <br/>
greater among the Romans than I, and his word counts for more than <br/>
T- 1567 mine. See what he says to you.’ So Dihya went and told him about <br/>
what he had brought from the apostle and of his invitation to Heraclius. <br/>
iPaghafir said: ‘Your master is a prophet who has been sent; we know <br/>
him by his description, and we find him mentioned by name in our <br/>
scriptures.’ Then he went and discarded his black clothes and put on <br/>
white garments and took his staff and went out to the Romans who were in <br/>
church and said: ‘O Romans, a letter has come to us from Ahmad in <br/>
which he calls us to God and I bear witness that there is no God but <br/>
Allah and that Ahmad is his slave and apostle.’ They leapt upon him <br/>
with one accord and beat him until he was dead. When Dihya returned to <br/>
Heraclius and told him the news he said: ‘I told you that we feared death <br/>
at their hands and Daghatir was greater among them and his word counted <br/>
for more than mine.’ </p>
<p>From Khalid b. Yasar from one of the first people of Syria: When <br/>
Heraclius wanted to go from Syria to Constantinople when he heard <br/>
about the apostle he gathered the Romans together and said: ‘I am laying <br/>
before you some matters which I want to carry out. You know that this <br/>
man is a prophet who has been sent; w r e find him in our book; we know <br/>
him by his description, so come and let us follow him that it may be well <br/>
with us in this world and the next.’ They said, ‘Are we to be under the </p>

<p>I was told that the Negus sent his son with sixty Abyssinians by boat, <br/>
and when they were in the middle of the sea the boat foundered and they <br/>
all perished .) 1 </p>
<p>T- 1572 (T. via Salama. From 'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr from al-Zuhrl from Abu </p>
<p>Salama from 'Abdu’l-Rahman b. 'Auf. 'Abdullah b. Hudhafa brought the <br/>
apostle’s letter to Chosroes and when he had read it he tore it up. When <br/>
the apostle heard that he had torn his letter up he said, ‘His kingdom will <br/>
be torn in pieces.’) </p>
<p>(T. via Yazid b. Abu Habib. Then Chosroes wrote to Badhan, who was <br/>
governor of the Yaman, ‘Send two stout fellows to this man in the Hijaz <br/>
and tell them to bring him to me.* So Badhan sent his steward Babawayh <br/>
T- 1573 who was a skilled scribe with a Persian called Kharkhasrah to carry a <br/>
letter to the apostle ordering him to go with them to Chosroes. He told <br/>
Babawayh to go to this man’s country and speak to him and then come back <br/>
and report. When they got as far as al-Ta’if they found some men of <br/>
Quraysh in (wadi) Nakhb and inquired about him. They told them that he <br/>
was in Medina. They rejoiced at meeting these men, saying, ‘This is <br/>
good news, for Chosroes king of kings is moved against the man and you <br/>
will be rid of him.’ </p>
<p>The two men came to the apostle and Babawayh told him that Shahan¬ <br/>
shah king of kings Chosroes had written to the governor 2 Badhan ordering <br/>
him to send men to bring him to him and that they had been sent to take <br/>
him away. If he obeyed, Badhan would write to the king of kings on his <br/>
behalf and keep him from him; but if he refused to come he knew what <br/>
sort of man he was: he would destroy his people and lay waste his country. <br/>
They had come in to the apostle’s presence with shaven beards and long <br/>
moustaches, so that he could not bear to look at them. He advanced on <br/>
them and said, ‘Who ordered you to do this?’ To which they replied, <br/>
‘Our Lord’ meaning Chosroes. The apostle answered, ‘But my Lord <br/>
has ordered me to let my beard grow long and to cut my moustache.’ <br/>
Then he told them to come back in the morning. </p>
<p>News came from heaven to the apostle to the effect that God had given <br/>
Shirawayh power over his father Chosroes and he had killed him on a <br/>
T- 1574 certain night of a certain month at a certain hour. Thereupon he sum¬ <br/>
moned them and told them. They said: ‘ Do you know what you are saying ? <br/>
We can take revenge on you. What is easier? Shall we write this as from <br/>
you and tell the king of it?’ He said, ‘Yes, tell him that from me and tell <br/>
him that my religion and my sovereignty will reach limits which the king- </p>

summary to this section. I have omitted X- I 574-.4-1575. 5 because it is unintelligible <br/>

<p>A SUMMARY OF THE EXPEDITIONS AND RAIDING <br/>
PARTIES </p>
<p>These were thirty-eight (T. thirty-five) in number (T. between the time <br/>
of h s coming to Medina and his death). 'Ubayda b. al-Harith was sent <br/>
“ the lower part (T. to the tribes) of Thaniyatu'l-Mara (f . which is a <br/>
well in the Hijaz); Hamza b. ‘Abdu’l-Muttalib to the coast in the direction <br/>
of al-'Is (Some people date Hamza’s raid before that of Ubayda); Sa d <br/>
b Aba Waqq* to ahKharrar (T. in the Hijaz); ’Abdullah b Jahsh to <br/>
Nakhla • Zayd b. Haritha to al-Qarda (T. a well in Najd), Muhamma b. <br/>
Maslama’s attack on Ka’b b. al-Ashraf; Marthad b. Abu Marthad al- <br/>
Ghanawl to al-Raji’; al-Mundhir b. ’Amr to Bi’r Ma Qtia; Abu Ubayda b <br/>
al-Jarrah to Dhu’l-Qassa on the Iraq road; Umar b al-Khattab to Turba <br/>
in the B. 'Amir country; 'All b. Abu Tall) to the Yaman, Ghal.b b. <br/>
'Abdullah al-Kalbi, the Kalb of Layth, to al-Kadid where he smote B. </p>
<p>al-Mulawwah. </p>
<p>GHALIB’s RAID ON THE B. AL-MULAWWAH <br/>
Ya'qub b. ‘Utba b. al-Mughira b. al-Akhnas from Muslim b- 'Abdullah <br/>
974 b. Khubayb al-Juhani from al-Mundhir from Jundab b Makith aLJuham <br/>
told me that the latter said: The apostle sent Ghalib b. Abdulla a- <br/>
Kalb! Kalb of B. 'Auf b. Layth, on a night raid in which I took part. <br/>
He ordered him to make a cavalry raid on B. al-Mulawwah who were m <br/>
al-Kadid We went out and when we reached Qudayd we fell in with <br/>
al-Harith b. Malik b. al-Barsa’ al-Laythl and seized him He saidl that he <br/>
had come to be a Muslim and was going to the apostle. We told him that <br/>
if he was a Muslim it would not hurt him to be tied up for a night, and it </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 661 </p>
<p>he were not we should make sure of him; so we bound him tightly and <br/>
left him in charge of a young negro and told him to cut off his head if he <br/>
tried to attack him. </p>
<p>We went on until we came to (T. the valley of) al-Kadid at sunset. We <br/>
were in the wadi and my companions sent me on to scout for them. So <br/>
I left them and went on until I came to a hill overlooking the enemy’s <br/>
camp. I went up to the top and looked down at the camp; and by God as <br/>
I was lying on the hill out came a man from his tent and said to his wife, </p>
<p>T see something black on the hill which I didn’t see at the beginning of the <br/>
day. Look and see if any of your gear is missing; perhaps the dogs have <br/>
dragged off something.’ She w r ent to look and told him that nothing was <br/>
missing. He then told her to fetch him his bow and a couple of arrows and <br/>
he shot me in the side. I pulled out the arrow and laid it aside and kept <br/>
my place (T. did not move). Then he shot me again in my shoulder. <br/>
Again I pulled it out and kept my place. He said to his wife, ‘If this had <br/>
been a scout of some party he would have moved, for both my arrows hit <br/>
him; in the morning go and get them. Don’t let the dogs gnaw them.’ <br/>
Then he went inside his tent. </p>
<p>We^gave them time until they quietened down and went to sleep (T. <br/>
until their cattle returned in the evening and they milked them and lay <br/>
down quietly, and a third of the night passed) and towards dawn we <br/>
attacked them and killed some and drove off the cattle. They cried out to <br/>
one another for aid, and a multitude that we could not resist came at us <br/>
(T. omits and has ‘and we went on quickly until we passed by al-Harith’) <br/>
and we went on with the cattle and passed lbn al-Barsa’ and his companion <br/>
and carried them along with us. The enemy were hard on our heels and only <br/>
the Wadi Qudayd was between us, when God sent a flood in the wadi <br/>
from whence He pleased, for there veere no clouds that we could see and 975 <br/>
no rain. It brought such w^ater that none could resist it and none could <br/>
pass over. And there they stood looking at us as we drove off their cattle. </p>
<p>Not one of them could cross to us as we hurried off with them until we <br/>
got away; they could not pursue us, and we brought them to the apostle. </p>
<p>A man of Aslam on the authority of another of them told me that the <br/>
war-cry of the apostle’s companions that night was Slay! Slay! A rajiz <br/>
of the Muslims who was driving the cattle rhymed: </p>
<p>Abii’I-Qasim refused to let you graze <br/>
On luscious herbs which you amaze <br/>
With yellow tops the colour of maize (901). </p>
<p>I will now continue the summary of the night raids and raiding parties: 1 <br/>
'Ali to B, 'Abdullah b. Sa'd of Fadak; Abu’l-'Auja’ al-Sulaml to B; <br/>
Sulaym country where he and all his companions were killed; 'Ukkasha <br/>

<p>1 From C. The whole passage in T. 1598 f. differs in phraseology though not in content <br/>
from I.H. who has apparently edited the text freely. </p>
<p>662 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>of B. Asad in the direction of Najd. Mas'ud b. 'Urwa was killed there; <br/>
Muhammad b. Maslama, brother of b. Haritha, to al-Qurata’ of Hawazin; <br/>
Bashir b. Sa'd to B. Murra in Fadak; Bashir b. Sa'd in the direction of <br/>
Khaybar; Zayd b. Haritha to al-Jamum in B. Sulaym country; Zayd also <br/>
to Judham in Khushayn country. So says Ibn Hisham, but al-Shafi'I <br/>
from 'Amr b. Habib from Ibn Ishaq say ‘in Hisma country’. </p>
<p>THE RAID OF ZAYD B. HARITHA AGAINST JUDHAM </p>
<p>One whom I can trust told me from some men of Judham who knew about <br/>
the affair that Rifa'a b. Zayd al-Judhami when he came to his people with <br/>
the apostle’s letter inviting them to Islam and they accepted it, was soon <br/>
followed by Dihya b. Khalifa al-Kalbi who came from Caesar, king of the <br/>
976 Greeks, whom the apostle had sent having with him some merchandise <br/>
of his. When he reached one of their wadis called Shanar, al-Hunayd b. <br/>
'Os and his son 'Os of Dulay' a clan of Judham attacked Dihya and seized <br/>
everything he had with him. News of this reached some of al-Dubayb of <br/>
the kin of Rifa'a b. Zayd who had become Muslims and they went after <br/>
al-Hunayd and his son; al-Nu'man b. Abu Ji'al of B. al-Dubayb was <br/>
among them. They fell in with them and a skirmish took place. On that <br/>
day Qurra b. Ashqar aLDifari of the clan al-Dulay' proclaimed his <br/>
origin and said, ‘I am the son of Lubna,’ and shot al-Nu'man b. Abu <br/>
Ji'al with an arrow, hitting him in the knee, saying, ‘Take that! I am the <br/>
son of Lubna.’ Lubna was his mother. Now Hassan b. Milla al-Dubaybl <br/>
had been a friend of Dihya before that and he had taught him the first <br/>
sura of the Quran (902). They recovered what Hunayd and his son had <br/>
taken and restored it to Dihya, and Dihya went off and told the apostle <br/>
what had happened and asked him to let him kill al-Hunayd and his son. <br/>
The apostle sent Zayd b. Haritha against them and that was what provoked <br/>
the raid of Zayd on Judham. He sent a force with him. Ghatafan of <br/>
Judham and Wa’il and they of Salaman and Sa'd b. Hudhaym set off when <br/>
Rifa'a b. Zayd came to them with the apostle’s letter and halted in the <br/>
lava belt of al-Bajla’, while Rifa'a was in Kura' Rabba, knowing nothing, <br/>
with some of the B. al-Dubayb v'hile the rest of B. Dubayb were in <br/>
Wadi Madan in the region of the lava belt where it flows to the east. <br/>
Zayd’s force came up from the direction of al-Aulaj and attacked al-Maqis <br/>
from the harra. They rounded up the cattle and men they found and killed <br/>
al-Hunayd and his son and two men of B. al-Ahnaf (903), and one of B. <br/>
qyj al-Khasib. When B. al-Dubayb and the force in Fayfa’u Madan heard of <br/>
this some of them went off, among those who rode with them being <br/>
Hassan b. Milla on a horse belonging to Suwayd b. Zayd called al-'Ajaja, <br/>
and Unayf b. Milla on a horse of Milla’s called Righal, and Abu Zayd b. <br/>
'Amr on a horse called Shamir. They went on until they came near the <br/>
army when Abu Zayd and Hassan said to Unayf b. Milla, ‘Leave us and go, <br/>
for we are afraid of your tongue.’ (T. So he withdrew 7 ) and stopped near </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 663 </p>
<p>them. Hardly had they left him when his horse began to paw the ground <br/>
and rear and he said (to it), ‘I am more tnteres.ed in the two men than you <br/>
in the two horses. He let her go until he overtook them and they said to <br/>
djh ‘' eU K g J h , at bavc , behaved thus ' spare us your tongue and don’t </p>
<p>HalSn h b M lud  toda &gt;’’ , Thc 3 ' a S reed among themselves that only <br/>
Hassan should speak. Now they had a word which they used in the pagan </p>
<p>period Which they learned one from another: if one wanted to smiteLdth <br/>
his sword he said Bun or Thuri. When they came near the army the men <br/>
came running to them and Hassan said to them, ‘We are Muslims ’ The <br/>
first man to meet them was on a black horse (T. with lance outstretched T - <br/>
the man who displayed it had as it were fixed it on the withers of his horse '' </p>
<p>n h 'r Cr ‘j &lt; !n- FO , I y ard ’ outstri P them! ’) and he advanced driving them <br/>
Lnayf said Bun, but Hassan said ‘Gently.’ When they stopped by Zavd </p>
<p>b. Haritha Hassan said, We are Muslims.’ Zayd said, ‘Then recite the </p>

<p>Hassan’s sister, the wife of Abu Wabr b. 'Adiy b. Umayya b al-Dubavb <br/>

<p>of the army heard this and told Zayd and he gave orders th* the hands of <br/>

those who went were Abu Zayd b. 'Amr; Abu Shammas b. 'Amr; Smvayd </p>

man looked at them and told them not to make their camels kneeUest <br/>
fiheir legs should be cut off. So they dismounted, leaving them standing <br/>
hen they entered the mosque and the apostle saw them he beckoned to <br/>
them ,0 advance; and as Rifa'a began to speak a man said, ’Apostle, these </p>
<p>Or ‘on the top of’. </p>
<p>664 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>men are sorcerers,’ and repeated the accusation twice. Rifa a said, God <br/>
be gracious to him who treats us well today.’ Then he handed the apostle <br/>
the letter which he had written to him, saying, Take it, O apostle, it was <br/>
written long since but its violation is recent.’ I he apostle told a young <br/>
man to read it openly, and when he had done so he asked what had <br/>
happened, and they told him. Three times he said, W'hat am I to do about <br/>
the slain?’ Rifa'a answered, ‘You know best, O apostle. We do not regard <br/>
as wrong what you think is right or the converse.’ Abu Zayd b. Amr <br/>
said, ‘Give us back those who are alive and those who are dead I dis- </p>
<p>979 regard.’ The apostle said that Abu Zayd was right and told 'All to ride <br/>
with them. 'All objected that Zayd would not obey him, whereupon the <br/>
apostle told him to take his sword and gave it to him. 'All then said that <br/>
he had no beast to ride, so they (T. the apostle) mounted him on a beast <br/>
belonging to Tha'laba b. 'Amr called al-Mikhal and they went off, when <br/>
lo a messenger from Zayd b. Haritha came on a camel ol Abu \ abr called <br/>
al-Shamir. They made him dismount and he asked 'All how he stood. He <br/>
said that they knew their property and they took it. They went on and <br/>
fell in with the army in Fayfa’ul-Fahlatayn and took their property wdiich <br/>
they held even to the smallest pad from a woman’s saddle. When they had <br/>
finished their task Abu Ji'al said: </p>
<p>There’s many a woman who scolds unkindly, </p>
<p>Who but for us would be feeding her captor’s fire <br/>
Pushed about with her two daughters among the captives <br/>
With no hope of an easy release. </p>
<p>Had she been entrusted to 'Os and Aus <br/>
Circumstances w r ould have prevented her release. </p>
<p>Had she seen our camels in Misr </p>
<p>She would have dreaded a repetition of the journey. </p>
<p>We came to the waters of Yathrib in anger <br/>
(After four nights, search for water is painful) </p>
<p>With every hardened warrior like a wolf <br/>
Dour on the saddle of his swift camel. </p>
<p>May every force 1 in Yathrib be a ransom </p>
<p>For Abu Sulayman when they meet breast to breast </p>
<p>The day you see the experienced warrior humbled, </p>
<p>His head turning as he flees away (904). </p>
<p>Zayd b. Haritha also raided al-Taraf in the region of Nakhl on the road <br/>
to Iraq. </p>
<p>ZAYD B. HARITHA’S RAID ON B. FAZARA AND THE <br/>
DEATH OF UMM QIRFA </p>
<p>Zayd also raided Wadi’l-Qura, where he met B. Fazara and some of his </p>
<p>980 companions were killed; he himself was carried wounded from the field. </p>
<p>1 A.Dh. in Bronnle’s text has jibs with the explanation ‘rascal’. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 66&lt;; </p>
<p>Ward b. 'Amr b. Madash, one of B. Sa'd b. Hudhayl, was killed by one of <br/>
B. Badr (whose name was Sa'd b. Hudhaym— 1 T. and I.H.). When Zayd <br/>
came he swore that he would use no ablution 1 until he raided B. Fazara; <br/>
and when he recovered from his wounds the apostle sent him against them <br/>
with a force. He fought (T. he met) them in Wadi’l-Qura and killed <br/>
some of them. Qays b. al-Musahhar al-Ya'muri killed Mas'ada b. Hakama <br/>
b. Malik b. Hudhayfa b. Badr, and Umm Qirfa Fatima d. Rabi'a b. Badr <br/>
was taken prisoner. She was a very old woman, wife of Malik. Her <br/>
daughter and 'Abdullah b. Mas'ada were also taken. Zayd ordered Qays <br/>
b. al-Musahhar to kill Umm Qirfa and he killed her cruelly (T. by putting <br/>
a rope to her two legs and to two camels and driving them until they rent <br/>
her in two). Then they brought Umm Qirfa’s daughter and Mas'ada’s <br/>
son to the apostle. The daughter of Umm Qirfa belonged to Salama b. <br/>
'Amr b. al-Akwa' who had taken her. She held a position of honour <br/>
among her people, and the Arabs used to say, ‘Had you been more power¬ <br/>
ful than Umm Qirfa you could have done no more.’ Salama asked the <br/>
apostle to let him have her and he gave her to him and he presented her <br/>
to his uncle Hazn b. Abu Wahb and she bare him 'Abdu’l-Rahman b. <br/>
Hazn. </p>
<p>Qays b. al-Musahhar said about the k-illing of Mas'ada: </p>
<p>I tried as his mother’s son would to get revenge for Ward. </p>
<p>As long as I live I will avenge Ward. </p>
<p>When I saw him I attacked him on my steed, </p>
<p>That doughty warrior of the family of Badr. </p>
<p>I impaled him on my lance of Qa'dabI make <br/>
Which seemed to flash like a fire in an open space. </p>
<p>'ABDULLAH B. RAWAHA’S RAID TO KILL AL-YUSAYR </p>
<p>B. rizAm </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. Rawaha raided Khaybar twice; on one occasion he killed <br/>
al-Yusayr b. Rizam (905). Now al-Yusayr (T. the Jew) was in Khaybar <br/>
collecting Ghatafan to attack the apostle. The latter sent 'Abdullah b. 981 <br/>
Rawaha with a number of his companions, among whom were ‘Abdullah <br/>
b. Unays, an ally of B. Salima. When they came to him they spoke to <br/>
him (T. and made him promises) and treated him well, saving that if he <br/>
would come to the apostle he would give him an appointment and honour <br/>
him. They kept on at him until he went with them with a number of <br/>
Jews. 'Abdullah b. Unays mounted him on his beast (T. and he rode <br/>
behind him) until when he was in al-Qarqara, about six miles from <br/>
Khaybar, al-Yusayr changed his mind about going to the apostle. 'Abdullah </p>
<p>1 i.e. abstain from sexual intercourse. The Semites, like other ancient peoples, tabooed <br/>
intercourse during war. Cf. 1 Sam. 21. 5, 6 and Robertson Smith, Religion of thv Semite^ </p>
<p>454 et passim . </p>
<p>666 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>perceived his intention as he was preparing to draw his sword, so he <br/>
rushed at him and struck him with his sword cutting off his leg. AI- <br/>
Yusayr hit him with a stick of shauhat wood which he had in his hand and <br/>
wounded his head (T. and God killed Yusayr). All the apostle’s com¬ <br/>
panions fell upon their Jewish companions and killed them except one <br/>
man who escaped on his feet (T. his beast). When 'Abdullah b. Unays <br/>
came to the apostle he spat on his wound and it did not suppurate or <br/>
cause him pain. </p>
<p>On the second occasion 'Abdullah b. 'Atlk raided Khaybar and killed <br/>
Rafi' b. Abu’l-Huqayq. </p>
<p>‘ABDULLAH B. UNAYS’S RAID TO KILL KHALID B. </p>
<p>SUFYAN B. NUBAYH </p>
<p>The apostle sent him against Khalid, who was in Nakhla or 'Urana <br/>
collecting men to attack the apostle, and he killed him. </p>
<p>Muhammad b. Ja'far b. al-Zubayr told me that 'Abdullah b. Unays <br/>
said: The apostle called me and said that he had heard that Ibn Sufyan <br/>
b. Nubayh al-Hudhall was collecting a force to attack him, and that he <br/>
was in Nakhla or 'Urana and that I was to go and kill him. I asked him <br/>
to describe him so that I might know him, and he said, ‘If you see him he <br/>
will remind you of Satan. A sure sign is that when you see him you will <br/>
feel a shudder.’ I went out girding on my sword until I came on him with <br/>
a number of women in a how'dah seeking a halting-place for them. It <br/>
was the time for afternoon prayer, and when I saw' him I felt a shuddering <br/>
as the apostle had said. I advanced towards him fearing that something </p>
<p>982 would prevent my praying, so I prayed as I walked towards him bowing <br/>
my head. When I came to him he asked w r ho I was and I answ’ered, ‘An <br/>
Arab who has heard of you and your gathering a force against this fellow <br/>
and has come to you.’ He said, ‘Yes, I am doing so.’ I walked a short <br/>
distance with him and when my chance came I struck him with my sw'ord <br/>
and killed him, and went off leaving his women bending over him. When <br/>
I came to the apostle he saw me and said, ‘The aim is accomplished.’ <br/>
I said, ‘I have killed him, O Apostle,’ and he said, ‘You are right.’ </p>
<p>Then he took me into his house and gave me a stick telling me to keep <br/>
it by me. When I w r ent out with it the people asked me what I was doing <br/>
with a stick. I told them that the apostle had given it to me and told me to <br/>
keep it, and they said, ‘Why don’t you go back to the apostle and ask him <br/>
why?’ So I did so, and he said, ‘It is a sign between you and me on the <br/>
resurrection day. There are few men who will be carrying sticks then.’ <br/>
So 'Abdullah b. Unays fastened it to his sword and it remained with him <br/>
until his death, wdien he ordered that it should be put in his winding <br/>
sheet and it w r as buried with him (906). </p>
<p>983 To return to the expeditions: The raid of Zayd b. Haritha and Ja'far <br/>
b. Abu Talib and 'Abdullah b. Rawaha to Mu’ta in Syria in which all </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 667 </p>
<p>were killed; and the raid of Ka'b b. 'Umayr al-Ghifarl to Dhatu Atlah in <br/>
Syria in which he and all his companions w r ere killed; and the raid of <br/>
'Uyayna b. Hisn on B. al-'Anbar of B. Tamim. </p>
<p>THE RAID OF ‘UYAYNA B. HISN ON B. AL-'ANBAR OF B. </p>
<p>TAMIM </p>
<p>The apostle sent him to raid them, and he killed some and captured others. <br/>
'Asim b. 'Umar b. Qatada told me that 'A’isha said to the apostle that she <br/>
must free a slave of the sons of Ismail, and he said, ‘The captives of B. <br/>
al- Anbar are coming now. We will give you one whom you can set free.’ <br/>
When they were brought to the apostle a deputation from B. Tamim <br/>
rode with them until they reached the apostle. Among them were Rabi'a <br/>
b. Rufay'; Sahara b. 'Amr; al-Qa'qa' b. Ma'bad; Wardan b. Muhriz; <br/>
Qays b. Asim; Malik b. 'Amr; al-Aqra' b. Habis; and Firas b. Habis. <br/>
They spoke to the apostle on their behalf and he liberated some and <br/>
accepted ransom for others. </p>
<p>Among the B. al-'Anbar who were killed that day were 'Abdullah and <br/>
two brothers of his, sons of Wahb; Shaddad b. Firas; and Hanzala b. <br/>
Darim. Among the women who were captured were Asma’ d. Malik; <br/>
Ka’s d. Arly; Najwa d. Nahd; Jumay'a d. Qays; and 'Amra d. Matar. <br/>
Salma d. 'Attab said about that day: </p>
<p>'Adiy b. Jundab had a serious fall <br/>
From which it w^as hard to rise. </p>
<p>Enemies surrounded them on every side </p>
<p>And their glory and prosperity disappeared (907). </p>
<p>GHALIB B. ABDULLAH’S RAID ON THE LAND OF <br/>
B. MURRA </p>
<p>The raid of Ghalib b. 'Abdullah al-Kalbl, the Kalb of Layth, was on the <br/>
country of B. Murra in which he slew Mirdas b. Nahik, an ally of theirs <br/>
from al-Hurqa of Juhayna. Usama b. Zayd and a man of the Ansar killed <br/>
him (908). Usama b. Zayd said: ‘When I and a man of the Ansar overtook <br/>
him and attacked him wdth our weapons he pronounced the shahada, <br/>
but we did not stay our hands and killed him. When we came to the apostle <br/>
we told him what had happened and he said, “Who will absolve you, <br/>
Usama, from ignoring the confession of faith ?’’ I told him that the man had <br/>
pronounced the words merely to escape death; but he repeated his ques¬ <br/>
tion and continued to do so until I wished that I had not been a Muslim <br/>
heretofore and had only become one that day and that I had not killed the <br/>
man, I asked him to forgive me and promised that I would never kill a <br/>
man who pronounced the shahada. He said, “You will say it after me, 1 <br/>
Usama?” and I said that I would.’ </p>
<p>1 i.e. after the prophet’s death. </p>
<p>668 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>'AMR B. AL-'AS RAIDS DHATU’L-SALASIL </p>
<p>The raid of 'Amr on Dhatu’l-Salasil in the country of (T. Bali and the <br/>
raid on) B. 'Udhra. The apostle sent him to convoke the Arabs to war on <br/>
Syria. The mother of al-'As b. Wa’il was a woman of Bali, so the apostle <br/>
sent him to them to claim their help. When 'Amr came to water in the <br/>
985 country of Judham called al-Salsal (T. Salasil), from which the raid took <br/>
its name, he took alarm and sent to the apostle for reinforcements. The <br/>
apostle sent him Abu 'Ubayda b. al-Jarrah with the first Muhajirs among <br/>
whom were Abu Bakr and 'Umar. He told Abu 'Ubayda when he sent him <br/>
not to quarrel. Now when he reached 'Amr the latter said, ‘You have <br/>
come only to reinforce me.’ ‘No,’ said Abu 'Ubayda, ‘but I have my sphere <br/>
of command and you have yours’; for he was a man of easy gentle disposi¬ <br/>
tion on whom the affairs of this world sat lightly. So when 'Amr insisted <br/>
that he had come to reinforce him he said, ‘The apostle told us not to <br/>
quarrel, and though you disobey me I will obey you,’ to which he replied, <br/>
‘I am your superior officer and you are here only to reinforce me.’ ‘Have <br/>
it your own way,’ said he, and 'Amr took the lead in the prayers. </p>
<p>An informant who had it from Raff' b. Abu Raff' al-Ta’iy who was <br/>
Raff' b. 'Umayra told me that the latter said: I was a Christian called <br/>
Sarjis, the surest and best guide in the sandy desert. During the pagan <br/>
period I used to bury water which I had put in ostrich shells in various <br/>
places in the desert and then raid men’s camels. When I had got them into <br/>
the sand I was safely in possession of them and none dare follow me thither. <br/>
Then I would go to the places where I had concealed the water and drink <br/>
it. When I became a Muslim I went on the raid on which the apostle <br/>
sent 'Amr b. al-'As to Dhatu’l-Salasil, and I made up my mind to choose <br/>
a companion, and selected Abu Bakr with whom I rode. He wore a <br/>
Fadak cloak and whenever we halted he spread it out, and put it on when <br/>
we rode. Then he fastened it on him with a packing-needle. That was <br/>
the reason why the people of Najd when they apostatized said, ‘Are we to <br/>
accept as ruler the man with the cloak?’ When we approached Medina <br/>
986 on our return I told Abu Bakr that I had joined him so that God might <br/>
profit me by him, and I asked for his advice and instruction. He told me <br/>
that he would have given this even if I had not asked, and told me to pro¬ <br/>
claim the unity of God and not to associate anything with Him; to perform <br/>
prayer; to pay the poor-tax; to fast in Ramadan; to go on pilgrimage; <br/>
to wash after impurity; and never to assume authority over tw r o Muslims. </p>
<p>I told him that I hoped that I should never associate anyone with God; <br/>
that I would never abandon prayer if God so willed; that if I had the means <br/>
I would always pay the poor-tax; that I would never neglect Ramadan; <br/>
that I would go on pilgrimage if I were able; and w’ould w r ash after impu¬ <br/>
rity; but as to leadership I observed that only those w r ho exercised it were <br/>
held in honour with the apostle and the people, so why should he exclude <br/>
me from it? He answered, ‘You asked me for the best advice that I could </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 669 </p>
<p>give you, and I will tell you. God sent Muhammad with this religion and <br/>
he strove for it until men accepted it voluntarily or by force. Once they had <br/>
entered it they were God’s proteges and neighbours under His protection. <br/>
Beware that you do not betray God’s trust in regard to His neighbours so <br/>
that He pursue you relentlessly on behalf of His protege. For if one of you <br/>
were wronged in this w r ay his muscles would sw r ell with anger if the sheep <br/>
or camels of his protege had been seized, and God is more angry on behalf <br/>
of those under His protection.’ Thereupon w'e parted. </p>
<p>When the apostle died and Abu Bakr was set over men I went to him <br/>
and reminded him that he had forbidden me to assume authority over <br/>
two Muslims. He said that he still forbade me to do so, and when I asked <br/>
him what had induced him to assume authority over every one he said that <br/>
he had no alternative; he was afraid that Muhammad’s community would <br/>
split up. </p>
<p>Yazid b. Abu Habib told me that he was informed on the authority of <br/>
'Auf b. Malik al-Ashja'i that he said: I was in the raid on which the apostle <br/>
sent 'Amr b. al-'As to Dhatu’l-Salasil, in company with Abu Bakr and <br/>
'Umar. I passed by some people who were butchering a camel they had <br/>
slaughtered. They could not dismember it, while I w T as a skilled butcher; 987 <br/>
so I asked them if they would give me a share if I divided it between them, <br/>
and when they agreed I took a couple of knives and cut it up on the spot. </p>
<p>I took my share and carried it to my companions and w r e cooked and ate it. </p>
<p>Abu Bakr and 'Umar asked me where I had got the meat, and when I told <br/>
them they said that I had done wrong in giving it to them to eat, and they <br/>
got up and forced themselves to exgurgitate what they had swallowed. <br/>
When the army returned from that expedition I was the first to come to the <br/>
apostle as he was at prayer in his house. When I saluted him he asked if <br/>
I were 'Auf b. Malik the butcher of that camel, and he would say nothing <br/>
more. </p>
<p>THE RAID OF IBN ABU HADRAD ON THE VALLEY OF <br/>
I DAM AND THE KILLING OF 'AMIR B. AL-ADBAT <br/>
AL-ASHJA'I </p>
<p>Yazid b. 'Abdullah b. Qusayt from al-Qa'qa' b. 'Abdullah b. Abu Hadrad <br/>
from his father said: The apostle sent us to Idam with a number of Muslims <br/>
among whom were Abu Qatada al-Harith b. Rib'iy; and Muhallim b. <br/>
Jaththama b. Qays. We set forth until when w r e were in the valley of <br/>
Idam (T. this was before the conquest of Mecca) 'Amir b. al-Adbat <br/>
al-Ashja'i passed by us on a camel of his with a meagre supply of provi¬ <br/>
sions and a skin of laban. As he passed us he saluted us as a Muslim and <br/>
we held off from him. But Muhallim b. Jaththama attacked and killed <br/>
him on account of a quarrel they had had, and took his camel and provi¬ <br/>
sions. When we came to the apostle and told him the news there came down <br/>
concerning us: ‘O you who believe, wiien you go forth in the w r ay of God </p>
<p>670 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>act circumspectly and do not say to one who salutes you, “You are no <br/>
believer,’' coveting the gain of this world,’ &amp;c. (909). 1 </p>
<p>988 Muhammad b. Ja'far b. al-Zubayr told me that he heard Ziyad b. <br/>
Dumayra b. Sa'd al-Sulaml relating from 'Unva b. al-Zubayr from his <br/>
father from his grandfather who were both present at Hunayn with the <br/>
apostle: The apostle prayed the noon prayer with us, then he sought the <br/>
shelter of a tree and sat beneath it in Hunayn. Al-Aqra' b. Habis and <br/>
'Uyayna b. Hisn b. Hudhayfa b. Badr w 7 ent up to him quarrelling about <br/>
'Amir b. al-Adbat al-Ashja'i, 'Uyayna, who was at that time chief of <br/>
Ghatafan, demanding vengeance for the blood of 'Amir and al-Aqra' <br/>
protecting Muhallim b. Jaththama because of his position among Khindif. <br/>
The quarrel w*ent on a long time in the apostle’s presence and as we <br/>
listened we heard 'Uyayna say, ‘O apostle, I w r on’t let him off until I <br/>
make his women taste the burning grief he made my women taste’; <br/>
wdiile the apostle said, ‘No, but you will accept fifty camels as blood- <br/>
money on this journey and fifty on our return.’ He went on refusing the <br/>
offer when up got a man of B. Layth called Mukaythir, a short compact <br/>
fellow 7 {910), and said, ‘O apostle, the only thing to which I can compare <br/>
this man w 7 ho has been slain in the beginning of Islam is sheep who come <br/>
with their leaders shot and the ones behind run away. Let the law of blood <br/>
stand today and accept bloodwit later.’ The apostle lifted up his hand <br/>
and said, ‘No, you must take fifty camels as blood-money on this expedi¬ <br/>
tion and fifty more when we return,’ and they accepted them. Then they <br/>
said, ‘Where is this fellow of yours that the apostle may ask God’s pardon <br/>
for him?’ Thereupon a tall thin man wearing a garment which he had taken <br/>
to fight 2 in got up and sat in front of the apostle. He admitted that he w 7 as <br/>
Muhallim b. Jaththama and the apostle said three times, ‘O God, pardon <br/>
not Muhallim b. Jaththama.’ He got up wiping away his tears with the <br/>
end of his garment. As for us, we still hoped that the apostle asked for the <br/>
divine forgiveness for him, but wdiat we saw him do was what has just <br/>
been said. </p>
<p>One whom I have no reason to suspect told me from al-Hasan al-Basri <br/>
989 that the apostle said when he sat before him, ‘You gave him security in <br/>
God and then you killed him!’ Then he said the words which have been <br/>
quoted, and by God Muhallim died within a week, and the earth I swear <br/>
rejected him. They buried him again, but the earth rejected him, and yet a <br/>
third time the same thing happened. Worn out, his people made for two <br/>
heights (forming a narrow gap) and laid him out between them and then <br/>
rolled rocks on him until they had covered him. When the apostle heard <br/>
about this he said, ‘The earth has covered worse than he, but God wants <br/>
to give you a warning of what you must not do by what He has shown you.’ </p>
<p>Salim Abu’l-Nadr told us that he was informed that 'Uyayna b. Hisn <br/>
and Qays were addressed privately by al-Aqra' thus: ‘You men of Qays, <br/>
you have opposed the apostle about a man slain when he wanted to make </p>
<p>1 Sura 4. 96. 2 Or, perhap^, ‘die in’. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 671 </p>
<p>peace between people. Are you sure that the apostle will not curse you so <br/>
that God will curse you with his curse, or that he will not be angry with <br/>
you so that God will also be angry with you? I swear that unless you <br/>
submit him to the apostle and let him do with him as he pleases I will <br/>
bring fifty men of the B. Tamim who will all call God to wdtness that your <br/>
friend who was slain was an unbeliever who never prayed at all and thus <br/>
cause his blood to be disregarded.’ 1 When they heard that they agreed to <br/>
take the bloodwit (911). </p>
<p>THE RAID OF IBN ABU HADRAD AL-ASLAMl ON </p>
<p>AL-GHABA TO KILL RIFA'a B. QAYS AL-JUSHAMI </p>
<p>One whom I have no reason to suspect told me from Ibn IJadrad as <br/>
follow r s: I had married a woman of my tribe and promised her tw ; o hundred <br/>
dirhams as a dowry. I came to the apostle and asked him to help me in the <br/>
matter and when I told him the amount that I had promised he said, <br/>
‘Good gracious, if you could get dirhams from the bottom of a valley you <br/>
could not have offered more! I haven’t the money to help you.’ I waited <br/>
for some days when a man of B. Jusham b. Mu'awiya called Rifa'a b. 990 <br/>
Qays or Qays b. Rifa'a came with a numerous clan of B. Jusham and <br/>
encamped with them in al-Ghaba intending to gather Qays to fight the <br/>
apostle, he being a man of high reputation among Jusham. The apostle <br/>
summoned me and tw'O other Muslims and told us to go to this man (T. <br/>
and bring him to him or) bring new r s of him, and sent us an old thin she- <br/>
camel. One of us mounted her, but she was so w r eak that she could not <br/>
get up until men pushed her up from behind, and even then she hardly <br/>
managed to do so. Then he said, ‘Make the best of her and ride her in <br/>
turn.’ </p>
<p>We set forth taking our arrow's and sw r ords until we arrived near the <br/>
settlement in the evening as the sun was setting. I hid at one end and <br/>
ordered my companions to'hide at the other end of the camp and told <br/>
them that when they heard me cry 'Allah akbar’ as I ran to the camp they <br/>
were to do the same and run with me. There w r e were waiting to take the <br/>
enemy by surprise or to get something from them until much of the night <br/>
had passed. Now they had a shepherd who had gone out with the animals <br/>
and was so late in returning that they became alarmed on his behal/. Their <br/>
chief this Rifa'a b. Qays got up and took his sword and hung it round his <br/>
neck, saying that he would go on the track of the shepherd, for some harm <br/>
must have befallen him; whereupon some of his company begged him not <br/>
to go alone for they ■would protect him, but he insisted on going alone. </p>
<p>As he went he passed by me, and when he came in range I shot him in the <br/>
heart with an arrow, and he died without uttering a w'ord. I leapt upon <br/>
him and cut off his head and ran in the direction of the camp shouting <br/>
‘Allah akbar’ and my two companions did likewise, and by God, shouting </p>
<p>1 i.e. not to be wiped out by the blood of his slayer or tribesmen or to be paid for. </p>
<p>672 The Life of Muhammad- </p>
<p>out to one another they all fled at once with their wives and children and <br/>
such of their property as they could lay hands on easily. We drove off <br/>
a large number of camels and sheep and brought them to the apostle and </p>
<p>991 I took Rifa'a’s head to the apostle, who gave me thirteen of the camels to <br/>
hejp me with the woman’s dowry, and I consummated my marriage. </p>
<p>'abdu’l-rahman b. 'auf’s raid on dumatu’l-jandal </p>
<p>One whom I have no reason to suspect told me from 'Ata’ b. Abu Ribah <br/>
that he said that he heard a man of Basra ask 'Abdullah b. 'Umar b. <br/>
al-Khattab about wearing the turban flying loosely behind one. He said <br/>
that he would give them information on the point. 'I was’, he said, ‘the <br/>
tenth of ten of the apostle’s companions in his mosque, namely Abu <br/>
Bakr, ‘Umar, 'Uthman, 'All, 'Abdu’l-Rahman b. 'Auf, Ibn Mas'ud, <br/>
Mu'adh b. Jabal, Hudhayfa b. al-Yaman, Abu Sa'id al-Khudri, and myself. <br/>
Suddenly one of the Ansar came and saluted the apostle and sat down and <br/>
asked the apostle who was the most excellent of the believers. “The best <br/>
in character,” he replied. “And who is the wisest?” “The one who most <br/>
often remembers death and makes the best preparation for it before it <br/>
comes to him. Such men are the wise.” The man remained silent, and <br/>
the apostle said to us, “O Muhajirs, there are five things which may befall <br/>
you and I pray God that you may escape them: moral decay never openly <br/>
shows itself among a people but they suffer from pestilence and disease <br/>
such as their fathers have never known; they do not use light weights and <br/>
measures but they are smitten by famine and the injustice of rulers; they <br/>
do not hold back the poor-tax from their herds but rain is withheld, for but <br/>
for the beasts there would be no rain sent; they do not break the covenant <br/>
with God and His apostle but an enemy is given power over them and takes <br/>
much of their possessions; and their imams do not give judgement about <br/>
God’s book and behave arrogantly 1 in regard to what God has sent down <br/>
but God brings upon them the calamity they have engendered.” </p>
<p>‘Then he ordered Wbdu’l-Rahman b. 'Auf to make his preparations for </p>
<p>992 the expedition. In the morning he wore a black turban of cotton. The <br/>
apostle told him to approach and unwound it and then rewound it leaving <br/>
four fingers or so loose behind him, saying, “Turban yourself thus, Ibn <br/>
'Auf, for thus it is better and neater .” 2 Then he ordered Bilal to give him <br/>
the standard and he did so. Then he gave praise to God and prayed for <br/>
himself. He then said, “Take it, Ibn 'Auf; fight everyone in the way of <br/>
God and kill those who disbelieve in God. Do not be deceitful with the <br/>
spoil; do not be treacherous, nor mutilate, nor kill children. This is <br/>
God’s ordinance and the practice 3 of his prophet among you.” Thereupon <br/>
'Abdu’l-Rahman took the standard’ (912). </p>

<p>abu'ubayda b. al-jarrah’s raid to the coast </p>
<p>Ubada b. al-W ahd b. 'Ubada b. al-Samit from his father from his grand¬ <br/>
father Ubada b. al-Samit told me: The apostle sent a force to the coast <br/>
commanded by Abu 'Ubayda and furnished them with a supply of dates. </p>
<p>He “ e S an t0 ration them until the day came when he had to count them, <br/>
and finally he could give each man but one date a day. One day he divided <br/>
them among us and a man lacked even a date and we felt the loss of them <br/>
that day. When we were exhausted by hunger God brought us a whale <br/>
from the sea, and we fell upon its flesh and fat and stayed by it for twenty <br/>
nights until we grew' fat and recovered our strength. Our leader took one <br/>
of its ribs and set it in the way; then he sent for our largest camel and <br/>
mounted our largest man upon it; he sat on it and came out from under it <br/>
without lowering his head. When we came to the apostle we gave him the <br/>
news and asked him what he thought about our having eaten the whale. </p>
<p>He said, It was food which God provided for you’ (913). </p>
<p>(Ibn Hamid told us from Salama b. ai-Fadl from Muhammad b. T- 1437 <br/>
Ishaq from Ja far b. al-Fadl b. al-Hasan b. 'Amr b. Umayya al-Damri <br/>
from his father from his grandfather 'Amr b. Umayya that the last-named T- 1438 <br/>
said: After the killing of Khubayb and his companions the apostle sent an <br/>
Ansan with me telling us to go and kill Abu Sufyan, so we set out. My <br/>
companion had no camel and his leg was injured, so I carried him on my <br/>
beast as far as the valley of Ya jaj where we tethered our beast in the <br/>
corner of a pass and rested there. I suggested to my companion that we <br/>
should go to Abu Sufyan’s house and I would try to kill him while he <br/>
kept watch. If there was a commotion or he feared danger he should take <br/>
to his camel and go to Medina and tell the prophet the news; he could leave <br/>
me because I knew the country well and was fleet-footed. When we <br/>
entered Mecca I had a small dagger like an eagle’s feather which I held in <br/>
readiness: if anyone laid hold of me I could kill him with it. My com¬ <br/>
panion asked that we might begin by going round the Ka'ba seven times <br/>
and pray a couple of rak'as. I told him that I knew more about the Meccans <br/>
than he: in the evening their courts are sprinkled with water and they sit <br/>
there, and I am more easily recognizable than a piebald horse. However, <br/>
he kept on at me until we did as he wanted, and as we came out of the <br/>
Ka ba we passed by one of their groups and a man recognized me and <br/>
caffed out at the top of his voice, ‘This is 'Amr b. Umayya!’ Thereupon <br/>
the Meccans rushed at us, saying, ‘By God, 'Amr has come for no good </p>
<p>He has never brought anything but evil,’ for 'Amr was a violent unruly <br/>
fellow in heathen days. </p>
<p>They got up to pursue us and I told my companion to escape, for the T. 1439 <br/>
very thing I feared had happened, and as to Abu Sufyan there was no <br/>
means of getting at him. So we made off with all speed and climbed the <br/>
mountain and went into a cave where we spent the night, having successfully <br/>
eluded them so that they returned to Mecca. When we entered the cave </p>
<p>B 4080 X x </p>
<p>674 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>I put some rocks at the entrance as a screen and told my companion to <br/>
keep quiet until the pursuit should die down, for they would search for us <br/>
that night and the following day until the evening. While we were in the <br/>
cave up came 'Uthman b. Malik b. 'Ubaydullah al-Tayml cutting grass <br/>
for a horse of his. He kept coming nearer until he was at the very entrance <br/>
of the cave. I told my friend who he was and that he would give us away <br/>
to the Meccans, and I went out and stabbed him under the breast with the <br/>
dagger. He shrieked so loud that the Meccans heard him and came to¬ <br/>
wards him. I went back to the cave and told-my friend to stay w'here he was. <br/>
The Meccans hastened in the direction of the sound and found him at the <br/>
last gasp. They asked him who had stabbed him and he told them that <br/>
it was I, and died. They did not get to know where w'e were and said, <br/>
‘By God, we knew 'Amr was up to no good.’ They were so occupied with <br/>
the dead man whom they carried off that they could not look for us, and <br/>
we stayed a couple of days in the cave until the pursuit died down. Then <br/>
we went to al-Tan'im, and lo, Khubayb’s cross. 1 My friend asked if we <br/>
T- 1440 should take him down from the cross, for there he was. I told him to leave <br/>
the matter to me and to get away from me for guards w r ere posted round <br/>
it. If he was afraid of anything he must go to his camel and tell the apostle <br/>
what had happened. I ran up to Khubayb’s cross, freed him from it, and <br/>
carried him on my back. Hardly had I taken forty steps when they <br/>
became aware of me and I threw him down and I cannot forget the thud <br/>
when he dropped. They ran after me and I took the way to al-Safra’ <br/>
and when they wearied of the pursuit they went back and my friend rode <br/>
to the prophet and told him our new^s. I continued on foot until I looked <br/>
down on the valley of Dajnan. I went into a cave there taking my bow and <br/>
arrows, and while I was there in came a one-eyed man of B. al-Dil driving <br/>
a sheep of his. When he asked who I was I told him that I w r as one of B. <br/>
Bakr. He said that he was also, adding of B. al-Dil clan. Then he hay <br/>
down beside me and lifting up his voice began to sing: </p>
<p>I won’t be a Muslim as long as I live, </p>
<p>Nor heed to their religion give. </p>
<p>I said (to myself), ‘You will soon know!’ and as soon as the badu was <br/>
asleep and snoring I got up and killed him in a more horrible way than <br/>
any man has been killed. I put the end of my bow in his sound eye, then <br/>
I bore down on it until I forced it out at the back of his neck. Then I <br/>
came out like a beast of prey and took the highroad like an eagle hastening <br/>
until I came out at a village which, (said the narrator), he described; then <br/>
to Rakiiba and al-Naqi' where suddenly there appeared tw r o Meccans whom <br/>
T- 1441 Quraysh had sent to spy on the apostle. I recognized them and called on <br/>
them to surrender, and when they refused I shot one and killed him, and <br/>
the other surrendered. I bound him and took him to the apostle. </p>

<p>You obey a stranger who is none of yours, </p>
<p>One not of Murad or Madhhij. 1 </p>
<p>Do you expect good from him after the killing of your chiefs <br/>
Like a hungry man waiting for a cook’s broth ? </p>
<p>Is there no man of pride who would attack him by surprise <br/>
And cut off the hopes of those who expect aught from him ? </p>
<p>996 Hassan b. Thabit answered her: </p>
<p>Banu Wa’il and B. Waqif and Khatma <br/>
Are inferior to B. al-Khazraj. </p>
<p>When she called for folly woe to her in her weeping, </p>
<p>For death is coming. </p>
<p>She stirred up a man of glorious origin, </p>
<p>Noble in his going out and his coming in. </p>
<p>Before midnight he dyed her in her blood <br/>
And incurred no guilt thereby. </p>
<p>When the apostle heard what she hacl said he said, ‘Who will rid me of <br/>
Marwan’s daughter?’ 'Umayr b. 'Adly al-Khatmi who w r as with him heard <br/>
him, and that very night he went to her house and killed her. In the morn¬ <br/>
ing he came to the apostle and told him what he had done and he said, <br/>
‘You have helped God and His apostle, O 'Umayr!* When he asked if he <br/>
would have to bear any evil consequences the apostle said, ‘Two goats <br/>
won’t butt their heads about her,’ so 'Umayr went back to his people. </p>
<p>Now there was a great commotion among B. Khatma that day about the <br/>
affair of Bint Marwan. She had five sons, and when 'Umayr went to them <br/>
from the apostle he said, ‘I have killed Bint Marwan, O sons of Khatma. <br/>
Withstand me if you can; don’t keep me waiting.’ 2 That was the first <br/>
day that Islam became powerful among B. Khatma; before that those who <br/>
were Muslims concealed the fact. The first of them to accept Islam was <br/>
'Umayr b. 'Adiy who was called ‘the Reader’, and 'Abdullah b. Aus and <br/>
Khuzayma b. Thabit. The day after Bint Marwan was killed the men of B. <br/>
Khatma became Muslims because they saw the pow'er of Islam. </p>
<p>THE CAPTURE OF THUMAMA B. ATHAL AL-HANAFl </p>
<p>I heard on the authority of Abu Sa'Id al-Maqburi from Abu Hurayra <br/>
that the latter said: The apostle’s cavalry went out and captured a man of </p>
<p>997 B. Hanifa not knowing who he was until they brought him to the apostle <br/>
w r ho told them that he w r as Thumama b. Athal al-Hanafl and that they <br/>
must treat him honourably in his captivity. The apostle went back to his <br/>
house and told them to send what food they had to him, and ordered that <br/>
his milch-camel should be taken to him night and morning; but this <br/>
failed to satisfy Thumama. The apostle went to him and urged him to </p>
<p>1 Two tribes of YamanI origin. </p>
<p>2 Cf. Sura 11, 58. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 677 </p>
<p>acce P t Islam. He said, ‘Enough, Muhammad; if you kill me you kill one <br/>
ose blood must be paid for; if you want a ransom, ask what you like ’ <br/>
Matters remained thus so long as God willed and then the apostle said </p>

<p>THE EXPEDITION OF 'ALQAMA B. MUJAZZIZ 99 g </p>
<p>When Waqqas b Mujazziz al-Mudlijl was killed on the day of Dhu <br/>
Oarad, Alqama b Mujazziz asked the apostle to send him on the track <br/>
of the people so that he might take vengeance on them. 'Abdu’l-'Aziz b <br/>
Muhammad from Muhammad b. 'Amr b. 'Alqama from 'Umar b. al- <br/>
yakam b Thauban from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said: The apostle seat <br/>
Alqama b. Mujazziz, I being with the force, and when we were on the way <br/>
e summoned a part of the force and appointed 'Abdullah b. Hudhafa <br/>
a -Sahmi their leader. He was one of the apostle’s companions—a facetious <br/>
fellow, and when they were on the way he kindled a fire an’d said to the <br/>
men. Have I not claim on your obedience so that if I order you to do <br/>
something you must do it?’ and when they agreed he said, ‘Then by <br/>
virtue of my claim on your obedience I order you to leap into this fire • <br/>
borne ot them began to gird up their loins so that he thought that they <br/>
would leap into the fire, and then he said, ‘Sit down, I was only laughing <br/>
at you! When the apostle was told of this after they had returned he said </p>

<p>Muhammad b. Talha said that ‘Alqama and his companions returned <br/>

<p>KURZ B. JABIR’S EXPEDITION TO KILL THE BAJILIS <br/>
WHO HAD KILLED YASAR </p>
<p>A traditionist told me from one who had told him from Muhammad b. </p>
<ul>
<li>f ™ m Uthman b. 'Abdu’l-Rahman that in the raid of Muharib <br/>
and B. I ha laba the apostle had captured a slave called Yasar, and he put <br/>
him in charge of his milch-camels to shepherd them in the neighbourhood <br/>
of al-Jamma . Some men of Qays of Kubba of Bajlla came to the apostle 999 <br/>
suffering from an epidemic and enlarged spleens, and the apostle told them <br/>
that if they went to the milch-camels and drank their milk and urine they </li>
</ul>
<p>6 7 8 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>would recover, so off they went. When they recovered their health and their <br/>
bellies contracted to their normal size they fell upon the apostle s shepherd <br/>
Yasar and killed him and stuck thorns in his eyes and drove away his <br/>
camels. The apostle sent Kurz b. Jabir in pursuit and he overtook them <br/>
and brought them to the apostle as he returned from the raid of Dhu <br/>
Qarad. He cut off their hands and feet and gouged out their eyes. </p>
<p>'ALl’S RAID ON THE YAMAN <br/>
‘Ali raided the Yaman twice (916). </p>
<p>USAMA B. ZAYD’S MISSION TO PALESTINE </p>
<p>The apostle sent Usama to Syria and commanded him to take the cavalry <br/>
into the borders of the Balqa’ and al-Darhm in the land of Palestine. So <br/>
the men got ready and all the first emigrants went with Usama (917)* </p>
<p>THE BEGINNING OF THE APOSTLE’S ILLNESS </p>
<p>While matters were thus the apostle began to suffer from the illness by <br/>
which God took him to what honour and compassion He intended <br/>
for him shortly before the end of Safar or in the beginning of Rablu’l- <br/>
000 awwal. It began, so I have been told, when he went to Baqi'u’l-Gharqad <br/>
in the middle of the night and prayed for the dead. Then he returned to <br/>
his family and in the morning his sufferings began. </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. 'Umar from 'Ubayd b, Jubayr, a freedman of al-Hakam <br/>
b. Abu’I-'As, from 'Abdullah b. 'Amr b. al-'As from Abu Muwayhiba, a <br/>
freedman of the apostle, said: In the middle of the night the apostle sent <br/>
for me and told me that he was ordered to pray for the dead in this cemetery <br/>
and that I was to go with him. I went; and when he stood among them he <br/>
said, ‘Peace upon you, O people of the graves! Happy are you that you are <br/>
so much better off than men here. Dissensions have come like waves of <br/>
darkness one after the other, the last being worse than the first.’ Then he <br/>
turned to me and said, ‘ I have been given the choice between the keys of the <br/>
treasuries of this world and long life here followed by Paradise, and meeting <br/>
my Lord and Paradise (at once).’ I urged him to choose the former, but <br/>
he said that he had chosen the latter. Then he prayed for the dead there <br/>
and went away. Then it was that the illness through which God took him <br/>
began. </p>
<p>Ya'qub b. 'Utba from Muhammad b. Muslim al-Zuhri from Ubay- <br/>
dullah b. 'Abdullah b. 'Utba b. Mas'ud from 'A’isha, the prophet’s wife, <br/>
said: The apostle returned from the cemetery to find me suffering from <br/>
a severe headache and I was saying, ‘O my head! He said, Nay, A isha, <br/>
O my head!’ Then he said, ‘Would it distress you if you were to die before <br/>
me so that I might wrap you in your shroud and pray over you and bury </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad ftyg </p>
<p>you?’ I said, ‘Methinks I see you if you had done that returning to my <br/>
house and spending a bridal night therein with one of your wives.’ The <br/>
apostle smiled and then his pain overcame him as he was going the round <br/>
of his wives, until he was overpowered in the house of Maymuna. He <br/>
called his wives and asked their permission to be nursed in my house <br/>
and they agreed (918). </p>
<p>THE APOSTLE’S ILLNESS IN THE HOUSE OF 'A’lSHA. 1 I005 </p>
<p>The apostle went out walking between two men of his family, one of <br/>
whom was al-Fadl b. al-'Abbas. His head was bound in a cloth and his <br/>
feet were dragging as he came to my house. 'Ubaydullah told this tradi¬ <br/>
tion to 'Abdullah b. al-'Abbas who told him that the other man was 'Ali <br/>
(T. but that 'A’isha could not bring herself to speak well of him though <br/>
she was able to do so). 5 </p>
<p>Then the apostle’s illness worsened and he suffered much pain He IO ° 6 <br/>
said, ‘Pour seven skins of water from different wells over me so that I may <br/>
go out to the men and instruct them.’ We made him sit down in a tub <br/>
belonging to Hafsa d. 'Umar and we poured water over him until he cried <br/>
‘Enough, enough!’ </p>
<p>Al-Zuhri said that Ayyub b. Bashir told him that the apostle went out <br/>
with his head bound up and sat in the pulpit. The first thing he uttered <br/>
was a prayer over the men of Uhud asking God’s forgiveness for them and <br/>
praying for them a long time; then he said, ‘God has given one of his <br/>
servants the choice between this world and that which is with God and he <br/>
has chosen the latter.’ Abu Bakr perceived that he meant himself and he <br/>
wept, saying, ‘Nay, we and our children will be your ransom.’ He replied, <br/>
Gently, Abu Bakr,’ adding, ‘See to these doors that open on to the mosque <br/>
and shut them except one from Abu Bakr’s house, for I know no one who is <br/>
a better friend to me than he’ (919). </p>
<p>Abdu 1 -Rahman b. 'Abdullah told me from one of the family of Sa'Td <br/>
b, al-Mu alia that the apostle said in his speech that day, ‘If I were able <br/>
to choose a friend on earth I would choose Abu Bakr, but comradeship <br/>
and brotherhood in the faith remain until God unites us in His presence.’ </p>
<p>Muhammad b. Ja far b. al-Zubayr told me from 'Urwa b. al-Zubavr and <br/>
other learned men that the apostle found the people tardy in joining the <br/>
expedition of Usama b. Zayd while he was suffering, so he went out with <br/>
his head bound up until he sat in the pulpit. Now people had criticized the <br/>
leadership of Usama, saying, ‘He has put a young man in command of the <br/>
best of the emigrants and the helpers.’ After praising God as is His due he <br/>
sai , O men, dispatch Usama’s force, for though you criticize his leadership <br/>
as you criticized the leadership of his father before him, he is just as worthy <br/>
of the command as his father was.’ Then he came down and the people 1007 <br/>
hurried on with their preparations. The apostle’s pain became severe and <br/>
LI. 3 tradition from 'A’isha continues. </p>
<p>68o </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Usama and his army went out as far as al-Jurf, about a stage from Medina, <br/>
and encamped there and men gathered to him. When the apostle became <br/>
seriously ill Usama and his men stayed there to see what God would <br/>
decide about the apostle. </p>
<p>Zuhrl said that 'Abdullah b. Ka'b b. Malik told him that the apostle said <br/>
on the day that he asked God’s forgiveness for the men of Uhud, ‘O <br/>
Muhajirs, behave kindly to the Ansar, for other men increase but they in the <br/>
nature of things cannot grow more numerous. They were my constant <br/>
comfort and support. So treat their good men well and forgive those of them <br/>
who are remiss.’ Then he came down and entered his house and his pain <br/>
increased until he was exhausted. Then some of his wives gathered to <br/>
him, Umm Salama and Maymuna and some of the wives of the Muslims, <br/>
among them Asma’d. 'Umays while his uncle 'Abbas was with him, and <br/>
they agreed to force him to take medicine. 'Abbas said, ‘Let me force <br/>
him,’ but they did it. When he recovered he asked who had treated him <br/>
thus. When they told him it was his uncle he said, ‘This is a medicine <br/>
which women have brought from that country,’ and he pointed in the <br/>
direction of Abyssinia. When he asked why they had done that his uncle <br/>
said, ‘We were afraid that you would get pleurisy;’ he replied, ‘That is a <br/>
disease which God would not afflict me with. Let no one stop in the house <br/>
until they have been forced to take this medicine, except my uncle.’ </p>
<p>1008 Maymuna was forced to take it although she was fasting because of the <br/>
apostle’s oath, as a punishment for what they had done to him. </p>
<p>T* 1809 (T. Muhammad b. Ja'far b. al-Zubayr told me from 'Urwa b. al- </p>
<p>Zubayr that 'A’isha told him that when they said that they were afraid <br/>
that he would get pleurisy he said, ‘That is something which comes from <br/>
the devil, and God would not let it have power over me.’) </p>
<p>Sa'Id b. 'Ubayd b. al-Sabbaq from Muhammad b. Usama from his <br/>
father told me that when the apostle’s illness became severe he and the men <br/>
came down to Medina and he went in to the apostle who was unable to <br/>
speak. He began to lift his hand towards heaven and then bring it down <br/>
upon him, from which he knew that he was blessing him. </p>
<p>Ibn Shihab al-Zuhrl told me from 'Ubayd b. 'Abdullah b. 'Utba from <br/>
'A’isha that she used to hear the apostle say, ‘God never takes a prophet <br/>
to Himself without giving him the choice.’ When he was at the point of <br/>
death the last word I heard the apostle saying was, ‘Nay, rather the Exalted <br/>
Companion of paradise.’ 1 I said (to myself), Then by God he is not choosing <br/>
us! And I knew that that was what he used to tell us, namely that a prophet <br/>
does not die without being given the choice. </p>
<p>Al-Zuhrl said, Hamza b. 'Abdullah b. 'Umar told me that 'A’isha said: <br/>
‘When the prophet became seriously ill he ordered the people to tell <br/>
Abu Bakr to superintend the prayers. 'A’isha told him that Abu Bakr was <br/>
a delicate man with a weak voice who wept much when he read the Quran. <br/>
He repeated his order nevertheless, and I repeated my objection. He said, </p>
<p>1 Cf. Sura 4. 71. </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 6g r </p>
<p>\ou are like Joseph s companions; tell him to preside at prayers.” My <br/>
only reason for saying what I did was that I wanted Abu Bakr to be spared <br/>
this task, because I knew that people would never like a man who occupied <br/>
the apostle s place, and would blame him for everv misfortune that occurred <br/>
and I wanted Abu Bakr to be spared this.’ </p>
<p>Ibn Shihab said, 'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr b. 'Abdu’l-RahmSn b. al- 1009 <br/>
■ anth b. Hisham told me from his father from 'Abdullah b. Zama'a b. <br/>
al Aswad b. al-Muttalib b. Asad that when the apostle was seriously ill <br/>
and I with a number of Muslims was with him Bilal called him to prayer, <br/>
and he told us to order someone to preside at prayers. So I went out and <br/>
there was 'Umar with the people, but Abu Bakr was not there. I told </p>
<p>f AV, n f^u get 1 Up and lead the P rayers &gt; so he did so, and when he shouted <br/>
Allah Akbar the apostle heard his voice, for he had a powerful voice, and he </p>
<p>W 1 her f Ab ° Bakr Was ’ sayin S twice over &gt; &lt;God and the Muslims <br/>
lorbid that. So I was sent to Abu Bakr and he came after 'Umar had <br/>
finished that prayer and presided. 'Umar asked me what on earth I had <br/>
done, saying, When you told me to take the prayers I thought that the <br/>
apostle had given you orders to that effect; but for that I would not haw <br/>
done so.’ I replied that he had not ordered me to do so, but when I could <br/>
not see Abu Bakr I thought that he was most worthy of those present to <br/>
preside at prayers. </p>
<p>Al-Zuhri said that Anas b. Malik told him that on the Monday (T. <br/>
the day) on which God took His apostle he went out to the people as they <br/>
were praying the morning prayer. The curtain was lifted and the door <br/>
opened and out came the apostle and stood at 'A’isha’s door. The Muslims <br/>
were almost seduced from their prayers for joy at seeing him, and he <br/>
motioned to them (T. with his hand) that they should continue their <br/>
prayers. The apostle smiled with joy when he marked their mien in prayer, <br/>
and I never saw him with a nobler expression than he had that day. Then <br/>
he went back and the people went away thinking that the apostle had <br/>
recovered from his illness. Abu Bakr returned to his wife in al-Sunh. </p>
<p>Muhammad b. Ibrahim b. al-Harith told me from aLQasim b. Muham- 1010 <br/>
mad that when the apostle heard 'Umar saving Allah Akbar in the prayer </p>
<p>he asked where Abu Bakr was. ‘God and the Muslims forbid this.’ Had </p>
<p>it not been for what 'Umar said when he died, the Muslims would not <br/>
have doubted that the apostle had appointed Abu Bakr his successor; but <br/>
he said when he died, ‘If I appoint a successor, one better than I did so; <br/>
and if I leave them (to elect my successor) one better than I did so.’ So <br/>
the people knew that the apostle had not appointed a successor and 'Umar <br/>
was not suspected of hostility towards Abu Bakr. 1 </p>
<p>Abu Bakr b. 'Abdullah b. Abu Mulayka told me that when the Mondav <br/>
came the apostle went out to morning prayer with his head wrapped up <br/>
while Abu Bakr was leading the prayers. When the apostle went out the <br/>
peop e s attention \a ered, and Abu Bakr knew that the people would not <br/>
1 Abu Bakr appointed 'Umar to succeed him; the prophet made no appointment. </p>
<p>682 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>behave thus unless the apostle had come, so he withdrew from his place; <br/>
but the apostle pushed him in the back, saying, ‘Lead the men in prayer,’ <br/>
and the apostle sat at his side praying in a sitting posture on the right of <br/>
Abu Bakr. When he had ended prayer he turned to the men and spoke <br/>
to them with a loud voice which could be heard outside the mosque: <br/>
‘0 men, the fire is kindled, and rebellions come like the darkness of the <br/>
night. By God, you can lay nothing to my charge. I allow only what the <br/>
Quran allows and forbid only what the Quran forbids.’ </p>
<p>When he had ended these words Abu Bakr said to him: ‘O prophet <br/>
of God, I see that this morning you enjoy the favour and goodness of God <br/>
as we desire; today is the day of Bint Kharija. May I go to her?’ The <br/>
apostle agreed and went indoors and Abu Bakr went to his wife in al-Sunh. </p>
<p>Al-Zuhrl said, and 'Abdullah b. Ka'b b. Malik from 'Abdullah b. 'Abbas <br/>
told me: That day 'All went out from the apostle and the men asked him <br/>
ioi i how the apostle was and he replied that thanks be to God he had recovered. <br/>
'Abbas took him by the hand and said, “All, three nights hence you will be <br/>
a slave, I swear by God that I recognized death in the apostle’s face as I <br/>
used to recognize it in the faces of the sons of 'Abdu’l-Muttalib. So let <br/>
us go to the apostle; if authority is to be with us, we shall know it, and if it <br/>
is to be with others w r e will request him to enjoin the people to treat us <br/>
well.’ 'All answered: ‘By God, I will not. If it is withheld from us none <br/>
after him wall give it to us.’ The apostle died with the heat of noon that day. </p>
<p>Ya'qub b. 'Utba from al-Zuhrl from 'Urw r a from 'A’isha said: The <br/>
apostle came back to me from the mosque that day and lay in my bosom. <br/>
A man of Abu Bakr’s family came in to me with a toothpick in his hand <br/>
and the apostle looked at it in such a w r ay that I knew he wanted it, and <br/>
w'hen I asked him if he w anted me to give it him he said Yes; so I took it <br/>
and chewed it for him to soften it and gave it to him. He rubbed his teeth <br/>
w r ith it more energetically than I had ever seen him rub before; then he <br/>
laid it down. I found him heavy in my bosom and as I looked into his <br/>
face, lo his eyes were fixed and he was saying, ‘Nay, the most Exalted Com¬ <br/>
panion is of paradise.’ I said, ‘You were given the choice and you have <br/>
chosen, by Him Who sent you with the truth!’ And so the apostle was taken. </p>
<p>Yahya b. 'Abbad b. 'Abdullah b. al-Zubayr from his father told me <br/>
that he heard 'A’isha say: The apostle died in my bosom during my turn: </p>
<p>I had WTonged none in regard to him. It was due to my ignorance and <br/>
extreme youth that the apostle died in my arms. Then I laid his head on a <br/>
pillow r and got up beating my breast and slapping my face along with the <br/>
1012 other women. </p>
<p>Al-Zuhrl said, and Sa'ld b. al-Musayyib from Abu Hurayra told me: <br/>
When the apostle w r as dead 'Umar got up and said: ‘Some of the dis¬ <br/>
affected will allege that the apostle is dead, but by God he is not dead: he <br/>
has gone to his Lord as Moses b. 'Imran went and was hidden from his <br/>
people for forty days, returning to them after it was said that he had died. <br/>
By God, the apostle will return as Moses returned and w r ill cut off the </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 683 </p>
<p>hands and feet of men who allege that the apostle is dead.’ When Abu <br/>
Bakr heard what was happening he came to the door of the mosque as </p>
<p>Elmar was speaking to the people. He paid no attention but went in to <br/>
'A’isha’s house to the apostle, who was lying covered by a mantle of <br/>
YamanI cloth. He went and uncovered his face and kissed him, saying, </p>
<p>‘You are dearer than my father and mother. You have tasted the death <br/>
which God had decreed: a second death will never overtake you.’ Then he <br/>
replaced the mantle on the apostle’s face and went out. 'Umar was still <br/>
speaking and he said, ‘Gently, 'Umar, be quiet.’ But 'Umar refused and <br/>
went on talking, and when Abu Bakr saw that he w T ould not be silent he <br/>
went forward to the people who, when they heard his words, came to him <br/>
and left 'Umar. Giving thanks and praise to God he said: ‘O men, if <br/>
anyone worships Muhammad, Muhammad is dead: if anyone worships <br/>
God, God is alive, immortal.’ Then he recited this verse: ‘Muhammad is <br/>
nothing but an apostle. Apostles have passed away before him. Can it <br/>
be that if he were to die or be killed you would turn back on your heels? </p>
<p>He who turns back does no harm to God and God will reward the grateful.’ 1 <br/>
By God, it was as though the people did not know that this verse (T. <br/>
concerning the apostle) had come down until Abu Bakr recited it that day. </p>
<p>The people took it from him and it was (constantly) in their mouths. 1013 <br/>
Umar said, ‘By God, when I heard Abu Bakr recite these words I was <br/>
dumbfounded so that my legs would not bear me and I fell to the ground <br/>
knowing that the apostle was indeed dead.’ </p>
<p>THE MEETING IN THE HALL OF B. SATDA </p>
<p>When the apostle was taken this clan of the Ansar gathered round Sa'd <br/>
b. 'Ubada in the hall of B. Saida, and 'All and al-Zubayr b. al-'Awwam <br/>
and Talha b. 'Ubaydullah separated themselves in Fatima’s house while <br/>
the rest of the Muhajirin gathered round Abu Bakr accompanied by <br/>
EJsayd b. Hudayr with the B. 'Abdu’l-Ashhal. Then someone came to <br/>
Abu Bakr and 'Umar telling them that this clan of the Ansar had gathered <br/>
round Sa d in the hall of B. Sa'ida. ‘If you want to have command of the <br/>
people, then take it before their action becomes serious.’ Now the apostle <br/>
was still in his house, the burial arrangements not having been completed, <br/>
and his family had locked the door of the house. 'Elmar said, ‘I said to <br/>
Abu Bakr, Let us go to these our brothers of the Ansar to see what they <br/>
are doing.’ </p>
<p>In connexion with these events 'Abdullah b. 'Abu Bakr told me from <br/>
Ibn Shihab al-Zuhrl from 'Ubaydullah b. 'Abdullah b. 'Utba b. Mas'ud <br/>
from 'Abdullah b. 'Abbas who said, I was waiting for 'Abdu’l-Rahman <br/>
b. Auf in his station in Mina while he was with 'Umar in the last pil¬ <br/>
grimage W'hich C T mar performed. When he returned he found me waiting, <br/>
for I was teaching him to read the Quran. 'Abdu’l -Rahman said to me: </p>
<p>1 Sura 3. 138. </p>
<p>684 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>‘I wish you could have seen a man who came to the commander of the <br/>
faithful and said, “O commander of the faithful, would you like a man <br/>
1014 who said, By God, if 'Umar were dead I would hail So-and-so. Fealty <br/>
given to Abu Bakr was a hasty mistake and was ratified.” * 'Umar was <br/>
angry and said, ‘God willing, I shall get up among the men tonight and <br/>
warn them against those who want to usurp power over them.’ X said, <br/>
‘Don’t do it, commander of the faithful, for the festival brings together <br/>
the riff-raff and the lowest of the people; they are the ones who will be in <br/>
T. 1820 the majority in your proximity (T. your assembly) when you stand among <br/>
the people. And I am afraid lest you should get up and say something <br/>
which they will repeat everywhere, not understanding what you say or <br/>
interpreting it aright; so wait until you come to Medina, for it is the home <br/>
of the surma and you can confer privately with the lawyers and the nobles <br/>
of the people. (T. you will come to the home of the hijra and the surma and <br/>
you can confer privately with the apostle’s companions both muhdjirin and <br/>
ansar .) 1 You can say what you will and the lawyers (T. they) will under¬ <br/>
stand what you say and interpret it properly.’ 'Umar replied, ‘By God, if <br/>
He will I will do so as soon as I get to Medina.’ </p>
<p>We came to Medina at the end of Dhu’l-Hijja and on the Friday I <br/>
returned quickly when the sun had set and found Sa'Id b. Zayd b. 'Amr <br/>
b. Nufayl sitting by the support of the pulpit and I sat opposite him knee <br/>
to knee. Immediately 'Umar came out and when I saw him coming I said <br/>
to Sa'Id, ‘He will say something tonight on this pulpit which he has never <br/>
said since he was made caliph.’ Sa'Id was annoyed and asked, ‘What do <br/>
you suppose that he is going to say that he has never said before?’ 'Umar <br/>
sat in the pulpit, and when the muezzins were silent he praised God as <br/>
was fitting and said: ‘I am about to say to you today something which God <br/>
has walled that I should say and I do not know whether perhaps it is my <br/>
last utterance. He who understands and heeds it let him take it with him <br/>
whithersoever he goes; and as for him who fears that he wall not heed it, <br/>
he may not deny that I said it. God sent Muhammad and sent dow r n the <br/>
scripture to him. Part of what he sent down was the passage on stoning; <br/>
we read it, we w r ere taught it, and we heeded it. The apostl stoned <br/>
(adulterers) and w'e stoned them after him. I fear that in time to come men <br/>
will say that they find no mention of stoning in God’s book and thereby <br/>
1015 go astray by neglecting an ordinance which God has sent down. Verily <br/>
stoning in the book of God is a penalty laid on married men and women <br/>
who commit adultery, if proof stands or pregnancy is clear or confession <br/>
is made. Then we read in what we read from God’s book: “Do not desire <br/>
to have ancestors other than your own for it is infidelity so to do.” ’ 2 </p>
<p>1 The difference between the two reports of what f.I. said is interesting. Ziyad makes the <br/>
lawyers and the sharifs the ultimate authority while has nothing to say about them and <br/>
regards the prophet’s companions as the real authorities. If the tradition is genuine r JYs <br/>
version must be authentic because there can hardly have been lawyers in 'Umar’s day. <br/>
However, it is possible that at that tim e fiqh did not bear its later meaning. </p>
<ul>
<li>This citation, which on the face of it has nothing to do with adultery, shows that the </li>
</ul>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 685 </p>
<p>Did not the apostle say, ‘Do not praise me extravagantly as Jesus son <br/>
of Mary was praised and say The servant and the apostle of God?’ I <br/>
have heard that someone said, ‘If 'Umar were dead I would hail So-and-so.’ <br/>
Don’t let a man deceive himself by saying that the acceptance of Abu <br/>
Bakr was an unpremeditated affair 1 which was ratified. Admittedly it was <br/>
that, but God averted the evil of it. There is none among you to whom <br/>
people would devote themselves as they did to Abu Bakr. He who accepts <br/>
a man as ruler without consulting the Muslims, such acceptance has no <br/>
validity for either of them: they are in danger of being killed. What <br/>
happened was that when God took away His apostle the Ansar opposed us <br/>
and gathered with their chiefs in the hall of B. Saida; and 'All and <br/>
al-Zubayr and their companions withdrew from us; while the Muhajirin <br/>
gathered to Abu Bakr. </p>
<p>I told Abu Bakr that we should go to our brothers the Ansar, so we went <br/>
off to go to them when two honest fellows met us and told us of the con¬ <br/>
clusion the people had come to. They asked us where we were going, and <br/>
when we told them they said that there was no need for us to approach <br/>
them and we must make our own decision. I said, ‘By God, we will go <br/>
to them,’ and we found them in the hall of B. Sa'ida. In the middle of <br/>
them was a man wrapped up. In answer to my inquiries they said that he <br/>
was Sa d b. Ubada and that he was ill. When we sat down their speaker <br/>
pronounced the shahada and praised God as was fitting and then con¬ <br/>
tinued: ‘We are God’s Helpers and the squadron of Islam. You, O <br/>
Muhajirin, are a family of ours and a company of your people have come <br/>
to settle.’ ('Umar) said, ‘And lo, they were trying to cut us off from our <br/>
origin and wrest authority from us.’ 2 When he had finished I wanted to </p>
<p>aya of which it is the beginning was well known in I.I.’s time, it continues: 'If an adult <br/>
man or woman commit adultery stone them without exception as a punishment from God <br/>
God is mighty and wise.' See Ndldeke-Schwally, Gesch. d. Qorans, i. 248, where the <br/>
authorities are given. If it was part of the Quran it is difficult to see where it stood originally <br/>
Muslim authorities suggest Sura 33, but the rhyme forbids this; and Sura 24, but there the <br/>
punishment is scourging. Most commentators hold that the verse is one of those that was <br/>
afterwards abrogated, while others say that it was accidentally lost owing to a domestic <br/>
animal eating the part of the page on which the revelation was written. Cf. Zamakhshari <br/>
on Sura 33, and others. This tradition which is carried back to 'A’isha is condemned as the <br/>
invention of sectarians. There is a real problem which can hardly be satisfactorily solved ■ <br/>
on the one hand, the Quran teaches that adulterers must be scourged; on the other hand, </p>
<p>this exceeding early tradition—much older than the later canonical collections of hadith _ </p>
<p>that they must be stoned is evidently the authority which lies behind the penalty prescribed <br/>
by Muslim lawbooks to this day. See the authorities quoted op, cit., p. 251 </p>
<p>Since the words shaykha and albatta occur nowhere in the Quran and’since the first part <br/>
of )he verse appears in a slightly different form as a saying of Muhammad in Muslim’s <br/>
ifahih (lman 27), the probability is that it never formed part of the Quran. However if the <br/>
traditional form of ‘Umar’s speech as given by I.I. (and by q on another authority) ls <br/>
authentic, it remains to be explained why 'Umar, who was a most truthful man, should have <br/>
stated publicly in the strongest possible terms that the verse was to be read in the Quran </p>
<p>falta. I have translated this ‘hasty mistake’ on p. 684. The exact meaning is some- <br/>
what elusive. </p>
<p>The crucial word gala indicating that 'Umar was the speaker is missing from W T <br/>
1822 makes the passage perfectly clear. ‘He said When I saw that they wanted to cut us off <br/>
from (yakJitaztlu) our origin and wrest authority from us and I had prepared,’ &amp;c. The </p>
<p>686 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>ioib speak, for I had prepared a speech in my mind which pleased me much. <br/>
I wanted to produce it before Abu Bakr and I was trying to soften a certain <br/>
asperity of his; but Abu Bakr said, ‘Gently, ‘Umar!’ I did not like to <br/>
anger him and so he spoke. He was a man with more knowledge and dignity <br/>
than I, and by God he did not omit a single word which I had thought of <br/>
and he uttered it in his inimitable way better than I could have done. </p>
<p>He said: ‘All the good that you have said about yourselves is deserved. <br/>
But the Arabs will recognize authority only in this clan of Quraysh, they <br/>
being the best of the Arabs in blood and country. I offer you one of these <br/>
two men: accept which you please.' Thus saying he took hold of my hand <br/>
and that of Abu 'Ubayda b. al-Jarrah who was sitting between us. Nothing <br/>
he said displeased me more than that. By God, I would rather have come <br/>
forward and have had my head struck off—if that were no sin—than rule <br/>
over a people of whom Abu Bakr was one. </p>
<p>One of the Ansar said: ‘I am the rubbing post and the fruitful propped-up <br/>
palm. 1 Let us have one ruler and you another, O Quraysh.’ Altercation <br/>
waxed hotter and voices were raised until when a complete breach was to <br/>
be feared I said, ‘Stretch out your hand, Abu Bakr.' He did so and I <br/>
paid him homage; the Muhajirin followed and then the Ansar. (In doing <br/>
so) we jumped on Sa‘d b. 'Ubada and someone said that we had killed him. <br/>
I said, ‘God kill him.' </p>
<p>Al-Zuhrl said that 'Urwa b. al-Zubayr told him that one of the two <br/>
men whom they met on the way to the hall was 'Uwaym b. Sa'ida and the <br/>
other was Man b. *Adiy, brother of B. al-'Ajlan. Concerning 'Uwaym we <br/>
have heard that when the apostle was asked who were those of whom God <br/>
said ‘In it are men who love to purify themselves and God loves those who <br/>
purify themselves’, 2 the apostle said that the best man of them was Uw'aym <br/>
b. Sa'ida. As to Man, we have heard that when mdn wept over the apostle’s <br/>
death and said that they wished that they had died before him because <br/>
they feared that they would split up into factions, he said that he did not <br/>
1017 want to die before him so that he could bear witness to his truth when he <br/>
was dead as he had done when he was alive. Man was killed on the day <br/>
of al-Yamama as a martyr in the caliphate of Abu Bakr, the day of <br/>
Musaylima the arch-liar. </p>
<p>Al-Zuhrl told me on the authority of Anas b. Malik: On the morrow of <br/>
Abu Bakr’s acceptance in the hall he sat in the pulpit and ‘Umar got up <br/>
and spoke before him, and after praising God as was meet he said, ‘O <br/>
T- 1828 men, yesterday I said something (T. based on my own opinion and) <br/>
which I do not find in God’s book nor was it something which the apostle <br/>
entrusted to me; but I thought that the apostle would order our affairs <br/>
(T. until) he was the last of us (alive). God has left His book with you, </p>
<p>passage is of great importance in that it shows how the Emigrants were then the dominating <br/>
party and henceforth the Ansar would have to take a subordinate place. </p>
<p>1 i.e. a man who can cure people’s ills and is held in high esteem because of his great ex¬ <br/>
perience. 2 Sura 9. 109, </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad 687 </p>
<p>that by which He guided His apostle, and if you hold fast to that God will <br/>
guide you as He guided him. God has placed your affairs in the hands of <br/>
the best one among you, the companion of the apostle, “the second of the <br/>
two when they were in the cave”, 1 so arise and swear fealty to him.’ <br/>
Thereupon the people swore fealty to Abu Bakr as a body after the pledge <br/>
in the hall. </p>
<p>Abu Bakr said after praising God: ‘I have been given authority over you <br/>
but I am not the best of you. If I do well, help me, and if I do ill, then put <br/>
me right. Truth consists in loyalty and falsehood in treachery. The weak <br/>
among you shall be strong in my eyes until I secure his right if God will; <br/>
and the strong among you shall be weak in my eyes until I wrest the right <br/>
from him. If a people refrain from fighting in the way of God, God will <br/>
smite them with disgrace. Wickedness is never widespread in a people <br/>
but God brings calamity upon them all. Obey me as long as I obey God <br/>
and His apostle, and if I disobey them you owe me no obedience. Arise <br/>
to prayer. God have mercy on you.’ </p>
<p>Husayn b. ‘Abdullah told me from Tkrima from Ibn ‘Abbas who said: <br/>
‘When 'Umar was caliph I was walking with him while he was intent on 1018 <br/>
business of his. We were alone and he had a whip in his Hand, and as he <br/>
talked to himself he swished the side of his legs with his whip. As he <br/>
turned to me he asked me if I knew what induced him to speak as he did <br/>
when the apostle died. I said that only he could know that, and he w^ent on; </p>
<p>“It was because I used to read ‘thus we have made you a middle people <br/>
that you may be witnesses against men and that the apostle may be a <br/>
witness against you,’ 2 and by God I thought that the apostle would remain <br/>
among his people until he could witness against them as to the last things <br/>
they did. That was what induced me to say what I did.” ’ </p>
<p>THE BURIAL PREPARATIONS </p>
<p>When fealty had been sworn to Abu Bakr men came to prepare the apostle <br/>
for burial on the Tuesday. ‘Abdullah b. Abu Bakr and Husayn b. 'Abdullah <br/>
and others of our companions told me that 'All and ‘Abbas and his sons <br/>
al-Fadl and Qutham, and Usama b. Zayd, and Shuqran freedman of the <br/>
apostle were those who took charge of the washing of him; and that Aus <br/>
b. KhaulT, one of B. 'Auf b. al-Khazraj, said, ‘I adjure you by God, 'All, and <br/>
by our share in the apostle.’ 3 Aus w'as one of the apostle’s companions who <br/>
had been at Badr. ‘AH gave him permission to enter and he came in and <br/>
sat down and was present at the washing of the apostle. ‘All drew him <br/>
on to his breast and 'Abbas and al-Fadl and Qutham turned him over <br/>
along with him. Usama and Shuqran poured the water over him, while <br/>
'All washed him, having drawn him towards his breast. He still wore his <br/>
shirt with which he rubbed him from the outside without touching the </p>
<p>1 Sura 9. 40. </p>
<p>3 sc. ‘that you will let me take part’ or some such apodosis. </p>
<p>Sura 2. 137. </p>
<p>688 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>1019 apostle’s body with his hand the while he said, ‘Dearer than my father <br/>
and my mother, how sweet you are alive and dead!’ The apostle’s body <br/>
did not present the appearance of an ordinary corpse. </p>
<p>Yahya b. 'Abbad b. 'Abdullah b. al-Zubayr from his father 'Abbad <br/>
from 'A’isha: When they wanted to wash the apostle dispute arose. They <br/>
did not know whether they were to strip him of his clothes as they stripped <br/>
their dead or to wash him with his clothes on. As they disputed God cast <br/>
a deep sleep upon them so that every man’s chin was sunk on his chest. <br/>
Then a voice came from the direction of the house, none knowing who it <br/>
was: ‘Wash the apostle with his clothes on.’ So they got up and went <br/>
to the apostle and washed him with his shirt on, pouring water on the <br/>
T- 1831 shirt, and rubbing him with the shirt between him and them (T. 'A’isha <br/>
used to say, ‘Had I known at the beginning of my affair what I knew at the <br/>
end of it none but his wives would have washed him’). </p>
<p>Ja'far b. Muhammad b. 'All b. al-Husayn from his father from his <br/>
grandfather 'All b. al-Husayn, and al-Zuhrl from 'All b. al-Husayn, said <br/>
that when the apostle had been washed he was wrapped in three garments, <br/>
two of Suhar make 1 and a striped mantle wrapped the one over the other. </p>
<p>Husayn b. 'Abdullah told me from Tkrima from Ibn 'Abbas: Now <br/>
Abu 'Ubayda b. al-Jarrah used to open the ground as the Meccans dig, <br/>
and Abu Talha Zayd b. Sahl used to dig graves for the Medinans and to <br/>
make a niche in them and when they wanted to bury the apostle al-'Abbas <br/>
called two men and told one to go to Abu ‘Ubayda and the other to Abu <br/>
Talha saying, ‘O God, choose for (T. thy) the apostle.’ The one sent to <br/>
Abu Talha found his man and brought him and he dug the grave with the <br/>
niche for the apostle. 2 </p>
<p>When the preparations for burial had been completed on the Tuesday <br/>
he was laid upon his bed in his house. The Muslims had disputed over the <br/>
place of burial. Some were in favour of burying him in his mosque, while <br/>
others wanted to bury him with his companions. Abu Bakr said, ‘I heard <br/>
the apostle say, “No prophet dies but he is buried where he died”’; so </p>
<p>1020 the bed on which he died was taken up and they made a grave beneath it. <br/>
Then the people came to visit the apostle praying over him by companies: <br/>
first came the men, then the women, then the children (T. then the <br/>
slaves). No man acted as imam in the prayers over the apostle. The <br/>
apostle was buried in the middle of the night of the Wednesday. </p>
<p>'Abdullah b. Abu Bakr told me from his wife Fatima d. (T. Muhammad <br/>
b.) 'Umara from 'Amra d. 'Abdu’l-Rahman b. Sa'd b. Zurara that 'A’isha <br/>
said: We knew nothing about the burial of the apostle until we heard the <br/>
sound of the pickaxes in the middle of the Wednesday night. Ibn Ishaq <br/>
said: Fatima told me this tradition. </p>
<p>Those who descended into the grave were 'All and al-Fadl and Qutham </p>
<p>1 There are two towns of this name, one in the Yaman and the other in al-Yamama in B. <br/>
Tamim territory. </p>
<p>2 All Muslim graves contain this niche or recess. </p>
<p>Ihe Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>the sons of Abbas, and Shuqran. Aus implored 'All in the name of God <br/>
and his share in the apostle to let him descend, and he let him go with the <br/>
others When the apostle was laid in his grave and the earth was laid over <br/>
him Shuqran his freedman took a garment which the apostle used to wear <br/>
and use as a rug and buried (T. cast) it in the grave saying, ‘By God, none <br/>
shall ever wear it after you,’ so it was buried with the apostle. </p>
<p>Al-Mughira b. Shu'ba used to claim that he was the last man to be with <br/>
the apostle. He used to say, ‘I took my ring and let it fall into the grave <br/>
and said, My ring has dropped. But I threw it in purposely that I might <br/>
touch the apostle and be the last man to be with him.’ </p>
<p>My father Ishaq b. Yasar told me from Miqsam, freedman of 'Abdullah <br/>
b. al-Harith b. Naufal, from his freedman ‘Abdullah b. al-Harith; I went <br/>
on the little pilgrimage with 'All in the time of 'Umar or 'Uthman and he 1021 <br/>
visited his sister Umm Hani’ d. Abu Talib. When he had finished his <br/>
pilgrimage (T. I poured out) ablution water was poured out for him and he <br/>
washed. When he had finished some Iraqis came in saying that they had <br/>
come to ask him about a matter on which they would like him to give them <br/>
some information. He said, ‘I suppose that al-Mughlra tells you that he was <br/>
the last person to be with the apostle?’ When they said that that was so, <br/>
he said, ‘He lies. The last man to be with the apostle was Qutham b! <br/>
'Abbas.’ </p>
<p>?ahh b. Kaysan told me from al-Zuhrl from 'Ubaydullah b. 'Abdullah <br/>
b. Ltba that A isha told him: The apostle wore a black cloak when he <br/>
suffered severe pain. Sometimes he w'ould put it over his face, at others he <br/>
would take it off, saying the while, ‘God slay a people w'ho choose the graves <br/>
of their prophets as mosques,’ warning his community against such a <br/>
practice. </p>
<p>On the same authority I was told that the last injunction the apostle <br/>
gave was in his words ‘Let not two religions be left in the Arabian peninsula.’ </p>
<p>(T. The apostle died on the 12th Rabl'u-I-awwal on the very day that he T- 1834 <br/>
came to Medina as an emigrant, having completed exactly twelve years <br/>
m his migration.) When the apostle was dead the Muslims were sore <br/>
stricken. I have heard that A’isha used to say, ‘When the apostle died the <br/>
Arabs apostatized and Christianity and Judaism raised their heads and <br/>
disaffection appeared. The Muslims became as sheep exposed to rain on a <br/>
winter’s night through the loss of their prophet until God united them <br/>
under Abu Bakr’ (920). </p>
<p>Hassan said mourning the apostle: IQ25 </p>
<p>Tell the poor that plenty has left them <br/>
W ith the prophet who departed from them this morning. </p>
<p>Who w r as it who has a saddle and a camel for me, </p>
<p>My family’s sustenance when rain fails ? </p>
<p>Or with whom can we argue without anxiety <br/>
W'hen the tongue runs away with a man ? </p>

<p>690 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>He was the light and the brilliance we followed. </p>
<p>He was sight and hearing second only to God. </p>
<p>The day they laid him in the grave </p>
<p>And cast the earth upon him </p>
<p>Would that God had not left one of us </p>
<p>And neither man nor woman had survived him! </p>
<p>The BanuTNajjar were utterly abased, </p>
<p>But it was a thing decreed by God. </p>
<p>The booty was divided to the exclusion of all the people <br/>
And they scattered it openly and uselessly among themselves. 1 </p>
<p>1026 Hassan also said: </p>
<p>I swear that no man is more careful than I <br/>
In swearing an oath true and without falsehood. </p>
<p>By God, no woman has conceived and given birth </p>
<p>To one like the apostle the prophet and guide of his people; </p>
<p>Nor has God created among his creatures <br/>
One more faithful to his sojourner or his promise <br/>
Than he who was the source of our light, </p>
<p>Blessed in his deeds, just, and upright. </p>
<p>Your wives stripped the tents in mourning <br/>
And did hot strike the pegs behind the curtains. </p>
<p>Like nuns they put on garments of hair <br/>
Certain of misery after happiness. </p>
<p>O best of men, I was as it were in a river </p>
<p>Without which I have become lonely in my thirst (921). </p>

<p>IBN HISHAM’S NOTES </p>
<ol>
<li>What I have just written about the prophet’s genealogy back to Adam <br/>
and about Idris and others I was told by Zivad b. 'Abdullah al-Bakka’I on <br/>
the authority of Muhammad b. Ishaq. </li>
</ol>
<p>Khallad b. Qurra b. Khalid al-SadusI on the authority of Shayban b. <br/>
Zuhayr b. Shaqlq from Qatada b. Di'ama gave a slightly different version <br/>
from Ismail upwards, namely: Asragh-Arghu-Falikh-'Abir and (later) <br/>
Mahla’ll b. Qayin b. Anush. </p>
<p>God willing I shall begin this book with Isma’il son of Ibrahim and men¬ <br/>
tion those of his offspring who were the ancestors of God’s apostle one by one <br/>
with what is known about them, taking no account of Isma’ll’s other children, <br/>
for the sake of brevity, confining myself to the prophet’s biography and <br/>
omitting some of the things which 1.1. has recorded in this book in which <br/>
there is no mention of the apostle and about which the Quran says nothing <br/>
and which are not relevant to anything in this book or an explanation of it or <br/>
evidence for it; poems which he quotes that no authority on poetry whom I <br/>
have met knows of; things which it is disgraceful to discuss; matters which <br/>
would distress certain people; and such reports as al-Bakka’I told me he <br/>
could not accept as trustworthy—all these things I have omitted. But God <br/>
willing I shall give a full account of everything else so far as it is known and <br/>
trustworthy tradition is available. </p>

<p>Some say Midad. Jurhum was the son of Qahtan from whom all the <br/>
people of the Yaman are descended, the son of 'Abir b. Shalikh h. Arfakh- <br/>
shadh b. Sam b. Nuh. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Arabs say Hajar and Ajar, changing the h into a as in the verb <br/>
haraqa and araqa ‘to pour out’. Hajar was an Egyptian. 'Abdullah b. <br/>
Wahb from 'Abdullah b. Lahl'a on the authority of Umar client of Ghufra <br/>
told me that the apostle said: ‘Show piety in dealing with the protected <br/>
peoples, those of the settled lands, the black, the crinkly haired, for they <br/>
have a noble ancestor and marriage ties (with us).’ The said Umar explained <br/>
that by ancestry the prophet referred to the fact that the prophet Isma’il’s <br/>
mother came from them, and the marriage tie was contracted when the apostle <br/>
took one of them as concubine. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I bn Lahia said: Isma’H’s mother Hagar, the mother of the Arabs, 1 came <br/>
from a town in Egypt facing Farama; 2 and Ibrahim’s mother Maria, the <br/>
prophet’s concubine whom the Muqauqis gave him, came from Hafn 3 in <br/>
the province of Angina. </p>
<ol>
<li>All the Arabs are descended from Isma’il and Qahtan. Some of the <br/>
people of the Yaman claim that Qahtan was a son of Isma il and so according <br/>
to them Isma’il is the father of all the Arabs. </li>
</ol>
<p>1 The text (both W, and C.) has ‘came from Umm al-'Arab’, but I have followed the <br/>
reading of W.’s MS. D. Yaq. i, 356, who agrees with W. and C., adds: ‘Others say Umm <br/>
al-'Arik; and it is said that she came from a town called Yaq near Umm Dunavn.’ </p>

<p>Ghassan is the name of the water got from the dam at Marib 2 in the Yaman <br/>
which was drunk by the descendants of Mazin b. al-Asd b. al-Ghauth and <br/>
they were named after it. Others say that Ghassan is the name of water at <br/>
al-Mushallal near al-Juhfa, 3 and those who drink of it and take their name <br/>
from it are the tribes descended from Mazin b. al-Asd b. al-Ghauth b. Nabt <br/>

<p>Ibn His ham's Notes 693 </p>
<p>HOW AMR B. AMIR LEFT THE YAMAN AND THE STORY OF <br/>
THE DAM OF MARIB </p>
<p>The cause of 'Arm’s migration from the Yaman as it was told me by Abu <br/>
Zayd al-An^art is as follows: 'Amr saw a rat burrowing in the dam at <br/>
Marib where they used to hold back the water and then direct it where it was <br/>
most needed. He perceived that the dam could not last and he determined <br/>
to leave the Yaman. He proposed to deceive his people in this wise. He <br/>
ordered his youngest son to get up and hit him in retaliation for his rough <br/>
treatment; and when he did so 'Amr said publicly that he would not go on <br/>
living in a land where the youngest son could slap his father’s face. He offered <br/>
his goods for sale and the principal men of the Yaman took advantage, as <br/>
they thought, of his rage, and bought his property, and he went off with his <br/>
sons and grandchildren. The Azdites said that they would not remain if <br/>
'Amr left the country so they sold their property and went with him. They <br/>
travelled until they came to the land of the 'Akk tribe which they penetrated, <br/>
desiring to find settlements. 'Akk took up arms against them, but the fighting <br/>
w r as indecisive. It was of this that Abbas b, Mirdas composed the verse on <br/>
p. 6. After this they moved on and went their several ways in the lands. <br/>
The family of Jafna b. 'Amr b. 'Amir settled in Syria; Aus and Khazraj in <br/>
Yathrib; Khuza'a in Marr; 1 Azd al-Sarat in Al-Sarat 2 and Azd 'Uman in <br/>
'Uman. </p>
<p>Then God sent a torrent against the dam and destroyed it. Concerning <br/>
this event God revealed to his prophet Muhammad: ‘Saba’ in their dwelling- <br/>
place had a sign: two gardens one to the right and another to the left; (they <br/>
were commanded) Eat from what your Lord has furnished and be grateful <br/>
to Him. It is a goodly land and a forgiving Lord. But they turned away and <br/>
We sent against them the torrent of al-'Arim.’ 3 This latter word means ‘dams’; <br/>
its singular is ' arima according to what Abu 'Ubayda told me. </p>

b. Sharahil b. 'Auf b. Sa'd b. Dubay'a b. Qays b. Tha'laba) wrote the <br/>
following lines: </p>
<p>Herein is a moral for him who looks for it. </p>
<p>The dams (that were breached) destroyed Marib. </p>
<p>(Himyar had built them of marble for them. </p>
<p>When the floods rose high they stood fast. </p>
<p>When their water was sent out in channels </p>
<p>It watered the crops and the vines). </p>
<p>Then they became wanderers unable </p>
<p>To give drink to their tender babes. 4 </p>

Rabfa b. 'Amir b. Sa'sa'a b. Mu'awiya b. Bakr b. Hawazin. But this is a <br/>
long story w'hich I am compelled to cut short for the reasons I have already <br/>
given. 1 </p>
<p>T 909 (Before that a soothsayer Shaft' b. Kulayb al-Sadafl had come to Tubba' <br/>
and lived with him and when he wished to bid him farewell Tubba' asked <br/>
him whether he had anything of importance to communicate, and in the <br/>
customary rhymes of saj ' he told him in reply to the question whether any <br/>
king would fight with Tubba', ‘No, but the king of Ghassan had a son whose <br/>
kingdom would be surpassed by a man of great piety, helped by the Almighty, <br/>
described in the psalms; his people would be favoured by revelation, he <br/>
would dispel darkness by light, Ahmad the prophet. How blessed his people <br/>
when he comes, one of the sons of Lu’ayy of B. Qusayy!’ Tubba' sent for a <br/>
copy of the psalms, examined them, and found the description of the prophet. </p>
<p>Ibn Ishaq gleaned and assembled the following traditions from what <br/>
Sa'Id b. Jubayr told him from I. 'Abbas and some learned Yaman! tradi- <br/>
tionist: A Lakhmid king was in Yaman in the territory of the Tubba's <br/>
of Himyar called Rabfa b. Nasr. Before him there had reigned in the <br/>
Yaman Tubba' I, Zayd b. Sahl. 2 With him came Shamir Yur'ish b. Yasir <br/>
Yun'im b. 'Amr Dhu’l-Adh'ar his cousin and Shamir Yur'ish who raided <br/>
China and built Samarqand and discomfited al-Hlra. 3 He it was who said: </p>
<p>I am Shamir Abu Karib al-YamanI. </p>
<p>I imported horses from Yaman and Syria </p>
<p>That I might send the slaves who rebelled against us </p>
<p>In 'Athm and Yam beyond China. 4 </p>
<p>We rule in their land by a just law </p>

Armenia ordering him to show preference to those who possessed pure <br/>
Arab horses, as against those who owned mixed breeds, when distributing <br/>
spoils. Accordingly he mustered the cavalry and as he passed by 'Amr b. <br/>
Ma'dI Karib’s horse he said: ‘This horse of yours is of mixed breed.’ <br/>
'Amr was furious and said: ‘A mongrel knows a mongrel like himself!’ <br/>
Qays sprang at him and threatened him, whereupon 'Amr recited the <br/>
verses just quoted. </p>

<p>These words occur in one of his rajaz poems. Some commentators say that <br/>
sijjtl is really two Persian words which the Arabs have made into one, <br/>
namely sanj and jill sanj means stone and jill means clay, and so a pebble <br/>
made of stone and clay. 'Asf means leaves (or shoots) of herbage which have <br/>
not been cut; its singular is 'asfa. Abu 'Ubayda told me it is also called <br/>
'usafa and 'asifa. He quoted to me the lines of 'Alqama b. 'Abada, one of </p>
<p>B. Rabi'a b. Malik b. Zayd Manat b. Tamim: </p>
<p>It waters torrents whose herbage droops. </p>
<p>The bed of the stream is raised by the rush of water. </p>
<p>Ibn Hi sham’s Notes 697 </p>
<p>These words occur in one of his odes. The rajaz poet says: </p>
<p>And they were made as blades of corn that have been devoured. </p>
<p>An explanation of the idiom employed here is to be found in w'orks on <br/>
grammar. </p>
<p>The words Ildfu Quraysh mean ‘their assembling the party to go to <br/>
Syria for trade’. They had two expeditions; one in winter and one in summer. <br/>
Abu Zayd al-Ansari told me that the Arabs use the first and fourth forms of <br/>
’alaf in the same sense and he quoted to me the words of Dhu 1 -Rumma: </p>
<p>Of the sand-dwellers are the tawny-backed white-bellied (gazelles) </p>
<p>In whose colouring the rays of the sun become clearly seen. </p>
<p>[This man was Sa'id b. Aus b. Thabit. Cf. ^aq. 4 &gt; P- 2 35 -l <br/>
Matrud b. Ka'b al-Khuza'i said: </p>
<p>Who are generous when the stars fail to bring rain <br/>
And who set out upon their accustomed w^ay. </p>
<p>I shall mention this and other verses of his later on if God will. Ilaf is also <br/>
used of a man who has a thousand camels, cattle, or sheep, or other posses¬ <br/>
sions. In one of his odes al-Kumayt b. Zayd, one of B. Asd b. Khuzayma <br/>
b. Mudrika b. Ilyas b. Mudar b. Nizar b. Ma add, said: </p>
<p>In a year of which the owner of a thousand camels says <br/>
This makes the man who longs for milk walk on foot. </p>
<p>Ildf is also used when a people become a thousand in number. In one of his <br/>
odes al-Kumayt b. Zayd said: </p>
<p>The family of Muzayqiya’ on the morn they met <br/>
The Banu Sa'd b. Dabba were a thousand strong. </p>
<p>Ildf also means the joining of one thing to another so that it adheres and <br/>
sticks to it. It also means to complete the thousand. </p>

<p>Ibn Hisham s Notes 699 </p>
<p>afterwards deposing him and appointing Badhan. This man continued in <br/>
office until God sent Muhammed the prophet. </p>
<p>I was told on the authority of al-Zuhrl that he said that Chosroes wrote to <br/>
Badhan the following letter: </p>
<p>‘I have been told that a man of the Quraysh has come forth in Mecca </p>
<p>asserting that he is a prophet. Go to him and invite him to withdraw. </p>
<p>If he withdraws, well and good, if not, send his head to me.’ </p>
<p>Badhan sent Chosroes’ letter to the apostle of God, who replied, ‘God has <br/>
promised me that Chosroes will be killed on such-and-such a date.’ Now <br/>
when Badhan got this letter he waited to see what would happen, saying that <br/>
if he were a prophet, what he said would come to pass. God killed Chosroes <br/>
on the day which the prophet had named. He was killed by his son Shirawayh. <br/>
Khalid b. Hiqq al-Shaybanl said: </p>
<p>And Chosroes, when his sons cut him in pieces <br/>
With swords as the butcher cuts up joints, </p>
<p>The fates were hatching an evil day for him. </p>
<p>It came, for every child must come to the birth. </p>
<p>Al-Zuhrl said: When the news reached Badhan, he sent word to the apostle <br/>
of God that he and the Persians with him accepted Islam. His messengers <br/>
said to the apostle of God, ‘To whom db we belong?’ He replied, ‘You are <br/>
of us and related to us, the people of the house.’ </p>
<p>I have been told that al-Zuhri said, It was then the apostle of God said, <br/>
‘Salman is of us, the people of the house.’ </p>
<p>This is what Satih meant when he said: ‘A pure prophet to whom revela¬ <br/>
tion will come from on high’, and w'hat Shiqq meant when he said: (his <br/>
kingdom) would be ended by an apostle who would bring truth and justice <br/>
from 1 a people of religion and virtue. Dominion shall rest among his people <br/>
until the Day of Separation. </p>

<p>THE STORY OF THE KING OF AL-HADR </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Khallad b. Qurra b. Khalid al-SadusI on the authority' of Jannad, or of <br/>
one of the learned genealogists in al-Kufa, told me that al-Nu'man b. al- <br/>
Mundhir was descended from Satirun 2 king of al-Hadr, a great fortress built <br/>
like a town on the bank of the Euphrates. It is he to whom 'Adiy b. Zayd <br/>
refers in his lines: </p>
<p>When the master of al-Hadr built it </p>
<p>When the Tigris and Khabur w'ere brought to it 3 </p>
<p>He constructed it of marble and plastered it with gypsum, </p>
<p>Birds nested in its roof. </p>
<p>Yet the fates did not respect it. </p>
<p>Its lordship departed, its gate is forsaken. </p>
<p>1 On p. 6 bayn for min here. </p>
<p>2 According to Noldeke, Gesch. d. Perser u. Araber , p. 33, al-Radr was in ruins by 363 <br/>
and so Shapur (II) cannot have been its destroyer. The point is made by the Cairo editors <br/>
of Ibn Hisham. </p>
<p>3 I.e. the income arising from the land they watered. </p>
<p>yoo The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>He it is to whom Abu Duwad al-Iyadi refers in his line: </p>
<p>I saw that death had descended from al-Hadr, </p>
<p>Upon al-Satirun lord of its people. </p>
<p>This verse occurs in one of his odes, but it is also attributed to Khalaf <br/>
al-Ahmar; others say to Hammad the reciter. </p>
<p>Now Chosroes Sabur Dhu’l-Aktaf 1 had attacked Satirun, king of al-Hadr, <br/>
and besieged the town for two years. One day the latter’s daughter, looking <br/>
down from the castle, had seen Sabur in his silk brocade with his golden <br/>
crown inset with topazes, rubies, and pearls on his head, a fine figure of a <br/>
man, and she sent secretly to ask him if he would marry her if she opened <br/>
the gate to him. He agreed to do so. Night came and Satirun became drunk, <br/>
for he never went to bed sober. She took the keys of the castle from beneath <br/>
his head and sent them with one of her freedmen who opened the gate and <br/>
Sabur came in and killed Satirun and gave al-Hadr to the soldiery and <br/>
destroyed it. He took away the girl and married her. </p>
<p>At night as she was sleeping upon her bed she began to toss about restlessly <br/>
and could not sleep, so he called for a lamp and the bed was searched and a <br/>
myrtle leaf was found in it. Sabur asked if that was the cause of her waking, <br/>
and when she said that it was, he asked how her father had brought her up. <br/>
She answered that he had given her a bed of brocade, clothed her in silk, <br/>
fed her on marrow, and given her wine to drink. ‘If this is the way you <br/>
reward your father you will soon betray me,’ he said, and ordered that her <br/>
hair should be tied to a horse’s tail; the horse galloped away with her until <br/>
she was killed. Here are some lines of A"sha of B. Qays b. Tha'Iaba: </p>
<p>Have you thought of al-Hadr when its people prospered, </p>
<p>But does prosperity ever endure ? </p>
<p>For two years Shahbur kept his armies there <br/>
Smiting it with axes. </p>
<p>When he prayed to his Lord </p>
<p>He turned to him and took no vengeance. 2 </p>
<p>Here are some lines of ‘Adiy b. Zayd on the subject: </p>
<p>Fate descended on al-Hadr from above, </p>
<p>A grievous disaster. </p>
<p>A spoilt darling did not protect her father </p>
<p>When her watchman gave up hope because of her treachery 3 </p>
<p>When she made his evening cup of unmixed wine </p>
<p>(For w-ine destroys the mind of the drinker). </p>
<p>She betrayed her people for a night of love, </p>
<p>Thinking that the prince would marry her. </p>
<p>1 He of the shoulders. </p>
<p>2 A poor sense. Evidently Abu Dharr was not satisfied as he adds to his gloss the phrase <br/>
which refers difficulties to the divine omniscience. </p>
<p>3 This line has given much trouble to commentators. The first word can be read as <br/>
rabt'a, meaning ‘watcher’, and would then refer to the girl looking down from the wall. <br/>
Likhabbihcl, the reading adopted above, is taken from the variant given by the Cairo editors <br/>
in place of the lihaymhn of their and W.’s text. Mas'udi, Afuruju’l-Dhakab , iv. 86, has <br/>
lihubbiha. However, lihaynihd ‘to her own destruction’ is the reading first given by Abu <br/>
Dharr and ‘to her own destruction’ yields a good sense. </p>

the 'Amallq were there at the time, the sons of Tmlaq, or as some say of "Imllq <br/>
b. Lawadh b. Sam b. Nuh—he saw the people worshipping idols, and asked <br/>
what they were. They replied that they were idols which they were wor¬ <br/>
shipping, and when they prayed for rain they got it and when they asked for <br/>
help they received it. He asked them to spare him an idol to take away to the <br/>
land of the Arabs and they gave him one called Hubal. So he took it to <br/>
Mecca and set it up and ordered the people to serve it and to venerate it. </p>

<p>You would not forbid the killing of enemies! </p>

went to Dhu’l-Khalasa to get an oracle from the arrows. When the arrow <br/>
forbidding him to proceed came out he spoke the verses quoted above. <br/>

<p>I was told by a traditionist that the apostle of God sent 'All b. Abu <br/>

back to him. They are in fact the two swords which 'All had. </p>

<p>The second half of the verse was uttered by a man of B. Sa'd. It is <br/>
said that al-Mustaughir b. Rabl'a b. Ka'b b. Sa'd lived 330 years. He, who <br/>
lived longer than any man of Mudar, said: </p>

<li>This is really a verse of al-Aswad b. Ya'fur al-Nahshali, Nahshal being <br/>
the son of Darim b. Malik b. Hanzala b. Malik b. Zayd Manat b. Tamlm. <br/>
Abu Muhriz Khalaf al-Ahmar quoted the verse to me in the form: </li>

<p>The people of al-Khawarnaq and al-Sadir and Bariq <br/>
And the temple Dhu’l-Shurufat of Sindad. 2 </p>

<p>It is said that anything that she gives birth to after that belongs to their <br/>
sons and not their daughters. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AH this information according to the Bedouin is wrong, except so far <br/>
as concerns the Harm; there Ibn Ishaq is right. Among the Arabs the Bahira <br/>
is the she-camel "whose ear is slit and who is not ridden, "whose hair is not <br/>
shorn and whose milk is only drunk by the guest or given in alms, or left to <br/>
their gods. The Sa’iba is a she-camel which a man vows that he will set free <br/>
if he recovers from his sickness or if he gains an object which he seeks; and <br/>
when he has freed a she-camel or a camel for one of their gods, then it runs <br/>
free and pastures, no profit being made from it. The Waslla means a ewe <br/>
whose mother has twins at every birth. Its owner gives the ewes to his gods <br/>
and keeps the males for himself. If her mother gives birth to a male lamb <br/>
with her, they say Wasalat (she has joined) her brother, and her brother is <br/>
freed with her, no profit being made from him. I was given this information <br/>
by Yunus b. Habib the grammarian and others, each contributing his part <br/>
thereto. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The poet says: </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Round the Waslla in Shurayf is a three-vear-old camel, </p>
<p>And those whose backs are taboo and those who are set free. 3 </p>
<p>Tamlm b. Ubayy b. Muqbil, one of B. 'Amir b. Sa'sa'a, said: </p>
<p>Therein is the rumbling of the young onager stallion </p>
<p>Like the grumbling of the DiyafI camel in the midst of the Bahlras. </p>
<p>This verse belongs to one of his odes and the plural of Bahira is Bahair <br/>
and BuJiur. The plural of Waslla is Wasail and Wusul. The plural of <br/>
multitude of Saiba is Saivaib and Suyyab, and the plural of multitude of <br/>
Hami is Hawami. </p>

'Amr b. 'Amir b. Haritha b. Imru’u’l-Qays b. Tha'laba b. Mazin b. al-Asd b. <br/>

<p>When we dropped down to the vale of Mecca, Khuza'a <br/>
Found the home of the tyrant agreeable. </p>
<p>They settled in hordes and sent their horses far afield <br/>
Over every tribe between hill and lowland. </p>
<p>They drove Jurhum from the vale of Mecca and <br/>
Wrapped themselves in Khuza'a’s power and glory. </p>
<p>These verses occur in one of his odes. God willing, I shall refer to the <br/>
expulsion of Jurhum later on. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Others say the name should be spelt al-Haun. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mother of al-Nadr and Malik and Milkan was Barra d. Murr. The <br/>
mother of 'Abdu Manat was Hala d. Suwayd b. al-Ghitrlf b. Azd Shanu’a. <br/>
Shanu’a was 'Abdullah b. Ka'b b. 'Abdullah b. Malik b. Nasr b. al-Asd b. <br/>
al-Ghauth. They were called Shanu’a because of the hatred between them. <br/>
Shan an means hatred. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Al-Nadr is Quraysh, one born of his line is a Qurayshitc, but those outside <br/>
his line are not. Jarir b. 'Atiyya, one of B. Kulavb b. Yarbu' b. Hanzala <br/>
b. Malik b. Zayd Manat b. Tamim, in a eulogy of Hisham b. 'Abdu’l- <br/>
Mallk b. Marwan, said: </p>
<p>The mother w r ho bore Quraysh <br/>
Is of no mean lineage nor sterile, </p>
<p>No sire is nobler than your ancestor, </p>
<p>No maternal uncle nobler than Tamim. </p>
<p>He meant Barra d. Murr sister of Tamim b. Murr, the mother of al-Nadr. <br/>
It is said that Fihr b. Malik is Quraysh, and the line of Quraysh is in his <br/>
descendants alone. The name Quraysh is derived from taqarrush, meaning <br/>
merchandise and profit. Ru’ba b. al-'Ajjaj said: </p>
<p>Fat meat and pure milk <br/>
Make them despise poor wheat <br/>
And the fallings of the doom-palm. 3 </p>
<p>Shughush means ‘wheat’; and khashl means the knobs of anklets and </p>
<p>1 Takhazza a, to separate or remain behind; in this case both meanings apply. </p>
<p>2 This place is an easy day’s journey from Mecca in the direction of Medina. </p>
<p>3 The rendering given above is based on Abu Dharr’s commentary. He rightly abandons <br/>
Ibn Hisham’s opinion in favour of the view of al-Waqashi which suits the context better. </p>
<p>Ibn Hisham s Notes </p>
<p>705 </p>
<p>bracelets and the like: and qurush means trade and profit. The poet means <br/>
that fat and milk used to make them independent of this. Mahd means pure <br/>
milk. ' ' </p>

<p>8o I have heard that one of his sons came to the apostle of God, claiming <br/>
descent from Sama. The apostle said ‘The poet?; and one of his companions <br/>
said: ‘I think, apostle of God, you mean the saying </p>
<p>Many a cup hast thou spilt, O b. Lu’ayy, </p>
<p>For fear of death which otherwise would not have been spilt. </p>
<p>He answered, ‘Yes.’ </p>

<li>This is what Abu 'Ubayda quoted to me from the poem. </li>
</ol>
<p>9 r. Abu 'Ubayda recited these verses to me as from 'Amir b. al-Khasafi, <br/>
i.e. Khasafa b.’Qays b. 'Aylan, adding a line </p>
<p>His spear bereaved women of their sons. </p>
<p>He also told me that Hashim said to 'Amir: ‘Compose a good verse about <br/>
me and I will pay you for it.’ Thereupon 'Amir composed the hrst verse <br/>
which did not please Hashim; he added the second which likewise failed <br/>
to please him, and so with the third; but when he added the fourth, As he <br/>
slew the guilty and the innocent’, he was satisfied and rewarded him. </p>
<p>This is what al-Kumayt b. Zayd meant when he said: </p>
<p>Hashim of Murra who destroyed kings <br/>
Whether they had wronged him or not. </p>
<p>This verse occurs in one of his odes. 'Amir’s words ‘Day of al-Haba at’ <br/>
have not Abu 'Ubayda’s authority. </p>
<p>„ 2 Zuhayr was one of B. Muzayna b. Udd b. Tabikha b. al-Yas b. Mujar. <br/>

A crowd of hornless rams they thought were horned. </p>
<p>We did not say to Bariq, ‘You have done wrong,’ </p>
<p>Nor did we say, ‘Give us satisfaction. </p>
<p>They got the name Bariq because they went about in quest of herbage. </p>

Leave him alone until his camels are rounded up. </p>
<p>i.e. leave him until he gets his camels together, i.e. until he brings them to <br/>
the water and they crowd upon it. Bacca is the place of the temple and the <br/>
mosque. These lines are from 'Aman b. Ka'b b. 'Amr b. Sa'd b. Zayd <br/>

<p>7io The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>war broke out between the Quraysh and their allies the Kinana and Qays <br/>
'Aylan. The cause of it was that 'Urwa al-Rahhal b. 'Utba b. Ja'far b. Kilab <br/>
b. Rabl'a b. 'Amir b. §a'sa'a b. Mu'awiya b. Bakr b. Hawazin had given safe <br/>
conduct to a caravan of al-Nu'man b. al-Mundhir. Al-Barrad b. Qays, one <br/>
of B. Damra b. Bakr b. 'Abdu Manat b. Kinana, said to him, ‘Did you give it <br/>
safe conduct against Kinana? to which he replied, ‘Yes, and against every¬ <br/>
body else.’ So 'Urwa al-Rahhal went out with the caravan and al-Barrad <br/>
also went out with the object of taking him off his guard. When he was in <br/>
Tayman Dhu Tilal in the high ground 'Urw'a failed to post a guard and <br/>
al-Barrad leapt upon him and killed him in the sacred month: that is why <br/>
the war was called sacrilegious. Al-Barrad composed the following lines <br/>
about it: </p>
<p>Many a calamity' which has disquieted men before me <br/>
Have I met with determination, O Banu Bakr. 1 <br/>
I destroyed thereby' the houses of the Banu Kilab <br/>
And I reduced the clients to their proper place. </p>
<p>I lifted my hand against him in Dhu Tilal <br/>
And he fell dizzily like a hewn down tree. </p>
<p>Labld b. Rabfa b. Malik b. Ja'far b. Kilab said: </p>
<p>Tell the Banu Kilab and 'Amir if you meet them <br/>
Great events have those who can deal with them.* </p>
<p>Tell the Banu Numayr if you meet them <br/>
And the uncles of the slain, Banu Hilal, </p>
<p>That the traveller al-Rahhal is dead <br/>
Lying by Tayman Dhu Tilal. </p>
<p>A messenger came to Quraysh saying that al-Barrad had killed 'Urwa <br/>
while they were in 'Ukaz 3 in the sacred month, and they rode off without <br/>
the knowledge of Hawazin. When the latter heard of it they pursued them <br/>
and overtook them before they reached the sacred territory, and they fought <br/>
till nightfall. When they entered the sacred territory Hawazin gave up the <br/>
fight. Sporadic encounters took place on the following days, but the people <br/>
had no commander-in-chief, each tribe being commanded by its head. The <br/>
apostle was present at some of these encounters, his uncles having taken him <br/>
with them. He used to say that he picked up the arrows which the enemy <br/>
had shot and gave them to his uncles to shoot. </p>
<ol>
<li>The story of the struggle is too long to be mentioned here. I cannot <br/>
allow it to interrupt the prophet’s biography. </li>
</ol>
<p>1 The line occurs in a different form in al-lqd al-Farid. Cf. Yaq. iii. 579 and Agh. <br/>
Xix- 75 ‘ </p>
<p>2 The text, metre, and translation in Brockelmann’s edition (p. 57 Arabic and p. 61 <br/>
German) are at fault here. There is a play on the word mawdli rendered ‘clients’ in the first <br/>
poem; here it means ‘masters’. Mould is one of those elusive terms whose meaning can be <br/>
determined only by the context. Originally it meant a relative pure and simple without <br/>
differentiating between a tribesman by birth or by sworn alliance. Already in the poetry <br/>
of the Sira the mould is lower than the famim or forth, the pure-blooded tribesman. Cf. <br/>
528. 15 hilfuha tva-famimuha. In the Quran mould means ‘lord’ and also ‘helper’. After the <br/>
Arab conquests the word meant ‘client’, ‘freed slave’. </p>
<p>3 On the site of ’Uka? cf. the excellent article with map by ffaniad al-Jasir in the Majalla <br/>
of the Arab Academy of Damascus, 1951, iii- 377 f-, where 1 . 1 . is cited from Shifd'ul - <br/>

<p>Ibrahim’s mother was Mariya the Copt. Abdullah b. Wahb from I. <br/>

<p>Abu 'Ubayda the grammarian told me that B. 'Amir b. Sa sa a b. <br/>
Mu'awiya b. Bakr b. Hawazin entered into this with them, and he quoted to <br/>
me the lines of 'Amr b. Ma'dikarib: </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>O 'Abbas, if our horses had been in good fettle </p>
<p>In Tathlith you would not have vied with the Hums in my absence. </p>
<p>Tathllth is a place in their country and shiyar means fat and well formed. <br/>
By Hums he means B. 'Amir b. Sa'sa'a; and by 'Abbas he means 'Abbas b. <br/>
Mirdas al-Sulaml who had raided B. Zubayd in Tathllth. He quoted to me <br/>
the verse of Laqlt b. Zurara al-Dariml about the battle of Jabala: </p>
<p>Speed, O my horse, the Banu 'Abs are a great people 1 among the Hums <br/>
because B. 'Abs were allies of B. 'Amir b. Sa'sa'a at the battle of Jabala. <br/>
This battle was between B. Hanzala b. Malik b. Zayd Manat b. Tamim <br/>
and B. 'Amir b. Sa'sa'a. The victory went to B. 'Amir, and Laqlt was killed, <br/>
and Hajib b. Zurara b. 'Uds was taken prisoner. 'Amr b. 'Amr b. 'Uds b. <br/>
Zayd b. 'Abdullah b. Darim b. Malik b. Hanzala fled, and Jarir said to <br/>
al-Farazdaq in reference to him: </p>

<p>B. Amir and Hassan b. Mu'awiya al-Kindl was slain. He was known as <br/>
Ibn Kabsha.  azid b. aI~Sa aq al-Kilabl was taken prisoner and al- r fufayl <br/>
b. Malik b. Ja'far b. Kilab the father of 'Amir b. al-Tufayl fled. About him <br/>

<p>When the cavalry met he encountered a man who shattered his skull. 2 </p>
<p>The story of the battles of Jabala and Dhu Najab is too long to be dealt <br/>
with here for the reasons given when the Sacrilegious War was discussed. </p>

<li>Rahaq means rebellion and folly, as in the line of Ru’ba b. al-'Ajjaj: <br/>
When fever makes the vicious camel mad. [Cf. Dlzvdn xli. 4.] </li>
</ol>
<p>This verse occurs in one of his rajaz poems. Rahaq also means seeking a <br/>
thing until you get near it whether you take it or not. The same poet, <br/>
describing wild asses, says: </p>
<p>Their tails flick and they shudder w'hen they fear they will be overtaken. </p>
<p>The word is also used as a masdar. ‘I have borne ( rahiqtu ) a crime or hard¬ <br/>
ship which you have laid upon me as a heavy burden.’ It is used in the <br/>
Quran in the same sense: ‘We feared that he would press hardly upon them <br/>
in rebellion and unbelief’ (18. 79); also, ‘Do not treat me harshly for what I <br/>
have done* (18. 72). </p>
<ol>
<li>Al-Ghaytala was of B. Murra b. 'Abdu Manat b. Kinana, brothers <br/>
of Mudlij b. Murra. She was the mother of the Ghayatil whom Abu Talib <br/>
mentions in his lines: </li>
</ol>
<p>Foolish are the minds of the people who exchanged us <br/>
For the Banu Khalaf and the Ghayatil. </p>
<p>Ghayatil is the name given to her sons among B. Sahm b. 'Amr b. Husays. </p>

<p>This is saj r , not poetry. </p>
</li>

<p>Another version is ‘A man will cry in eloquent language, saying, There <br/>
is no God but Allah.’ </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>An authority on poetry recited to me the following lines: </p>
<p>I was amazed at the jinn and their dumbfounding, </p>
<p>As they saddled their beasts with their cloths, </p>
<p>Making for Mecca, seeking guidance. </p>
<p>Believing jinn are not like impure jinn. </p>
<p>1 A reference to the ancient belief that owls came forth from the skulls of the slain and <br/>
remained by their graves. The text in Naq. 386. 3 is superior. </p>
<p>2 This is the meaning given to mi$qa by A. Dh. (cf. Naq. 835. 4). The rendering given <br/>
by Weil is rightly rejected by the Arabic commentators, though the alteration of damma <br/>
‘meeting’ to dajja ‘clamour’ seems to be due to someone who gave the more usual meaning <br/>
of ‘loud-voiced’ or ‘eloquent’ to mifqa'. </p>

<p>Yastaftihun means ‘they asked for help’. It also means ‘they arbitrated’ <br/>

Found fault with their company; </p>

<p>These verses really belong to an ode of Umayya b. Abu’l-Salt, except for <br/>
the first tw'O, the fifth, and the last verse. The second half of the first verse <br/>
does not come via 1.1. </p>

<li>
<p>AI-HadramI was 'Abdullah b. 'Imad b. Akbar, one of the Sadif whose <br/>
name was 'Amr b. Malik, one of the Sakun b. Ashras b. Kindi (some say <br/>
Kinda) b. Thaur b, Marta' b. 'Aflr b. 'Adly b. al-Harith b. Murra b. Udad b. <br/>

Marta' b. Malik b. Zayd b. Kahlan b. Saba’. </p>

<p>Another reading is: ‘Piety preserves, not pride.’ The words ‘facing the <br/>
Ka'ba’ are from a traditionist. </p>

<li>
<p>The first two verses of this poem are attributed to Umayya b. Abu <br/>
al-Salt and the last verse occurs in one of his odes. The words ‘vain idols’ <br/>
have not I.I.’s authority. </p>

<li>
<p>The Arabs say tahannuth and tahannuj meaning the Ilanifite religion, <br/>
substituting / for th , just as they say jadath and jadaf meaning a grave. <br/>
Ru’ba b. al-'Ajjaj said: </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If my stones were with the other gravestones ( ajdaf ), meaning ajdath. </p>
<p>This verse belongs to a rajaz poem of his, and the verse of Abu Talib to an <br/>
ode by him which I will mention, please God, in the proper place. Abu <br/>
'Ubayda told me that the Arabs say famma instead of thurnma. </p>

<p>Qasb here means a hollow pearl. One in whom I have confidence told <br/>
me that Gabriel came to the apostle and said, ‘Give Khadija greetings from <br/>
her Lord,’ The apostle said, ‘O Khadija, Gabriel proclaims peace to you <br/>
from your Lord.’ She replied, ‘God is peace, from Him comes peace, and <br/>
peace be upon Gabriel.’ </p>

<p>Saja means ‘to be quiet’. Umayya b. Abu’l-Salt the Thaqafite {Duean <br/>
xviii) said: </p>

<p>When he came by night my friend was asleep <br/>
And the night was quiet in blackest gloom. </p>

<p>You can say of the eye when its glance is fixed it is sdjia. </p>
<p>Jarir said; </p>
<p>They shot you as they went with quiet eyes <br/>
Slaying you from between the howdah curtains. </p>
<p>'A'il means ‘poor’. </p>
<p>Abu Khirash al-Hudhali said: </p>
<p>The destitute went to his house in winter </p>
<p>A poor man clad in two garments finding his way by the barking of the <br/>
dogs. 1 </p>
<p>The plural is 'ala and 'uyyal. 'A'il also means one who has a large family <br/>
and one who is afraid; and in the Quran ‘That is more likely that you will <br/>
not be unjust’ (4. 3). </p>
<p>Abu Talib said; </p>
<p>In a just balance he gives full weight of barley. </p>
<p>He is in himself an unerring witness. (See further 175. 17.) </p>
<p>'A'il also means a tiresome, wearisome thing; you can say, ‘this thing has <br/>
exhausted me’ alani , i.e. oppressed and wearied me. <br/>

Bakr b. 'Auf b. 'Udhra b. Zayd Aliat b. Rufayda b. Thaur b. Kalb b. <br/>
Wabra. Hakim b. Hizam b. Khuwaylid had come from Syria with a party <br/>
of slaves among whom was Zayd, then a young man. His aunt, who by that <br/>
time was the apostle’s wife, came to see him and he invited her. to choose <br/>
anyone of the young slaves she liked. She chose Zayd and took him away <br/>
with her. When the apostle saw him he asked her to give him to him. She <br/>
did so and he freed him and adopted him as his son. This was before revela¬ <br/>
tion came to him. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>His father Haritha was exceeding sorrowful at his loss and mourned him <br/>
in the following verse: </p>
<p>I wept over Zayd, not knowing what had happened— </p>
<p>W'hether I could hope to see him again or whether he was dead. </p>
<p>By God I do not know, often though I ask, </p>
<p>Whether he lies dead on hill or plain. </p>
<p>Would that I knew if thou wouldst ever return! </p>
<p>All that I ask of the world is that thou return to me. </p>
<p>Sunrise reminds me of him; the sunset brings his memory before me. 2 <br/>
When the winds blow they stir up thoughts of him. </p>
<p>1 The word mustanbih means the man who at night imitates the barking of dogs so that <br/>
if an encampment is near the dogs will take Up his challenge and he can find his way to food <br/>
and warmth from the direction their barking gives him. The two ragged garments are the <br/>
gown and the waistband, tire indispensable minimum. </p>

<p>Long will I grieve and fear for him! </p>
<p>I shall use the best camels in scouring the land <br/>
Nor weary of searching though the camels tire, </p>
<p>So long as I live till death comes to me. </p>
<p>For all must die, though hope deceives men. </p>
<p>Then he came to him while he was with the apostle, who told Zayd that <br/>
he could stay with him or if he preferred go away with his father. He replied <br/>
that he would certainly stay with him, and he remained with the apostle until <br/>
God made him His prophet, when he believed in him, prayed with him, and <br/>
became a Muslim. When God revealed ‘name them after their fathers’ <br/>
(Sura 33. 5) he said, ‘I am Zayd b. Haritha.’ </p>

<p>Abu Bakr’s name was 'Abdullah. He was called 'Atlq because of his <br/>
fine handsome face. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The words ‘at his invitation’ are not from 1 . 1 . 'akama ‘hold back’ <br/>
means talabbuth ‘delay’, as in the line of Ru’ba b. al-'Ajjaj: </p>

</ol>
<p>Waththab took her away and delayed not {'akama). </p>

<ol>
<li>'Anz b. Wa’il was the brother of Bakr of Rabfa b. Nizar. </li>
</ol>
<p>I57&gt; The reason he was called al-Nahham was because the apostle said, <br/>
‘I heard his singing in Paradise.’ His nahm means his voice. </p>

<p>He had been born a slave among al-Asd; he was a black and Abu Bakr <br/>
bought him from them. </p>

al-Namir b. Qasit said that he was a prisoner in Byzantine territory and was 
bought from them. There is a tradition of the prophet which runs: ‘\)</span>uhayb <br/>

And a shuffler thereof dealing out the arrows and proclaiming what he <br/>
produced. </p>
<p>i.e. distinguishing the arrows and making their shares clear. [The allusion <br/>
is to the game of maystr which w r as popular among the ancient Arabs. See <br/>

<ol>

<p>Firm in jaw, angry in visage, a biter, <br/>
describing a forbidding face. </p>
<p>1 71. The singular of idin is ’ ida . \ou say addauhu , meaning they divided <br/>
it’ as in the line of Ru’ba </p>
<p>The religion of God is not divided. </p>

<li>This is as much of the ode as seems to me to be genuine; many com¬ <br/>
petent authorities on verse deny the authenticity of most of it. </li>

<p>A man I can trust told me that in a year of drought the people of Medina <br/>
came to the apostle and complained of their trouble. He mounted the pulpit <br/>
and prayed for rain. Hardly had the rain begun than the people living in <br/>
exposed districts came to complain that they were inundated. The apostle <br/>
said: ‘O God, round us, not on us!’ Thereupon the clouds moved away <br/>
from the town itself and encircled it like a crown. The apostle said, If <br/>
Abu Talib could but have- seen this day how he would have rejoiced!’ One <br/>
of his companions said, ‘I suppose you refer to his line: </p>
<p>A noble man for whose sake the clouds drop rain, </p>
<p>The support of orphans and the defence of widows,’ </p>
<p>and he said ‘Quite so.’ </p>
<p>The expression ‘its bushes’ is not from 1 . 1 . </p>

<li>He was called al-Akhnas because he withdrew ( khanasa ) with the people <br/>
at the battle of Badr. Of course his name was Ubayy; he came from B. <br/>

</ol>
<p>Ibn Hisham’s Notes </p>

<li>
<p>The words ‘allied themselves with treacherous people against us’ refer <br/>
to B. Bakr b. 'Abdu Manat b. Kinana. These arc the Arabs whom Abu <br/>
'falib mentions in his verse above. [See p. 127, n. 4.] </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 . 1 , relates Abu Qays here to B, Waqif, whereas in the story of the <br/>
elephant he is related to Khatma. The reason is that the Arabs often relate <br/>
a man to the brother of his grandfather if he happens to be better known. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Abu ’Ubayda told me that al-Hakam b. ’Amr al-Ghifari was of the sons <br/>
of Nu’ayla, brother of Ghifar b. Mulayl. Nu’ayla was the son of Mulayl <br/>
b. Damra b. Bakr b. ’Abdu Manat. They had said that 'Utba w r as the son <br/>
of Ghazwan al-Sulami, he being of the sons of Mazin b. Mansur; Sulaym was <br/>
I. Mansur. Abu Qays was of B. Wa’il; Wa’il, Waqif, and Khatma are <br/>
brothers of al-Aus. </p>
<ol>
<li>The line *’tis as water poured at random’, and the verse ‘if you buy <br/>
spears’, &amp;c., and ‘men’s Lord has chosen a religion’ and ‘his cavalry was in <br/>
the plains’ were quoted to me by Abu Zayd al-Ansari and others. As to his <br/>
words ‘Know you not what happened in the war of Dahis?’ Abu ’Ubayda <br/>
told me that Dahis was a horse belonging to Qays b. Zuhayr b. Jadhlma b. <br/>
Rawaha b. Rabfa b. al-Harith b. Mazin b. Qutay’a b. 'Abs b. Baghid b. <br/>
Rayth b. Ghatafan which he raced against a mare of Hudhayfa b. Badr <br/>
b. ’Amr b. Zayd b. Ju’ayya b. Laudhan b. Tha’laba b. 'Adiy b. Fazara b. <br/>
Dhubyan b. Baghid b. Rayth b. Ghatafan called al-Ghabra’. Hudhayfa hid <br/>
some of his men in ambush and ordered them to hit Dahis in the face if they <br/>
saw him taking the lead. This is precisely what happened, and so Ghabra’ <br/>
came in first. When the rider of Dahis came in he told Qays what had <br/>
happened, and his brother Malik b. Zuhayr got up and slapped al-Ghabra <br/>
in the face, whereupon Hamal b. Badr got up and slapped Malik’s face. <br/>
Afterwards Abu’l-Junaydib al-’Absi fell in w r ith ’Auf b. Hudhayfa and killed <br/>
him; then a man of the B. Fazara met Malik and killed him, and Hamal, <br/>
Hudhayfa’s brother, said: </li>
</ol>
<p>We have killed Malik in revenge for ’Auf. </p>
<p>If you try to get more than your due from us you will be sorry. </p>
<p>Al-Rabf b. Ziyad al-’Absi said: </p>
<p>After Malik b. Zuhayr has been killed, </p>
<p>Can women hope for carnal delights P 1 </p>
<p>Thus war broke out between 'Abs and Fazara, and Hudhayfa b. Badr and <br/>
his brother Hamal were killed. Qays b. Zuhayr was grieved and composed <br/>
an elegy on him: </p>
<p>How many a knight who is no knight is called (to war) </p>
<p>But at al-Haba’a there was a true knight. </p>
<p>So weep for Hudhayfa; you will not mourn his like <br/>
Until tribes not yet born shall have perished. </p>
<p>He also said: </p>
<p>The young man Hamal b. Badr did wrong, </p>
<p>And injustice is an evil food. </p>
<p>1 i.e. War will break out and then sexual relations will be taboo. </p>
<p>y 18 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Al-Harith b. Zuhayr the brother of Qays said: </p>
<p>I left at al-Haba’a without pride <br/>
Hudhayfa’s body ’mid the broken spears. </p>
<p>Some say that Qays raced the horses Dahl's and al-Ghabra’, while Hud- <br/>
hayfa raced al-Khattar and al-Hanfa’; but the first account is the sounder. <br/>
I cannot go into the story further because it interrupts the apostle’s biography. </p>
<p>As to the words ‘war of Hafib’ the reference is to Hapb b. al-Harith b. <br/>
Qays b. Haysha b. al-Harith b. Umayya b. Mu'awiya b. Malik b. 'Auf b. <br/>
'Amr b. 'Auf b. Malik b. al-Aus who had killed a Jew under the protection <br/>
of al-Khazraj. So Yazid b. al-Harith b. Qays b. Malik b. Ahmar b. Haritha <br/>
b. Tha'Iaba b. Ka'b b. al-Khazraj b. al-Harith b. al-Khazraj known as Ibn <br/>
Fushum from his mother Fushum, a woman of al-Qayn b. Jasr, went out by <br/>
night with a number of B. Harith b. al-Khazraj and killed Hatib. Thus war <br/>
broke out between al-Aus and al-Khazraj and was waged bitterly until <br/>
victory' went to al-Khazraj. Suwayd b. §amit b. Khalid b. 'Atiyya b. Hau{ <br/>
b. Habib b. 'Amr b. 'Auf b. Malik b. al-Aus was killed by al-Mujadhdhir <br/>
b. Dhiyad al-BalawI whose name was 'Abdullah, an ally of B. 'Auf b. <br/>
al-Khazraj. Al-Mujadhdhir went out with the apostle to the battle of <br/>
Uhud and al-Harith b. Suwayd went out with him. Al-Harith took al- <br/>
Mujadhdhir off his guard and killed him in revenge for his father. (I shall <br/>
mention the story in its proper place if God will.) I cannot go into the <br/>
details of the war which followed for the reasons which have been given <br/>
already. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A learned traditionist told me that the worst treatment that the apostle <br/>
met from Quraysh was one day when he went out and everyone that met him, <br/>
free or slave, called him a liar and insulted him. He returned to his house <br/>
and wrapped himself up because of the violence of the shock. Then God <br/>
revealed to him, ‘O thou that art enwrapped, Rise and warn’ (Sura 74). </p>

<p>bakhi'un nafsak means ‘committing suicide’ according to what Abu <br/>
‘Ubayda told me. Dhu’l-Rumma said: </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>O thou that destroyest thyself </p>
<p>In longing for that which fate has taken from thee. </p>
<p>The plural is bakhi'un and bakha'a. The Arabs say ‘I have impressed <br/>
{bakha'a) my advice upon him’, i.e. I have laboured so to do. </p>
<ol>
<li>Sa'id means ‘the ground’; pi. suud. Dhu’l-Rumma, describing a <br/>
little gazelle, said: </li>
</ol>
<p>In the morning it leapt gaily over the ground </p>
<p>As though wine coursed through the very bones of its head. </p>
<p>Sa'id also means ‘the way’, as you find in the tradition ‘Beware of sitting by <br/>
the wayside’ meaning the road. The word juruz means ‘barren land’, pi. <br/>
ajrdz. You can say sana juruz, ‘a barren year’, and sinuna ajraz, i.e. years in </p>
<p>Ibn Hishdm's Notes </p>
<p>719 </p>
<p>which no rain falls, and drought, desolation, and hardship result. The same <br/>
poet describing camels wrote: </p>
<p>Their bellies contain naught but disease and barrenness. </p>
<p>They are nothing but inflated bones. </p>
<ol>
<li>Raqlm is the book in which their story was inscribed ( ruqima ), pi. <br/>
ruqum. AI-'Ajjaj said: </li>
</ol>
<p>The place of the inscribed volume ( muraqqam ). </p>
<ol>
<li>Shafap means ‘exaggeration and going beyond what is right’. A'shS <br/>
of B. Qays b. Tha'laba said: </li>
</ol>
<p>They will not cease, nothing will halt the wicked <br/>
But a thrust in which the oil and the wick perish. </p>
<p>[i.e. a deadly wound. Dizvdn, ed. R. Geyer, xlviii. 1. 1, beginning hal not la <br/>
as here]. </p>
<ol>
<li>Tazazvara means ‘to incline’ from zur . Imru’ul-Qays b. Hujr said: </li>
</ol>
<p>I am a chief; if I return a king </p>
<p>Twill be in such a way as to make the guide appear to be going astray. <br/>
Abu’l-Zahf al-Kulaybi describing a district said: </p>
<p>The coarse salt herbage is not what we want. </p>
<p>To do without water for five days makes the camels thin. </p>
<p>Taqridukum dhdta l-shimdli means passing them and leaving them on the <br/>
left. Dhu’l-Rumma said: </p>
<p>To howdahs which passed by the sand-dunes of Mushrif <br/>
To the left while on their right are the horsemen. </p>
<p>[A.Dh. says that fazvaris means sandhills.] </p>
<p>Fajwa means ‘space’, pi. fijd as the poet says: </p>
<p>You clothed your people with shame and debasement <br/>
Until they became outlaws and forsook the space where their dwelling <br/>
was. </p>
<ol>
<li>Wasid means ‘a door’. 'Ubayd b. Wahb al-'Absi said: </li>
</ol>
<p>In a desert land its door wide open to me <br/>
In which my merits are not unknown. </p>
<p>Wasid also means ‘courtyard’. Plurals tvasd'id, wusud, uusddn, and usud and <br/>
usdan. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>His name was Alexander. He built Alexandria and it was named after <br/>
him. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yanbu means ‘water which bursts forth from the earth’. The plural is <br/>
yandbi. Ibn Harma, whose name was Ibrahim b. 'All al-Fihri, said: </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you shed a tear in every dwelling </p>
<p>Their source would dry, but your tears w-ould be a spring {yanbu). </p>
<p>720 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Kisaf means ‘portions of punishment’. The singular is kisfa, like sidra ; it is <br/>
also the singular of kisf. Qabll is that which is opposite before the eyes; <br/>
compare God’s saying, ‘Punishment will come to them straight in their <br/>
faces’, i.e. visibly (Sura 18. 53). </p>
<p>Abu ‘Ubayda quoted to me the lines jo( A'sha of the Banu Qays: </p>
<p>I will befriend you until you do the same again, </p>
<p>Like the cry of the woman in travail, whom her midwife helps. 1 </p>
<p>She is thus called because she faces her and receives her child. Qabll <br/>
with the plural qubul means ‘gathering’, as in the Quran, ‘We will gather <br/>
to them everything in groups’ (Sura 6. 111). The plural is like subid <br/>
and surur and qumus, all of the fa'll form. Qabll also occurs in a proverb: <br/>
‘He does not know the comer from the goer’, i.e. he does not know how to <br/>
distinguish what is coming forward from what is going back. Al-Kumayt b. <br/>
Zayd said, ‘Affairs were so divided in their view that they could not tell the <br/>
comer from the goer.’ It is said that by this word qabll is meant ‘a thread’. <br/>
What is twisted towards the forearm is the qabll, and what is twisted towards <br/>
the ends of the fingers is the dablr, so called because it comes forward and <br/>
goes back, as I have explained. It is said that the thread of the spindle when <br/>
it is twisted towards the knee is the qabll, and when it is twisted towards the <br/>
thigh it is the dablr. Qabll also is used of a man’s tribe. Zukhruf means <br/>
‘gold’. Muzakhraf means ‘adorned with gold’. Al-‘Ajjaj said: ‘A ruined <br/>
house, whose outlines you would think was a book, gilded and illuminated.’ <br/>
You can call any ornamented thing muzakhraf. </p>
<ol>
<li>Nasfa'an means ‘we will seize and drag’, as the poet said: </li>
</ol>
<p>A people, who when they hear a cry for help, </p>
<p>You see them bridling their mares or taking hold of their forelocks. </p>
<p>The nddl means ‘the meeting place in which people gather together and <br/>
settle their affairs’ as in the book of God, ‘And commit not wickedness in <br/>
your assembly’. Another form of the word is nadt. ‘Abid b. al-Abra$ said: </p>
<p>Look to your own affairs, for I belong to the Banu Asad, </p>
<p>A people of assemblies, generosity, and meetings. </p>
<p>And in the book of God, ‘and the best as a company’ (19. 74). The plural is <br/>
andiya. ‘Let him call his gang’ is like the expression ‘ask the city’ (12. 82), <br/>
meaning, of course, the people of the city. </p>
<p>Salama b. Jandal, one of B. Sa‘d b. Zayd Manat b. Tamim said: </p>
<p>There were two days, one a day of conference and meetings, </p>
<p>And a day given up to a foray against the enemy. </p>
<p>And Al-Kumayt b. Zayd said: </p>
<p>No verbose prattlers in the assembly <br/>
And none silent under duress. 2 </p>
<p>1 So A.Dh. But cf. Geyer’s Diwan of al-A'sha (Gibb Memorial Series), 124, where the <br/>
reading is qabul (not qabll) and where the unknown expositor (cf. pp. xviii f.) shows that <br/>
the context demands an oath: 'I will not befriend you'; tabuu , he says, means tdtarifu. </p>
<p>% Inasmuch as afmata is both transitive and intransitive it would be possible to translate <br/>
by ‘nor silencing others by violence </p>
<p>Ibn His ham's Notes </p>
<p>721 </p>
<p>Nadi means ‘those sitting together’ and zabdniya means ‘rough, violent <br/>
people’, and in this context ‘the guardians of Hell’. In reference to this world <br/>
it means the troops who act as a man s bodyguard’, and the singular is <br/>
zibniya. </p>
<p>Ibn al-Ziba‘ra said in reference to them: </p>
<p>Lavish in hospitality, thrusting in battle, </p>
<p>Zabdniya, violent, coarse are their minds. </p>
<p>He means ‘violent’. §akhr b. ‘Abdullah al-Hudhali, the ‘erring §akhr’, said : </p>

that a deacon came to Mecca in pagan times, a man so handsome as to excite <br/>
general admiration. ‘Utba b. Rabfa, who was the maternal uncle of Sham- <br/>
mas, said, ‘I will bring you a Shammas more handsome than he,’ and he <br/>
fetched his sister’s son ‘Uthman b. ‘Uthman, and so he was called Shammas <br/>

<p>A traditionist told me that his son added, ‘May God reward him well,’ <br/>

<p>The day that Qutayla showed us a lovely neck <br/>
Which necklaces adorned </p>
<p>[Diwan , p. 140. 6 (with unimportant variants)]. The plural is ajydd. Masad <br/>
is fibre crushed like cotton, and rope is twisted from it. Al-Nabigha al- <br/>
Dhubyani whose name was Ziyad b. 'Amr b. Mu'awiya said: </p>
<p>Many a fat young mare has a tooth </p>

<p>Humaza is one who insults a man publicly. He shuts his eyes upon him <br/>
and winks at him. Hassan b. Thabit said: </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I bit into you with a rhyme that burnt like fire <br/>
And you grovelled in humiliation. 2 </p>
<p>Plural humazdt. Lumaza is one who insults a man secretly. Ru’ba b. <br/>
al-Hajjaj said: </p>
<p>In the shadow of him who oppresses, despises, and slanders me. <br/>
Plural lumaza. </p>
<ol>
<li>Affak means ‘liar’. Cf. ‘Lo, it is of their lying that they say God has <br/>
begotten. Verily they tell a lie’ (Sura 37. 151). Ru’ba said: </li>
</ol>
<p>Not of a man who uttered a lying speech. </p>
<ol>
<li>The hasab of Gehenna is everything that is kindled in it. Abu Dhu’ayb <br/>
al-Hudhall whose name was Khuwaylid b. Khalid said: </li>
</ol>
<p>Quench, do not kindle, and do not feed the flame <br/>
Of war lest its horrors hasten on you. </p>
<p>Another reading is ‘And do not be the firestick’ [the equivalent of our poker. <br/>
Diwan xxx, C. 6]. As the poet says: </p>
<p>I stirred up my fire for him and he saw the blaze. </p>
<p>Unless I had stirred it he would have missed the way. </p>
<ol>
<li>Muhl means molten bronze or lead or any other metal, according to <br/>
what Abu ‘‘Ubayda told me. We were told that al-Hasan b. Abu’l-Hasan <br/>
al-Basri said: “Abdullah b. Mas r ud was put in charge of the treasury of <br/>
Kufa by ‘Umar. One day he ordered silver to be melted down, and it began <br/>

<p>2 The circle of ideas is magical. It will be found that all words of cursing, slandering, </p>

<p>Did your sore eyes not close the night </p>
<p>You lay sleepless as though a snake had bitten you? </p>
<p>’Twas not for desire of women, for before this <br/>
You had forgotten the society of Mahdad. </p>
<p>But I see that Time the deceiver </p>
<p>Destroys again what my hands have repaired. </p>
<p>Youth, maturity, and wealth I’ve lost. </p>
<p>In God’s name, how this Time does change! </p>
<p>Ever since I was young have I sought wealth <br/>
In all four stages of man’s growth. </p>
<p>I made full use of the swift tawny camels </p>
<p>Racing across the land between al-Nujayr and §arkhad. </p>
<p>If you ask about me (and many an importunate <br/>
Asks about A’sha) whither he has gone <br/>
O you who ask me whither they are going, </p>
<p>I tell you they have a meeting with the people of Medina. </p>
<p>She urges forward her swift hindlegs, </p>
<p>Folding back her forelegs but not as though hobbled. </p>
<p>In the noonday’s savage heat she’s frisky <br/>
When you’d think the chameleon would sink his head. 2 <br/>
I swore I would not spare her fatigue <br/>
Or footsoreness till we met Muhammad. </p>
<p>When she kneels at the door of Hashim’s son <br/>
She may rest and partake of his bounty. </p>
<p>A prophet who sees what you cannot see, </p>
<p>Whose reputation has reached the lowlands and the hills. </p>
<p>His gifts and presents are not intermittent: </p>
<p>If he gives today it does not stop him giving tomorrow. </p>
<p>I adjure thee, did you not hear the counsel of Muhammad <br/>
The prophet of God when he counselled and witnessed! </p>
<p>If you do not travel with provision of piety </p>
<p>And ^fter death meet one who has taken such provision </p>
<p>You will regret that you are not like him </p>

<p>When he was near Mecca or actually in it one of the heathen Quraysh met <br/>
him and he told him that he was making for the apostle of God to adopt <br/>
Islam. He said to him, ‘O Abu Ba?ir, he prohibits fornication!’ Al-A’sh5 <br/>
replied, But that’s something I’ve no desire for.’ ‘Ah, but he forbids wine!’ <br/>
Now that’s something that I still take pleasure in. I will go away and drink <br/>
long and deeply for a year and then return and accept Islam.’ So he went <br/>
away and died in the year, so that he did not return to the apostle. </p>

but of normal height; his hair was not too curly nor lank, but definitely curly; <br/>
his face was not fat nor rounded; it was white tinged with red; his eyes were <br/>
black, fringed with long lashes; he was firmly knit and broad shouldered; <br/>
the hair on his body was fine, thick on hands and feet. When he walked he <br/>
picked his feet up smartly as though he were going down hill, when he <br/>
turned he turned his whole body; between his shoulders was the seal of <br/>
prophecy, he being the seal of the prophets., He was the most generous of <br/>
men, the boldest, most veracious, most faithful to his undertaking; the <br/>
gentlest, with easy manners, the noblest in social intercourse. Those who <br/>
saw him for the first time were overcome with awe; those who knew him <br/>
well loved him. Neither before nor after him have I seen his like. God bless <br/>

When 'Umar came to power Umm Jamil came to him, for she thought that <br/>
he was his brother and when her genealogy had been given he knew her <br/>

active service. I know how much he owes you.’ So he made her a gift as <br/>
though she were a traveller. The narrator says: I.H. said, Dirar had met <br/>
'Umar at the battle of Badr when he began to beat him with the flat of his <br/>
sword saying, ‘Be off with you, I. al-Kha{tab, I will not kill you!’ 'Umar <br/>
remembered this in his favour after he had become a Muslim. [This is a <br/>
passage which W. relegated to his critical notes, but C. prints it without <br/>
comment. The expression ‘The narrator ( rawi) said’ is unique in the Sira <br/>
and therefore to be suspected; on the other hand, the story rings true.] </p>

<p>He would rather drink deadly poison than perjure himself <br/>
In loyalty to him. And al-Qauqili b. $amit <br/>

<p>Abu Haytham also was faithful, </p>

<p>You cannot hope to get Ibn Hudayr’s help. </p>

volunteered to do so and came to Mecca secretly. He met a woman carrying <br/>
some food and asked her w r here she was going. She said that she was going <br/>
to two prisoners, and he followed her so that he could learn where they were. <br/>
He found that they were in a house which had no roof, and when night fell <br/>
he climbed the wall; then he took a stone and put it under their fetters and <br/>
cut them through with a stroke of his sword. For this reason his sword was <br/>
called ‘the stone-cutter’. Then he mounted them on his camel and led them <br/>
away. He stumbled and cut his toe and said: </li>
</ol>
<p>You are naught but a toe that bled. </p>
<p>This has happened to you in the way of Allah. </p>
<p>Then he took them to the apostle in Medina. [W. ascribes this passage to <br/>

‘You came to us a penniless beggar and have acquired wealth among us, <br/>
and then you think that you can go off with your money. By God, that shall <br/>
not be!’ However, Suhayb was so eager to be off that he made his money <br/>
over to them, and when the apostle heard of it he exclaimed twice: ‘Suhayb <br/>
has made a profit!’ </p>

two pieces of wood for the clapper he heard in his sleep a voice saying, <br/>
“Don’t make a clapper but call to prayer’’. So he went to the apostle to tell <br/>
him of what he had seen and the prophet himself had actually had a revela¬ <br/>

<p>Making plainly visible the midst of the w-aters w hich w as covered w ith <br/>

<li>Mann is something which fell on their trees in the early morning and <br/>
they used to gather it; it is sweet like honey. They both ate and drank of it. <br/>

</ol>
<p>If they were given manna and quails to eat on the ground <br/>
A man would never see good food among them! </p>
<p>Salzva are birds, singular salwat ; another name for them is sumdrta. Honey, <br/>
too, is called salzva. Khalid b. Zuhayr al-Hudhall said: </p>

<p>You’re sweeter than honey fresh from the comb. </p>

Pieces like silver among the pure w r heat. </p>
<p>Wadhil means pieces of silver and fum is flour; singular fuma. </p>
<ol>
<li>Ilia amdnlya means ‘except reciting’ because the ummi is one who <br/>
can recite but cannot write. He says that they do not know how to write but <br/>
they can read a book. I.H. said on the authority of Abu 'Ubayda and Yunus <br/>
that they interpreted what God says to refer to the Arabs. Abu 'Ubayda <br/>
told me about that. Yunus b. Habib the grammarian and Abu 'Ubayda told <br/>
me that the Arabs say tamanna in the sense of ‘he recited’ and in the Quran <br/>
w r e find ‘We never sent an apostle or a prophet before thee but when he <br/>
recited Satan cast (something) into his recitations’ (Sura 22. 51). [As the <br/>
sequel shows, this could mean: ‘w'hen he desired something Satan cast <br/>
something into his desire.’] Abu 'Ubayda the grammarian quoted to me; </li>
</ol>
<p>He recited God’s book at the beginning of the night <br/>
And at the end of it death claimed him. </p>
<p>and also: </p>
<p>He recited God’s book at night alone <br/>
As David recited the psalms at his ease. </p>
<p>The singular of amdni is umniya; amdni can also mean a man’s desire for <br/>
wealth and other things. [There is no real distinction between reading and <br/>
reciting. Right down to the Middle Ages it w ; as a matter of surprise if a <br/>
man was able to read a text without forming the words with his lips and so <br/>
reciting it.] </p>

<li>Safaka means ‘pour out’. The Arabs say ‘he shed his blood’ and ‘he <br/>
poured out wine’. The poet says: </li>
</ol>
<p>Whenever a guest comes into our land </p>
<p>We shed the blood of the victims in the dusty earth. </p>
<p>By fyal is meant clay mingled with sand which the Arabs call sahla. The <br/>
word occurs in a hadith : when Pharaoh said ‘I believe that there is no God <br/>
but He in whom the children of Israel believe’ Gabriel took some river mud <br/>
and slime and threw it in his face. Hal is like ham a. </p>

<p>Like the cry of the woman in travail whom the midwife helps. </p>
<p>[This line has been quoted on W. 199, q.v.] Yassaratha means ‘made <br/>
her sit down to bring forth’. </p>
<ol>
<li>Shafun means ‘shoots’, singular shafatun. The Arabs say qad ashfa'a <br/>
al-zaru, ‘the seed has sprouted’ when it has put forth its shoots. Azara <br/>
means ‘strengthened’. That which preceded it is like mothers. [Because he <br/>
has explained ‘shoots’ by firakh which could mean ‘chicks’.] Imru’ul-Qays <br/>
b. Hujr al-Kindl said: </li>

<p>Suq without hamza is plural of saq, the stem of a plant. </p>
<ol>
<li>Sazvaun means the middle (of the path), as in the lines of Hassan b. <br/>
Thabit: </li>
</ol>
<p>Alas for the prophet’s helpers and family <br/>
After he was concealed in the middle of the grave! </p>
<ol>
<li>Shatra means ‘towards’. 'Amr b. Ahmar al-Bahill (Bahila was the son <br/>
of Ya r sur b. Sa'd b. Qays b. 'Aylan) describing his camel, said: </li>
</ol>
<p>She takes us towards Jam' tucking her tail between her legs, </p>
<p>Her tail nearly reaches her girth. </p>
<p>Qays b. Khuwaylid al-Hudhali, also describing his camel, said: </p>
<p>The sluggish ( v.l. untrained) camel has an all-pervading disease <br/>
One looks at her with a tired eye. </p>
<p>Na'us is his camel; she had a disease and he looked at her with a tired eye <br/>
The word occurs in Sura 67. 4. </p>
<ol>
<li>Rabbdmyun are the learned, the lawyers, and the chiefs. The singular <br/>
is rabbdnl. A poet said: </li>
</ol>
<p>Were I living as a monk in a cell </p>
<p>Her voice would have enticed me forth and the most learned of them <br/>
too! </p>
<p>1 Lane, 52 b, c, indicates that ‘engirdled’ is a possible meaning. </p>
<p>I bn Hisham's Notes </p>

<p>Qus means a monk’s cell; aftanani is the dialect of Tamfm, fatanani being <br/>
the dialect of Qays. Jarir said: </p>
<p>There’s no union when Hind departs. Had she stayed </p>
<p>She would have entertained me and the cassocked one within his cell. </p>
<p>i.e. the monk’s cell. Rabbdni is derived from rabb which means ‘master’. <br/>
In God s book you find ‘He gave his master wine to drink’ (12. 41), -where <br/>
rabb means ‘master’. </p>
<ol>
<li>Abu Qays b. al-Aslat said: </li>
</ol>
<p>I was pained at the loss of a doughty defender. </p>
<p>A permanent grief afflicted me. </p>
<p>Though you killed him, a </p>
<p>Sharp sword has bitten into 'Amr’s head. </p>
<p>The story of Bu ath is too long to go into here for the reasons which I have <br/>
given above. Sanln is the same as masnun from sannahu, ‘he sharpened it’. </p>
<p>^e ana of the night are the hours, the singular being inyun. Al- <br/>
Mutanakhkhil al-Hudhali whose name was Malik b. 'Uwaymir said be¬ <br/>
wailing the loss of his son Uthayla: </p>
<p>Sweet and bitter was his nature like the shuffling of gaming arrows. </p>
<p>At any hour the night demanded he stood ready shod. </p>
<p>Labid b. Rabfa describing a wild ass said: </p>
<p>Throughout the day he is as excited as though he were a misguided <br/>
fellow </p>
<p>Whom a boon-companion had given wine among the wine sellers. </p>
<p>According to what Yunus told me you can say inan with alif maqsura. <br/>
[S. points out that inan is used in the Quran.] </p>
<p>3 I 9 - means to rub off and make level so that eye, nose, mouth, and </p>
<p>everything that made up the face is no more to be seen; similarly ‘We <br/>
blotted out their eyes’ (Sura 54. 37), the effaced of eye with no gap between <br/>
his eyelids; and you can say ‘t erased the writing and the mark’ so that nothing <br/>
can be seen of it. Al-Akh^al whose name was al-Ghauth b. Hubayra b. <br/>
al-§alt al-Taghlibi, describing a camel he had tried hardly, said: </p>
<p>We gave her the hard task of going to every distant well whose mark was <br/>
obliterated </p>
<p>Where you can see the chameleons writhing in the heat. (Akhtal 7. 5.) </p>
<p>Smva in the singular is stiwzva, which means a mark to indicate a road or a <br/>
waterhole. He says that it was rubbed off and made level with the ground so <br/>
that there was nothing showing above the soil. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>al-Jibt among the Arabs means whatever is worshipped other than <br/>
God. faghut means everything that leads away from the truth; plural <br/>
jubut and fawdghit. I was told that Abu Najlh said that jibt means sorcery <br/>
and faghut Satan. </p>

<li>Ayydna means ‘when’, as in the line of Qays b. al-Hudadlya al- <br/>
Khuza'i: </li>
</ol>
<p>With a secret that we shared I came </p>
<p>To ask her when he who was away would return. </p>
<p>Mursaha means ‘end’ and the plural is mardsin. Al-Kumayt b. Zayd al- <br/>
Asadl said: </p>
<p>And those who found the door w'hich others missed <br/>
The haven of the principles of Islam. ( Agh . xv. 123. 26.) </p>
<p>The mursa of a ship is where it comes to rest. Hafiyun 'anhd comes in a <br/>
sentence in which the order is inverted. He says: ‘They will ask you about it <br/>
as though you would favour them,’ i.e. tell them what you will not tell any¬ <br/>
one else. Al-liafiy means ‘the kind, the considerate’, and in God’s book <br/>
‘Verily He is gracious to me’ (19. 48). The plural is ahfiya. A'sha of B. <br/>
Qays b. Tha'laba said: </p>
<p>If you ask about me, many a one asks about A'sha, </p>
<p>Where has he gone ? Good friends that they are. </p>
<p>Hafiy also means al-mustahfi, the one who exceeds all bounds in asking <br/>
questions. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Yudahuna means they imitate their speech, the speech of the infidels. <br/>
If you say something and someone says the same thing he copies ( yuddhi ) <br/>
you. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>%ahir means ‘help’. The Arabs say tazaharu 'alayhi, i.e. they helped <br/>
one another against him. The poet said: </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>O namesake of the prophet, you were a support to religion <br/>
And a help to the imam. </p>
<p>The plural is zuhara ’. </p>
<ol>
<li>al-samad means one on whom one depends and in whom one takes <br/>
refuge. Hind d. Ma'bad b. Nadia mourning 'Amr b. Mas'ud and Khalid <br/>
b. Nadia her two uncles the Asadites (they were killed by al-Nu'man b. <br/>
al-Mundhir al-Lakhmi and he built the two standing stones which are in <br/>
Kufa over them) said: </li>
</ol>
<p>One came early to tell me of the death of the two best of Asad, </p>
<p>'Amr b. Mas'ud and the dependable chief {al-samad), </p>
<p>[The meaning of this word is most obscure and commentators on the <br/>
Quran differ widely. The Ghariyan were two standing stones which were <br/>
smeared with the blood of the victims sacrificed there. See W. R. Smith, <br/>
RS. 157, 201, 210 and the literature cited there. For the present-day <br/>
survival of the rite see Frey a Stark, A Winter in Arabia, London, 1940, 153.] </p>

<p>He means the polisher who bends over his work. Nuqab means ‘rust’ on a <br/>
sword; yajtali means polishing a sword. Salm also means ‘peace’, and in <br/>
the book of God ‘Be not weak and call to peace when you have the upper <br/>
hand’. 1 It is also read as silm with the same meaning. Zuhayr b. Abu Sulma <br/>
said: </p>
<p>You said if we can possibly attain peace <br/>
By money and good words we will make peace. 2 </p>
<p>I was told that al-Hasan b. Abu’l-Hasan al-Basri said that ‘and if they incline <br/>
to salm' meant Islam; and in the book of God ‘O you who believe enter into <br/>
silm all of you’ can be read as ‘into salm' which is Islam. Umayya b. Abu’l- <br/>

fact that when a disaster befell you you had brought twice as great a disaster on <br/>
them’; this He said in reference to those who took part in the battle of Badr. <br/>
Those of them who were martyred number 70 men. He says: ‘You brought <br/>
disaster at Badr on twice as many as you lost as martyrs at Uhud, 70 dead <br/>
and 70 prisoners.’ Abu Zayd al-Ansari quoted to me the line of Ka'b b. <br/>

concerned with 'Abbas’s orthodoxy; but we may be confident that political reasons and <br/>
concern for personal safety led to the excision of the name of the ancestor of the new dynasty. <br/>
It is perfectly clear that 1.1. originally wrote his name and put the total at the end of the <br/>
section ‘3 men’. Every other clan contains the names and the total numbers of its men <br/>
taken prisoner except the clan of Hashim. Whether he himself struck out the offending <br/>
words when he gave his copy to the caliph al-Man$ur, or whether a later copyist did so, is <br/>
unimportant. Clearly the change came about when the sons of 'Abbas replaced the sons of <br/>
Umayya. »• </p>

goods and sold them in the market of the B. Qaynuqa'. She sat down by a <br/>
goldsmith, and the people tried to get her to uncover her face but she refused. <br/>
The goldsmith took hold of the end of her skirt and fastened it to her back <br/>
so when she got up she was immodestly exposed, and they laughed at her. <br/>
She uttered a loud cry and one of the Muslims leapt upon the goldsmith and <br/>
killed him. He was a Jew, and the Jews fell upon the Muslim and killed him, <br/>
whereupon the Muslim’s family called on the Muslims for help against the <br/>
Jews. The Muslims were enraged, and bad feeling sprang up between the <br/>
two parties.’ </p>

<p>Abu 'Ubayda told me on the authority of Abu 'Amr, the Medinan, <br/>
when the apostle got the better of the B. Qurayza he seized about four <br/>
hundred men from the Jew's w r ho had been allies of Aus against Khazraj, <br/>
and ordered that they should be beheaded. Accordingly Khazraj began to <br/>
cut off their heads with great satisfaction. The apostle saw r that the faces of <br/>
Khazraj showed their pleasure, but there was no such indication on the part of <br/>
Aus, and he suspected that that w'as because of the alliance that had existed <br/>
between them and the B. Qurayza. When there w : ere only twelve of them <br/>
left he gave them over to Aus, assigning one Jew to every two of Aus, saying, <br/>
‘Let so-and-so strike him and so-and-so finish him off.’ One of those w r ho <br/>
was so handed over to them w'as Ka'b b. Yahudha, who w r as an important <br/>
man among them. He gave him to Muhayyisa and Abu Burda b. Niyar <br/>
(it W'as Abu Burda to whom the apostle had given permission to sacrifice <br/>
a young goat on the feast of Adha). He said, ‘Let Muhayyisa strike him and <br/>
Abu Burda finish him off.’ So Muhayyisa fetched him a blow, which did not <br/>
cut in properly, and Abu Burda dispatched him and gave him the finishing <br/>
stroke. Huwayyisa, who w r as still an unbeliever, said to his brother, Muhay¬ <br/>
yisa, ‘Did you kill Ka'b b. Yahudha?’, and when he said he did, he said, <br/>
‘By God, much of the flesh on your belly comes from his wealth; you are a <br/>
miserable fellow, Muhayyisa.’ He replied, ‘If the one who ordered me to <br/>
kill him had ordered me to kill you, I w'ould have done so.’ He w r as amazed <br/>
at this remark and went aw'ay astounded. They say that he used to wake up <br/>
in the night astonished at his brother’s words, until in the morning he said, <br/>
‘By God, this is indeed a religion.’ Then he came to the prophet and accepted <br/>
Islam. Muhayyisa then spoke the lines which we have written above. </p>

<p>Others say Ruqayya. </p>

<p>A traditionist told me that the apostle said: ‘I saw' some cows of mine <br/>
being slaughtered; they are those of my companions who will be killed. <br/>
As to the dent W'hich I saw in my sw'ord, that is one of my family who will <br/>

<p>The apostle allowed Samura b. J undub al-Fazarl and Rafi' b. Khadlj <br/>
brother of B. Haritha to go to battle, although they were but fifteen years of <br/>
age and he had sent them back at first. But he was told that Rafi' w r as a <br/>
good archer so he let him go, and after having given him permission he was <br/>
told that Samura could throw Rafi' in wrestling so he let him go too. The <br/>
following he turned back: Usama b. Zayd; 'Abdullah b. 'Umar b. al-Khaftab; <br/>
Zayd b. Thabit, one of B. Malik b. al-Najjar; al-Bara’ b. 'Azib, one of B. <br/>
Haritha; 'Amr b. Hazm, one of B. Malik b. al-Najjar; Usayd b. £uhayr, one <br/>
of B. Haritha. He let them fight at the Trench w'hen they w'ere fifteen <br/>
years of age. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The companions’ war-cry that day was ‘Kill, Kill!’ </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More than one traditionist has told me that Al-Zubayr b. al-'Aw'wam <br/>
said, ‘I was annoyed when I asked the apostle for the sword and he refused <br/>
me and gave it to Abu Dujana. I thought, “I am the son of $aflya, his <br/>
aunt, and belong to Quraysh, and I went and asked him for it before this <br/>
man, yet he gave it to him and left me. By God, I will see what he is doing.” <br/>
So I followed him. The man drew out his red turban and wrapped his head <br/>
in it. The Ansar said, ‘‘Abu Dujana has donned the turban of death.” <br/>
This is w'hat they used to say w'hen he put it on. As he went forth he was <br/>
saying, </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Among the palms of that mountain side, </p>
<p>In solemn w'ords my comrade cried, </p>
<p>Behind the ranks I’ll never bide, </p>

<p>I have heard that Wahshf was always being punished for drinking <br/>
wine until he was struck off the pension list. 'Umar used to say: ‘I knew <br/>
that God would not leave the slayer of Hamza unpunished.’ </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maslama b. 'Alqama al-Mazinl told me: When the fighting w'as fierce <br/>
on the day of Uhud the apostle sat under the flag of the Ansar and sent a <br/>
message to ‘All to tell him to bring the flag forward, which he did, saying, <br/>
‘I am Abu’l-Qusam’ or ‘Abu’l-Fusam’ according to I.H. Abu Sa’d b. Abfl <br/>
Talha, who was in charge of the standard of the polytheists, called to him, <br/>
‘Would you like to meet my challenge, Abu’l-Qusam?’ When 'All accepted <br/>
the challenge they fought between the ranks and exchanged two blow's until <br/>
'All smote him and laid him on the ground. Then he left him without dis¬ <br/>
patching him. When his companions asked why he did not finish him off he <br/>
said: ‘He exposed his person to me (as a sign of abject surrender) and the <br/>
tie of kindred made me pity him and I knew that God would certainly <br/>
kill him.’ </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is said that Abu Sa’d w r ent out between the ranks and cried, ‘I will <br/>
break in pieces anyone who fights me,’ and none went out against him. <br/>
Then he cried: ‘O you companions of Muhammad, you allege that your </p>

<p>754 TAe Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>dead are in paradise and our dead are in hell. By al-Lat you lie. If you <br/>
knew that was true one of you would come out to me.’ So 'All went forth <br/>
and after exchanging a couple of blows 'All smote him and killed him. </p>
<ol>
<li>Some say that he heard a cry for help. You find this expression in the <br/>
hadith: ‘The best man is he who takes hold of his horse’s bridle: whenever <br/>
he hears a cry of fear he flies towards it.’ Al-Tirimmah b. Hakim al-Xa’Iy <br/>
(^irimmah means ‘a tall man’) said: </li>

Whenever the timorous cry for help. </p>
<ol>
<li>yassan b. Thabit, according to Ibn Hisham, answered him thus: </li>
</ol>
<p>You mention the proud stallions of Hashim’s line <br/>
And there you lie not but speak the truth. </p>
<p>Are you pleased that you killed Hamza <br/>
The noble one whom you yourself call noble ? </p>
<p>Did they not kill 'Amr and 'Utba <br/>

<p>The words ‘or jackals’ do not come from 1 . 1 . [This is an interesting <br/>
note from I.H., because it indicates that he know r s that the text of the poem <br/>

from Tab. 1414 which reads: ‘hyaenas and jackals w r ould have crunched his <br/>
bones’, with farfarat for qarqarat. The alteration consists of one dot; but <br/>
one would have expected that I.H., knowing the true text, would have <br/>

<p>al-Harith answered Abu Sufyan thus because he suspected that he <br/>

that day and broke his right lower incisor and wounded his lower lip, and <br/>
that 'Abdullah b. Shihab al-Zuhrl wounded him in the forehehd, and that <br/>
Ibn Qami’a wounded his cheekbone. Two rings from his helmet were <br/>
forced into his cheek, and the apostle fell in a hole which Abu 'Amir had <br/>
made so that the Muslims might fall into it unawares. 'All took hold of the <br/>
apostle’s hand and Talha b. 'Ubaydullah lifted him until he stood upright. <br/>
Malik b. Sinan, the father of Abu Sa'Id al-Khudri, sucked the blood from <br/>
the apostle’s face. Then he swallowed it. The apostle said, ‘He whose blood <br/>
mingles with mine will not be touched by the fire of hell.’ 'Abdu’l-'AzIz b. <br/>

story,” and she answered: ‘‘I went out at the beginning of the day to see <br/>
what the men were doing, carrying a skin with water in it, and I came up to <br/>
the apostle who was with his companions while the battle was in their favour <br/>
When the Moslems were defeated, I betook myself to the apostle and stood <br/>
up joining in the fight and protecting him with my sword and shooting with <br/>
my bow until I suffered many wounds.” ’ Umm Sa'd said, ‘I saw on her <br/>
shoulder a deep gash and asked who was responsible for it. She said ‘‘Ibn <br/>
Qami’a, God curse him! When the men fell back from the apostle he came <br/>
forward saying ‘Lead me to Muhammad; let me not survive if he does.’ <br/>
Mus ab b. Umayr and I and some men who held their ground w'ith the <br/>
apostle blocked his path. It was he w'ho gave me this wound, but I struck <br/>
him several times for that. However, the enemy of God was wearing two <br/>

<p>^ trad ^ omst In whom I have confidence told me that al-Harith killed <br/>
al-Mujadhdhar but did not kill Qays. An indication of the same fact is that <br/>
Ibn Ishaq does not mention him among those w r ho wore slain at Uhud. The <br/>
reason that he killed al-Mujadhdhar was because he had killed his father <br/>
buwayd in one of the skirmishes between Aus and Khazraj. We have <br/>
mentioned that m an earlier passage of this book. While the apostle was with <br/>
a number of his companions, suddenly al-Harith appeared from one of the <br/>
gardens of Medina wearing two blood-stained garments. The apostle </p>

was present at Badr and found martyrdom at Uhud.’ </p>

<p>When the apostle stood over Hamza’s body he said, ‘I have never <br/>
been so hurt before. Never have I been more angry.’ Then he said: <br/>
‘Gabriel came to me and told me that Hamza was written among the people <br/>
of the seven heavens: “Hamza b. r Abdu 1 -Muttalib, the lion of God and the <br/>
lion of his apostle.’’ ’ The apostle and Hamza and Abu Salamab. Abdu 1 -Asad <br/>
were foster-brothers whom a freedwoman of Abu Lahab had fostered. </p>

<li>
<p>On that day he forbade lamentation. Abu Ubayda told me that w T hen <br/>

to go away.’ (I read 'atamat with C. for W.’s 'alimtu or ' alimta .) </p>

are infuriated and we fear that they may fight as they did not fight before; so <br/>
return,’ and they did return. When the prophet who was in Hamra’u’l-Asad <br/>
heard that they had decided to return he said: ‘Stones have been marked for <br/>
them. 1 Had they been pelted with them that morning they would have been <br/>
like yesterday that is past.’ </p>
<p>Abu ’Ubayda said: ‘On that journey of his before he returned to Medina, <br/>
the apostle seized Mu'awiya b. al-Mughlra, who was the grandfather of <br/>
'Abdu’l-Malik b. Marwan, the father of his mother 'A’isha, and Abu 'Azza <br/>
al-Jumahi. The apostle had taken him prisoner at Badr and then released <br/>
him. He asked the apostle to forgive him, but he said “You shall not stroke <br/>
your cheeks in Mecca after this and say‘I have deceived Muhammad twice.’ <br/>
Strike off his head, Zubayr,” and he did so.’ </p>
<p>I have heard that Sa'id b. al-Musayyab said that the apostle said to him: <br/>
‘The believer should not be bitten twice by the same* snake. Cut off his <br/>
head, O 'Asim b. Thabit’, and he did so. </p>
<p>It is said Zayd b. Haritha and Ammar b. Yasir killed Mu'awiya b. al- <br/>
Mughlra after Hamra’u’l-Asad. He had taken refuge with 'Uthman b. <br/>
'Affan, who asked the apostle to give him sanctuary, and he did so on the <br/>
condition that if he were found after three days he should be killed. He <br/>
stayed there more than three days and hid himself. The prophet sent the <br/>
two of them and said, ‘You will find him in such-and-such a place.’ They <br/>
found him there and killed him. </p>
<ol>
<li>Tubawwi u means ‘you chose positions and sites for them.’ Al-Kumayt <br/>
b. Zayd said: </li>

<p>Would that I before him <br/>
Had chosen a place to sleep in. </p>

that we had not thought as we did because God took us in hand.’ </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Musawwamln means ‘plainly marked’. We have heard that al-Hasan <br/>
b. Abu’i-Hasan al-Basri said: ‘They had marked the tails and forelocks of <br/>
their horses with white wool.’ As for Ibn Ishaq he said: Their distinguishing <br/>
mark on the day of Badr was white turbans, which I have recorded in the <br/>
story of Badr. Sima means ‘distinguishing mark’. In the book of God you <br/>
read: ‘Their mark is on their faces (it is) the result of prostration’ (48. 29), <br/>
i.e. their distinguishing mark. ‘And stones of clay massed, marked’ (11. 84), <br/>
i.e. ‘plainly marked’. We have heard that al-Hasan said ‘A mark upon <br/>
them? It was not a mark of the stones of this world, but of the stones of <br/>
punishment’. Ru’ba b. al-'Ajjaj said: </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Proud steeds now' meet their match in me. </p>
<p>They cannot keep up with me though marked out (as the finest). </p>
<p>Their eyes look up helplessly as they gallop full speed, </p>
<p>Ajdkamu with dhdl means ‘run fast’ and ajdamu with dal means ‘give up’. <br/>
These verses occur in a rajaz poem of his. Musazvzvama also means ‘at <br/>
pasture’; and in the book of God ‘and horses at pasture’ (3. 12) and ‘trees </p>
<p>1 i.e. stones had been ‘earmarked’ for them. </p>

<p>on which you send beasts to pasture* (16. 10). The Arabs say sawwama and <br/>
asdma when a man pastures his horses and camels. Al-Kumayt said: </p>
<p>He was a gentle shepherd and we lost him. </p>
<p>The loss of the pastor is the loss of the pastured. </p>
<p>The word musjih means ‘gently leading, kind to the flock*. </p>

<li>Yakbitahum means ‘afflict them to the utmost and prevent them from <br/>
attaining their desires’. Dhu’l-Rumma said: </li>
</ol>
<p>While I forget past sorrow I shall not forget our perplexity. </p>
<p>Poised between pleasure and frustration. </p>
<p>The word also means ‘that he may throw them on their faces’. </p>

<li>Ribbtyun, singular ribbi, and al-ribab is applied to the sons of ‘Abdu <br/>
Manat b. Udd b. Tabikha b. Ilyas and to Dabba because they gathered <br/>
together and made alliances; by this they mean multitudes. Singular of <br/>
ribab is ribba and ribdba w r hich mean large numbers of sticks and arrows and <br/>
such-like and they compare them to them. Umayya b. Abu’l-§alt said: </li>
</ol>
<p>Round their leaders are swarms, myriads, </p>
<p>Clad in nailed armour. </p>
<p>Ribdba also means the cloth in which arrows are wrapped. Sanawwar means <br/>
armour, and dusur are the nails in coats of mail. God says: ‘We carried him <br/>
on a thing of planks and nails’ (54. 13). Abu’l-Akhzar al-Himmani of <br/>
Tamim said: </p>
<p>Nails on the ends of a straightened shaft. </p>
<ol>
<li>Hass means rooting out. You can say hasastu something when you <br/>
exterminate it by the sword or such-like. Jarir said: </li>
</ol>
<p>The swords exterminated them as when <br/>
A flame rose high among felled trees. </p>

credited to Janub sister of 'Amr Dhu’l-Kalb al-Hudhali in some verses <br/>
of hers about some other fight. [Cf. Diivan der Hudhailiten , ed. Kosegarten, <br/>
p. 243.] </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ka'b had said, ‘Our fighting is on behalf of our stock,’ and the apostle <br/>
asked, ‘Would it do to say our fighting is on behalf of our religion ?’ Ka'b <br/>
said ‘Yes,’ and the apostle said: ‘Then it is better,’ and so Ka'b phrased it <br/>
thus. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abu Zayd quoted me the words ‘an example to be talked of’ and the <br/>
verses preceding and the words ‘Among Quraysh’, &amp;c., as from a source <br/>
other than 1.1. </p>

(For they have true news of us today) </p>
<p>That we were steadfast while death’s standards fluttered <br/>
That morn on the floor of Yathrib’s valley. </p>
<p>We stood firm against them, for steadfastness is our nature: </p>
<p>When poltroons flee we rise to the occasion. </p>
<p>’Tis our wont to go forward firmly. </p>
<p>Of old w r e did so and gained the first place. </p>

death may overtake me before the morning and it may not be recited in my <br/>
name.’ </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Abu 'Ubayda quoted to me the verse of al-Hajjaj b. 'Ilat al-Sulami in <br/>
praise of 'All in which he mentioned his killing Talha b. Abu Talha b. <br/>
'Abdu’l-'Uzza, the standard-bearer of the polytheists, on the day of Uhud: </p>
<p>By God, what a fine protector of women is Fatima’s son <br/>
Whose paternal and maternal uncles were noble! </p>
<p>You quickly dealt him a deadly thrust </p>
<p>Which left Talha with his forehead cleaving to the dust; </p>
<p>You attacked them like a hero and made them retreat <br/>
At the mountain foot, where they fell one after another. </p>

<p>Abu Zayd quoted to me the verse ‘How we behave’ and the next <br/>

A doughty adversary, great in argument. </p>
<p>Others report ‘with an argument that silences his opponents’. <br/>
mighl&amp;q here means alandad as in the line of al- r {’irimmah b. Hakim describ¬ <br/>

<p>He were an adversary who had overcome his contumacious rivals. <br/>

Before I sold him. </p>

next to them prostrated themselves. Then the front rank went back and the <br/>

God will forgive them: God is forgiving, merciful’ (9. 103). </p>

will conquer their fort.’ They said, ‘O Muhammad, we will submit to the <br/>
judgement of Sa'd b. Mu'adh.’ </p>

<li>
<p>fuqqahiya means a kind of brocade. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This was the woman who threw the millstone on Khallad b. Suwayd <br/>
and killed him. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Qabla is the receiving of the bucket of the camel drawing w 7 ater. <br/>
Zuhayr b. Abu Sulma said concerning qabla : </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Whenever his hands get hold of the bottom of the bucket <br/>
He sings as he stands pouring out the water. </p>
<p>Another reading is waqabilin yatalaqqd, meaning ‘the receiver of the bucket <br/>
takes hold of it’. The nadih is the camel that draws the water to irrigate. <br/>
Cf. Shark Diwan Zuhayr , Cairo, 1944, p. 40. [Here I.H. is explaining the <br/>
variant qabla for fatla.] </p>
<ol>
<li>Aqtar means ‘sides’, singular qitr. Qatr , plural aqtdr, has the same <br/>
meaning. Al-Farazdaq said: </li>
</ol>
<p>What wealth did God open to them <br/>
As the horses rolled on their sides </p>
<p>[i.e. to get to their feet]. Aqtdr and aqtar are variant readings. </p>
<ol>
<li>Salaqukum means ‘they injured you with talk, burned and distressed <br/>
you’. The Beduin say ‘an eloquent ( salldq) speaker and khatib mislaq and <br/>
misldq.' A‘sha of B. Qays b. Tha'laba said: </li>
</ol>
<p>Among them is glory, tolerance, and nobility, </p>
<p>Among them is the sharp eloquent orator. </p>
<ol>
<li>Qadd nahbahu means ‘died’; nahb means ‘breath’, according to what <br/>
Abu ‘Ubayda told me; its plural is nuhub. Dhu’l-Rumma said: </li>
</ol>
<p>The night that the Idarithis fled </p>
<p>After Haubar died (qadd nahbahu) in the cavalry charge. </p>
<p>Haubar was one of B. al-Harith b. Ka‘b. He means Yazid b. Haubar. Nahb <br/>
also means ‘vow’. Jarir b. al-Khatafl said: </p>
<p>In Tikhfa we fought the kings, and our cavalry <br/>
Went on the night of Bistam to fulfil their vow. </p>
<p>He means the vow they had sworn to kill him and they did kill him. Bist&amp;m <br/>
was Bisfam b. Qays b. Mas‘ud al-Shaybanl, who was Ibn Dhu’l-Jaddayn. <br/>
Abu 'Ubayda told me that he was the knight of Rabf a b. Nizar. Tikhfa is a <br/>
place on the Basra road. Nahb also means ‘wagers’, i.e. ‘bets’. Al-Farazdaq <br/>
said </p>
<p>When Kalb bet against people which of us <br/>
Is more generous and liberal ? </p>
<p>I bn His ham’s Notes </p>
<p>766 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Another meaning is ‘weeping’. Nahb also means ‘necessity and need’. You <br/>
can say ‘They have nothing I want.’ Malik b. Buwayra al-Yarbu'i said: </p>
<p>They have nothing I want except that I </p>
<p>Seek the red-eyed camels of Shudun that you want. </p>
<p>Nahar b. Tausi'a, one of B. Taymu’l-Lat b. Tha'laba b. 'Ukaba b. E?a'b b. <br/>
'All b. Bakr b. Wa’il, who were clients of B. Hanifa, said: </p>
<p>A long gallop saved Yusuf al-Thaqafi <br/>
After the standard had fallen. </p>
<p>Had they overtaken him they would have fulfilled their need of him. <br/>
There is a protector for every (victim) missed. </p>
<p>Nahb also means ‘a gentle rapid gait’. </p>
<ol>
<li>Suhaym slave of B. al-Hashas who are of B. Asad b. Khuzayma said: </li>
</ol>
<p>The chiefs 1 lay dead on the ground <br/>
And Tamim’s women hastened to the forts. </p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(aya\)</span>i also means ‘horns’. AI-Nabigha al-Ja'di said: </p>
<p>(Death smote the) chiefs of my tribe so that I was alone <br/>
Like the horn of a bull whose other horn is broken off. </p>
<p>Abu Duwad al-Iyadi said: </p>
<p>The blackness of their horns scared us. </p>
<p>Their feet as it were sprinkled with pitch and tar. </p>
<p>$ayd§i also means the weaver’s implement according to what Abu 'Ubayda <br/>
told me, and he quoted me the line of Durayd b. al-§imma al-Jushaml, <br/>
Jusham b. Mu'awiya b. Bakr b. Hawazin: </p>
<p>I looked at him as the spears 2 went through him <br/>
As the sayasi go through the outstretched web. </p>
<p>§ayasi also means the protuberances on the feet of cocks like little horns. <br/>
It also means Toots’. He told me that the Arabs say, ‘May God cut off his <br/>
ftfiya, i.e. his root’. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The metaphorical meaning of this tradition is (explained in) the words <br/>
of 'Aisha: ‘The apostle said, The grave has a hold on people; if anyone were <br/>
to escape from it it would be Sa'd b. Mu'adh.* </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She was Kubaysha d. Rafi' b. Mu'awiya b. 'Ubayd b. Tha'laba b. <br/>
'Abdu* 1 -Abjar, who was Khudra b. 'Auf b. al-Harith b. al-Khazraj. </p>

<li>
<p>You can say sahmu gharbin and sahmun gharbun with or without ufifa. <br/>
It is not known whence the arrow comes or who shot it. </p>

<p>He was 'Uthman b. Umayya b. Munabbih b. 'Ubayd b. al-Sabbaq. </p>

<li>
<p>I have heard from al-Zuhrl that they gave 3 the apostle 10,000 dirhams <br/>
for his body. </p>

</ol>
<p>1 The poet is speaking of mountain goats. </p>
<p>2 W.’s tval-rthu makes no sense and violates the metre. It is one of his very few mistakes. </p>
<p>3 Perhaps the sense here is merely ‘they offered to give’. </p>
<p>767 </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A trustworthy person told me that he was told on the authority of <br/>
al-Zuhrl that that day 'All killed 'Amr b. 'Abdu Wudd and his son Hisl. <br/>
Others say 'Amr b. 'Abd. [Presumably the name of the heathen deity has <br/>
been dropped.] </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One whom I can trust told me from 'Abdu’l-Malik b. Yahya b. 'Abbad <br/>
b. 'Abdullah b. al-Zubayr: When Ka'b said, ‘Quraysh came to contend with <br/>
their Lord’, &amp;c., the apostle said: ‘God thanks you, Ka'b, for saying that.’ </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abu Zayd quoted to me verses 8 and 20; and v. 11 with the variant <br/>
‘as though to the top of Quds al-Mashriq’. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The verses ‘We kept every fine . . . courser’ and the following verse <br/>
and the third and fourth and the verse ‘Haughty as an angry lion’ and the <br/>
following verse are from Abu Zayd. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some authorities on poetry deny his authorship. The words "Amr to <br/>
dismount’ are not from I, I. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some authorities on poetry deny Hassan’s authorship. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These verses are credited to Rabfa b. Umaya al-DllI, whose last verse <br/>
runs: </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You brought the KhazrajI to his knees <br/>
And so I saw my desire on him. </p>
<p>The verses are also credited to Abu Usama al-Jushaml. </p>

<p>Sa'd’s horse was Lahiq; Miqdad’s was Ba'zaja or Sabha; 'Ukasha’s was <br/>

<p>He left I. Umm Maktum in charge of Medina. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>73 5• When Hassan said this Sa'd b. Zayd was enraged against him and swore <br/>
that he would never speak to him again. He said: ‘He has actually attributed <br/>
my horses and my horsemen to al-Miqdad!’ Hassan excused himself, saying, <br/>
‘That was not my intention, I swear. But al-Miqdad’s name suited the <br/>
rhyme’. Hassan composed other verses to placate Sa'd: </p>
<p>If you seek the stoutest warrior <br/>
Or an able man, go to Sa'd, </p>
<p>Sa'd b. Zayd the dauntless. </p>
<p>But Sa'd would not accept the apology and it availed him naught. </p>
<ol>
<li>Abu Zayd quoted me the line ‘We feed the guest’. </li>
</ol>
<p>768 The Life of Muhammad </p>

<li>
<p>He put Abu Dharr al-Ghifari or Numayla b. 'Abdullah al-Laythi in <br/>
charge of Medina. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The war-cry of the Muslims on the day of B. Mu§taliq was ‘0 victorious <br/>
one, slay, slay!’ </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is said that when the apostle departed from the raid with Juwayriya <br/>
and was at Dhatu’l-Jaysh he entrusted her to one of the Ansar and went <br/>
forward to Medina. Her father al-Harith came bringing his daughter’s <br/>
ransom. When he was in al-'Aqlq he looked at the camels he had brought as <br/>
her ransom and admired two of them greatly, so he hid them in one of the <br/>
passes of al-'Aqiq. Then he came to the prophet and told him that he had <br/>
brought his daughter’s ransom. He said: ‘Where are the two camels which <br/>
you have hidden in al-'Aqlq in such-and-such a pass?’ Al-Idarith exclaimed: <br/>
‘I bear witness that there is no God but Allah and that you, Muhammad, are <br/>
the apostle of Allah; for none could have known of this but God.’ He and <br/>
his two sons who were with him and some of his men accepted Islam and he <br/>
sent for the two camels and brought them and handed all of them over to the <br/>
prophet. His daughter was handed over to him and became an excellent <br/>
Muslim. The apostle asked her father to let him marry her and when he <br/>
agreed he gave her 400 dirhams as dowry. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She was Umm Ruman, Zaynab d. 'Abdu Duhman, one of B. Firas b. <br/>
Ghanam b. Malik b. Kinana. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Others say it was 'Abdullah b. Ubayy and his companions. The one <br/>
who had the greater share therein was 'Abdullah, as I.I. has shown above. <br/>
[Presumably I.H.’s note ends at this point.] </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the tradition kibrahu and kubrahu occur, but the Quran has kibrahu <br/>
with kasr. ‘Let not those who possess dignity among you.’ yd tali means ‘be <br/>
remiss', as in the line of Imru’ul-Qays al-Kindl: </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Many a troublesome opponent have I repelled for love of you, </p>
<p>One who advised and reproved me without ceasing {mu tali) </p>
<p>{Mu'all. v. 41). It is said that the Quranic words mean ‘Let not those who <br/>
possess dignity take an oath’, which according to what we have heard is what <br/>
al-Hasan Abu’l-Hasan al-Basrl said. And in God’s book ‘Those who forswear <br/>
their wives’ ( yuluna ) is from aliya and aliya means an oath. Hassan b. <br/>
Thabit said: </p>
<p>I swear that no man is more careful than I <br/>
In swearing an oath true and free from falsehood. </p>
<p>I shall mention this verse, in its context later {v.i., W. p. 1026, 1. 2). The <br/>
meaning of an yu tu in this case is an la yutu; and in God’s book we read: <br/>
‘God makes it plain to you an tadillu, meaning an la tadillu; He holds back <br/>
the sky lest {an) it should fall on the earth, meaning an la.' I. Mufarrigh al- <br/>
Idimyarl said: </p>
<p>May I never frighten the camels at dawn. </p>
<p>May I not be called Yazld </p>
<p>If, fearing death, I make my shame public </p>
<p>While the fates watch me lest I should turn aside. </p>

in Ka‘b e b ed Malt said, according to Ibn Hisham on the authority of AbQ </p>
<p>We came down to Khaybar and its drinking places , </p>

<p>On the day of Khaybar the apostle decided which were Arab horses and <br/>
which were of mixed blood. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He was called “Ubayd al-Siham’ because he bought the shares. He was <br/>
'Ubayd b. Aus, one of B. Haritha b. al-Harith b. al-Khazraj b. r Amr b. Malik <br/>
b. Aus. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Loads refer to) wheat, barley, dates, and datestones, &amp;c. He distri¬ <br/>
buted them according to their needs. [This useful explanatory note from <br/>
I.H. is not in W.’s text and there is no mention of the reading in his critical <br/>
notes in vol. iii. C. notes that it is missing in W. but does not state what <br/>
manuscripts contain it. Datestones were pounded up and used for camel <br/>
food.] The need of B. 'Abdu’l-Muttalib was greater and so he gave them <br/>
more. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some say ‘Azza b. Malik and his brother Murran or Marwan b. Malik. <br/>
[This latter divergence obviously shows that the tradition rested on manu¬ <br/>
scripts which could not be read with certainty.] </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to Malik b. Anas he said Kabbir Kabbir! [There is no <br/>
difference in the meaning.] </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Or Aslam. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some say ‘to Qatadah </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The word khatar means ‘share’. You can say akhtara ll fuldn khafaran, <br/>
‘someone gave me a share’. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sufyan b. 'Uyayna from al-Ajlah from al-Sha r bI said that Ja'far b. <br/>
Abu Talib came to the apostle the day he conquered Khaybar. The apostle <br/>
kissed his forehead and taking hold of him said: ‘I don’t know which gives <br/>
me the greater pleasure—the conquest of Khaybar or the arrival of Ja'fard </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Others say her name was Humayna. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He put 'Uwayf b. al-Adbat al-DUl in charge of Medina. This is also <br/>
called the ‘Pilgrimage of Retaliation’ because they prevented him from pil¬ <br/>
grimage in Dhu’l-Qa r da in the holy month in A.H. 6; and the apostle retaliated <br/>
and entered Mecca in the very month in which they had shut him out, in <br/>
a.h. 7. We have heard that I. 'Abbas said: ‘God revealed concerning that, <br/>
“And forbidden things are subject to retaliation” ’ ( 2 . 190). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The words ‘We will fight you about its interpretation’ to the end of the <br/>
verses were spoken by r Ammar b. Yasir about another battle. The proof of <br/>
that is that I. Rawaha referred only to the polytheists. They did not believe <br/>
in the revelation and only those who did would fight for an interpretation .of <br/>
it. [S. says the occasion w T as the battle of Siffln, and this certainly gives point <br/>
to the verses which are to be found in the K. Siffln.] </p>

<p>She had entrusted her sister Umm al-Fadl with her affairs; she, being <br/>
married to al-'Abbas, confided the matter to him, and he married her to the <br/>
apostle in Mecca and gave her as dowry on the apostle’s behalf 400 dirhams. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God sent dowm to him—so Abu r Ubayda told me—‘God has fulfilled <br/>
the vision in reality to His apostle, “You shall enter the sacred mosque if God <br/>
will in safety with heads shaved and (hair) shorn, not fearing’’. He knows <br/>
what you do not know, and He has wrought besides that a victory near by’ <br/>
(48. 27), i.e. Khaybar. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some authorities on poetry quoted the verses to me thus: </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You are the apostle and he who is deprived of his gifts <br/>
And the sight of him has no real worth. </p>
<p>May God confirm the good things He gave you <br/>
Among the apostles, and the victory as they were helped. </p>
<p>I perceived goodness in you by a natural gift, </p>
<p>An intuition which is contrary to what they think of you, </p>
<p>meaning the polytheists. </p>
<ol>
<li>Another reading is: </li>
</ol>
<p>We urged on our horses from the thickets of Qurh. </p>
<p>[This is the reading of T. 1212, 1. 9 and Yaq. iv. 53, 1. 22, who says that <br/>
Qurh is in the Wadi’l-Qura. I.I.’s reading is given in Yaq. iv. 571.] The <br/>
words ‘We arranged their bridles’ are not from 1 . 1 . </p>

<p>Others say 'Ubada b. Malik. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A traditionist whom I trust told me that JaTar took the flag in his right <br/>
hand and it w'as cut off; then he held it in his left hand and that w'as cut off; <br/>
then he held it to his breast with his arms until he was slain. He was 33 <br/>
years old. For that God rewarded him with a pair of wings in Paradise with <br/>
which he flew whither he would. It is said' that a Greek gave him a blow <br/>
which cut him asunder. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another reading is 40 skins (mam a ). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The words I. al-Irash are not from 1 . 1 . The third verse is from Khallad <br/>
b. Qurra: others say Malik b. Rafila. </p>

<p>The poem is ascribed to Habib b. 'Abdullah al-A'lam al-Hudhall, and <br/>

<ol>
<li>Sufyan b. 'Uyayna mentioned that the apostle said to 'All, ‘I give you <br/>
only that which you have lost; not that which you will cause others to lose.’ </li>
</ol>
<p>A traditionist told me that the apostle entered the temple on the day of the <br/>
occupation, and saw the figures of angels and other beings and a picture of <br/>
Abraham with divining arrows in his hand. ‘God slay them,’ he said, ‘they <br/>
have pictured our shaykh as a man divining with arrows. What has Abraham <br/>
to do with such things ? “Abraham was not a Jew nor a Christian, but he was a <br/>
franif, a Muslim, and was not a polytheist” ' (3. 60). Then he gave orders that <br/>
all those pictures should be erased. [Azraqi, Mecca, 1352, 104 ult., records <br/>
a tradition that the picture of Jesus and Mary was retained by the prophet.] </p>
<p>He also told me that the apostle and Bilal entered the Ka'ba, and when the <br/>
former came out Bilal remained behind. Abdullah b. ‘Umar went in to him <br/>
and asked him where the apostle had prayed, but he did not ask how many <br/>
times. When Ibn 'Umar went into the temple he "walked straightforward until <br/>
there was a space of about three cubits between the wall and the door behind <br/>
him; then he w r ould pray, making for the place which Bilal had told him of. </p>
<p>He also said that when the apostle entered the Ka'ba in the year of the <br/>
conquest in company with Bilal he ordered him to call the people to prayer. <br/>
Now Abu Sufyan b. Harb and 'Attab b. Asld and al-Harith b. Hisham were <br/>
sitting in the courtyard of the Ka'ba. 'Attab b. Asld said, ‘God has honoured <br/>
Asid in not letting him hear this, for it w'ould have enraged him.’ Al-Harith <br/>
said, ‘-If I knew that he w r as right I would follow him.’ Abu Sufyan said, <br/>
‘I say nothing. If I were to speak the very stones would tell him of it.’ <br/>
Thereupon the prophet came out to them and said, ‘I know what you said,’ <br/>
and repeated their words. Al-Harith and 'Attab said, ‘We bear witness that <br/>
you are the apostle of God. There was none with us who could have known <br/>
this so that we could say that it was he who told you.’ </p>
<ol>
<li>I heard that the first man for whom the apostle paid the bloodwit was <br/>
Junaydib b. al-Akwa'. The B. Ka'b killed him and the apostle paid a hundred <br/>
she-camels for him. </li>
</ol>
<p>I heard from Yahya b. Sa'id that when the prophet entered Mecca he <br/>
stood on al-§afa praying to God. The Ansar were all round him and were <br/>
saying among themselves, ‘Do you think that now that God has given him <br/>
power over his land and his towm that he will remain in it?’ When he had <br/>
ended his prayers he asked them what they had been saying. At first they <br/>
would not say, but finally they told him and he said: ‘God forbid! The place <br/>
where I live will be your place, and the place where I die will be yours.’ </p>
<p>A traditionist in whom I have confidence with a chain going back to <br/>
Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri from 'Ubaydullah b. 'Abdullah from Ibn 'Abbas said: <br/>
The apostle entered Mecca on the day of conquest riding his camel, and went <br/>
round the Ka'ba on it. All round the temple were images set in lead, and the <br/>
apostle was pointing at them with a stick in his hand, saying, ‘Truth has <br/>
come and falsehood has passed away: falsehood is bound to pass away’ <br/>
(17. 82). If he pointed at the image’s face it fell backwards; if he pointed at <br/>
its back it fell on its face, until there was not one of them standing. Tamlm <br/>
b. Asad al-Khuza'i said concerning that: </p>
<p>In the idols there is an instructive lesson </p>
<p>To one who hopes for reward or punishment. </p>
<p>Ibn Hisham’s Notes 775 </p>
<p>He told me that Fadala b. 'Umayr b. al-Mulawwah al-Laythl wanted to <br/>
kill the prophet as he was going round the temple in the year of the conquest. <br/>
When he drew near, the apostle asked him what he was muttering. He replied <br/>
that he was only mentioning the name of God. The prophet laughed and <br/>
said, ‘Ask God’s forgiveness,’ and he put his hand on his chest and his heart <br/>
became at rest. Fadala used to say, ‘As soon as he took his hand from my <br/>
chest none of God’s creatures was dearer to me than he; so I w r ent back to <br/>
my people. I passed by a woman with whom I used to have converse, and <br/>
when she asked me to join her I refused.’ He used to say, </p>
<p>She said, Come and talk! and I said, </p>
<p>God and Islam make it unlawful. </p>
<p>If you had seen Muhammad and his victorious entry <br/>
The day the idols were smashed <br/>
You would have seen God’s religion shining plainly <br/>
And darlmess covering the face of idolatry. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A traditionist of Quraysh told me that Safwan said to 'Umayr, ‘Con¬ <br/>
found you, get away and do not speak to me, for you are a liar,’ because of <br/>
what he himself had done, We have mentioned the latter in the end of the <br/>
account of the battle of Badr. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some authorities on poetry deny his authorship of this poem. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another version is ‘And kinship’s cords were severed from you.’ </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hassan said this on the day of the occupation. For 'ayba some recite <br/>
'atba, Al-Zuhri is reported to have said: ‘When the apostle saw the women <br/>
flapping their veils at the horses he looked at Abu Bakr with a smile.’ </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is part of a longer ode of his. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'Abbas b. Mirdas al-Sulami said: </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With us on the day Muhammad entered Mecca </p>
<p>Were a thousand marked men 1 —the valleys flowed with them. </p>
<p>They had helped the apostle and been present at his battles, </p>
<p>Their mark on the day of battle being to the fore. </p>
<p>In a strait place their feet were firm. </p>
<p>They split the enemies’ heads like colocynths. </p>
<p>Their hooves had traversed Najd beforehand <br/>
Till at last black Hijaz became subject to them. </p>
<p>God gave him the mastery of it. </p>
<p>The judgment of the sword and victorious fortune subdued it to us. <br/>
One old in authority, proud in mien, </p>
<p>Seeking the bounds of glory, exceeding generous. </p>
<p>ABBAS B. MIRDAS BECOMES A MUSLIM </p>
<p>According to what an authority on poetry told me the father of 'Abbas had <br/>
an idol which he used to worship. It was a stone called Ipamari. One day </p>
<p>1 i.e. with a distinguishing turban or emblem; or the word might mean ‘released’ <br/>
‘let go’. </p>
<p>77 ^ The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Mirdas said to his son, ‘Worship Daman, for it can both help and hurt you.’ <br/>
When 'Abbas was by Damari he heard a voice saying from within it: </p>
<p>Say to all the tribes of Sulaym, </p>
<p>Damari is dead and the people of the mosque do live. </p>
<p>He of Quraysh who has inherited prophecy and guidance <br/>
After the Son of Mary is the rightly guided one. </p>
<p>Damari is dead though once he was worshipped <br/>
Before scripture came to the prophet Muhammad. </p>
<p>At that 'Abbas burned Damari and joining the prophet became a Muslim. </p>
<p>Ja'da b. 'Abdullah al-Khuza'i on the day Mecca was entered said: </p>
<p>O Ka'b b. 'Amr, hear a claim that is true <br/>
Of death decreed for him on the day of battle, </p>
<p>Decreed for him from everywhere, 1 <br/>
That he should die by night weaponless. </p>
<p>We are they whose horses closed up Ghazal, </p>
<p>And Lift and Fajju Tilah we closed up. </p>
<p>We brandished our spears behind the Muslims <br/>
In a great army supported by our horses. </p>
<p>Bujayd b. 'Imran al-Khuza'i said: </p>
<p>God created the clouds to help us, </p>
<p>Heaps of low-lying clouds one above another. </p>
<p>Our migration is in our country where we have <br/>
A book which comes from the best of dictators and writers. </p>
<p>For our sakes Mecca’s sanctuary was profaned <br/>
That we might get revenge w r ith our sharp swords. </p>
<ol>
<li>'Abbas b. Mirdas said concerning this: </li>
</ol>
<p>Since you have made Khalid chief of the army <br/>
And promoted him he has become chief indeed <br/>
In an army guided by God whose commander you are <br/>
By which we smite the wicked with every right. </p>
<p>These two verses belong to an ode of his about the battle of Hunayn which <br/>
I shall mention later, God willing. [See p. 583.] </p>
<ol>
<li>A traditionist who had it from Ibrahim b. Ja'far al-Mahmudi told me <br/>
that the apostle said: ‘In a dream I swallowed a morsel of dates mixed with <br/>
butter and enjoyed the taste of it; but some of it stuck in my gullet when I was <br/>
trying to swallow it and 'All thrust in his hand and pulled it out.’ Abu Bakr <br/>
said: ‘This is one of the parties you sent out. You will hear tidings which <br/>
you will like and dislike, and you will send 'All to put matters right.’ </li>
</ol>
<p>He told me that one of the men escaped and came to the apostle to tell <br/>
him the news. The apostle asked if anyone opposed Khalid, and he replied <br/>
that a fair man of medium height had done so but Khalid drove him away. <br/>
Another man tall and of clumsy figure argued with him until the dispute </p>
<p>1 Lit. ‘from his earth and his sky’. Cf. Werner Caskell, Das Schicksal in der altarabiscken <br/>
Poesie, Leipzig, 1926, 16 f. </p>
<p>Ibn Hishdm’s Notes 777 </p>
<p>became hot. 'Umar said that the first was his son 'Abdullah and the other <br/>
was Salim, a client of Abu Hudhayfa. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Abu 'Amr al-Madani said: When Khalid came to them they said, <br/>
‘We have changed our religion, we have changed our religion.’ </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The word Busr and ‘remained with the marriage-makers’ are not <br/>
from 1.1. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most authorities on poetry deny the authenticity of the last two lines. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More than one authority on poetry recited the first line to me. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The words ‘Take to Hawazin’ to the end of the poem deal with this <br/>
battle. What goes before has reference to something else. They are quite <br/>
distinct, but 1.1. has made them into one poem. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abu Sufyan’s son was named Ja'far, his own name being al-Mugihlra. <br/>
Some people count Qutham b. al-'Abbas among them and omit Abu <br/>
Sufyan’s son. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kalada b. al-Hanbal. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hassan b. Thabit lampooning Kalada said: </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I saw a black man afar off and he scared me. </p>
<p>’Twas Abu Hanbal leaping on Umm Hanbal. </p>
<p>’Twas as though that with which he leapt upon her belly <br/>
Was the foreleg of a camel sired by a mighty stallion! </p>
<p>Abu Zayd quoted these two verses to us, and said that in them he lampooned <br/>
§afwan b. Umayya who was half-brother to Kalada on his mother’s side. <br/>
(This passage is not in W.) </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>These two verses were not spoken by Malik and were about another <br/>
battle. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Or ‘the smell of death’. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An authority on the oral tradition of poetry quoted to me the second <br/>
hemistich in the form: </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And His cavalry has the best claim to constancy. </p>
<p>827 * Ghaylan is b. Salama al-Thaqafi, and 'Urwa is b. Mas'ud al-Thaqafi. </p>

<li>
<p>Some say I. Ladh'a. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The name of the man who killed Durayd was 'Abdullah b. Qunay' b. <br/>
Uhban b. Tha'laba b. Rabl'a. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These verses of Malik have nothing to do with this battle. You can <br/>
see that from the words of Durayd at the beginning of this account, ‘What <br/>
of Ka'b and Kilab?’ to which they replied, ‘Not one of them is here.’ Now <br/>
Ja'far was the son of Kilab and in these verses Malik says ‘Ja'far and B. <br/>
Hilal would have returned.’ </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I have heard that cavalry came up while Malik and his party were at the </p>
<p>778 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>pass and when he asked his men what they could see they said that they saw <br/>
a force who lay their lances between the ears of their long-flanked steeds. <br/>
He said that they were B. Sulaym and they had nothing to fear from them. <br/>
When they came near they took the road at the bottom of the wadi. Next <br/>
came men with no distinguishing mark carrying their lances at the side. <br/>
He said that there was nothing to fear: they were Aus and Khazraj. When <br/>
they came to the bottom of the pass they took the same road as B. Sulaym. <br/>
Then they said that they saw a horseman long of thigh carrying his lance on <br/>
his shoulder, his head wrapped in a red cloth. ‘That is al-Zubayr b. al- <br/>
'Awwam, 1 he said. ‘I swear by al-Lat that he will fight you, so stand firm/ <br/>
When al-Zubayr came to the foot of the pass he saw them and made for them <br/>
and kept thrusting at them until he drove them from it. </p>
<ol>
<li>An authority on poetry whom I do not suspect told me that Abu <br/>
'Amir al-Ash'arl met ten polytheists, all brothers, on the day of Autas. <br/>
One of them attacked and Abu 'Amir fell upon him calling him to Islam, <br/>
saying, ‘O God, testify against him,’ and he killed him. They began to <br/>
attack him one by one until he killed nine of them and then he began to <br/>
fight the tenth calling on God as before. The man cried, ‘O God, do not <br/>
testify against me,’ and Abu 'Amir let him go and he escaped and afterwards <br/>
became a good Muslim. When the apostle saw him he said, ‘This is the <br/>
survivor of Abu 'Amir’s onslaught.’ Two brothers shot Abu 'Amir, al-'Ala’ <br/>
and Aufa sons of al-Harith of B. Jusham b. Mu'awiya; one of them hit <br/>
his heart and the other his knee and so he died. Abu Musa assumed com¬ <br/>
mand and attacked and killed the pair of them. One of the B. Jusham lament¬ <br/>
ing them said: </li>
</ol>
<p>The killing of al-'Ala’ and Aufa was a calamity, </p>
<p>They could not be touched while life was in them. </p>
<p>They were the ones who killed Abu 'Amir <br/>
Who was a sharp sword with wavy marks. </p>
<p>They left him on the battlefield <br/>
As though wrapped in a crimson robe. </p>
<p>You have not seen their like among men, </p>
<p>Less likely to stumble or better shots. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>God sent down concerning the day of Hunayn: ‘God gave you victory <br/>
in many places and on the day of Hunayn when you exulted in your multi¬ <br/>
tude’ to the words ‘That is the reward of the unbelievers’ (9. 25). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the rhapsodists said about it: </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When your prophet’s uncle and friends arose <br/>
They cried, Help, O squadron of the faith! </p>
<p>Where are those who answered their Lord </p>
<p>On the day of al-'Urayd and the homage of al-Ridwan? </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The words ‘covered with dust’ are not from 1 . 1 . </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Khalaf al-Ahmar quoted to me the words ‘And cried Stop!’. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An authority on poetry recited to me ‘w r e w r ere his right w r ing’, &amp;c., <br/>
but he knew nothing of the verse beginning ‘we carried his banner’. After </p>

<p>Ibn Hishams Notes </p>
<p>779 </p>
<p>the line ‘We had charge of the flag’ he recited the line ‘We dyed it with <br/>
blood’. </p>
<p>837* Abu Ubavda told me that Zuhayr b. al- Ajwa al-Hudhali was taken <br/>
prisoner at Hunayn and handcuffed. Jamil b. Ma'mar al-Jumahi saw him <br/>
and said, Are you the man w'ho has been acting offensively against us ?’, <br/>
and he struck off his head. Abu Khirash, w r ho was his nephew, said in <br/>
lamenting him: </p>
<p>Jamil b. Ma'mar has half-starved my guests <br/>
By killing a generous man to whom widows resorted. </p>
<p>The belt of his sword was long, no short one when he brandished it. </p>
<p>And the cord was loose upon him . 1 </p>
<p>So generous he would almost give away his girdle </p>
<p>When the cold north w'inds were fierce. </p>
<p>To his tent the poor man went in winter <br/>
And the poor night traveller in his worn-out rags <br/>
Who goes half-frozen when the night winds blow <br/>
Driving him to seek refuge. </p>
<p>What ails the people of the camp that they did not separate <br/>
When the eloquent chief had gone ? </p>
<p>I swear if you had met him when he was not bound <br/>
Hyaenas would have visited you at the mountain foot. </p>
<p>If you had faced him when you met him </p>
<p>And fought him if you are a fighter </p>
<p>Jamil would have met the most ignominious end; </p>
<p>But a man whose hands are bound cannot defend himself . 2 <br/>
We were not as we used to be at home, O Umm Thabit, </p>
<p>But chains were round our necks. </p>
<p>The young man like the old man does naught but what is right, </p>
<p>And the women blamers have nothing to say. </p>
<p>Sincere brethren have become as though <br/>
One had poured on them the dust of the grave. </p>
<p>But don t think that I have forgotten the nights in Mecca <br/>
When we could not be held back from what we took in hand, </p>
<p>When men were men and the country was famous <br/>
And doors were not shut in our faces. </p>

<p>It is said that his name was Abu Thawab Ziyad b. Thawab. Khalaf <br/>

dripping with blood. She said, ‘I see that you have been fighting, and what <br/>
plunder have you got from the polytheists?’ He said ‘Take this needle to <br/>
make your clothes with’ and handed it to her. Then he heard the apostle’s <br/>
crier ordering men to return anything they had taken even to a needle and <br/>
thread; so he came back and said ‘I’m afraid you have lost your needle’ and <br/>
took it and threw it into the common stock. </p>

<p>Yunus al-Nahwi quoted me the verse with the word ‘Mirdas’ in place <br/>

<p>A traditionist told me that 'Abbas b. Mirdas came to the apostle who <br/>
said to him, ‘So you are the one who said: </p>

</ol>
<p>My spoil and that of ‘Ubayd my horse <br/>
Is shared by al-Aqra' and 'Uyayna.’ </p>
<p>Abu Bakr said, ‘Between 'Uyayna and al-Aqra’.’ The apostle said, ‘It’s <br/>
the same thing.’ Abu Bakr said, ‘I testify that you are as God said, “We have <br/>
not taught him poetry and that is not fitting for him” ’ (Sura 36. 69). </p>
<p>A traditionist in whom I have confidence from al-Zuhri—'Ubaydullah b. <br/>

Quraysh and others and gave them on the day of al-Ji'rana some of the spoil <br/>
of I^unayn, thus: </p>

<li>When the apostle made these gifts to Quraysh and the Beduin tribes <br/>
and gave nothing to the Ansar, Hassan b. Thabit reproached him in the <br/>
following verse: </li>
</ol>
<p>Anxieties increased and tears flowed copiously </p>
<p>While I wept continuously </p>
<p>In longing for Shamma’ the lovely, the slender, </p>
<p>Without impurity or weakness. </p>
<p>Speak no more of Shamma’ since her love has waned, </p>
<p>(When love has grown cold there is no joy in meeting), </p>
<p>And come to the apostle and say, O thou most trusted <br/>
By believers from all mankind. </p>
<p>Why were Sulaym invited—mere outsiders, </p>
<p>Before a people who gave you shelter and help ? </p>
<p>God called them Helpers because they helped true religion <br/>
While repeated wars broke out </p>
<p>And they vied in running in the way of God, enduring hardship, <br/>
Showing neither cowardice nor alarm. </p>
<p>And when men gathered against us for your sake <br/>
And we had but our swords and lances as a refuge <br/>
We fought them, sparing none <br/>
And abandoned nothing revealed in the suras. </p>
<p>Those who love war do not shun our assembly <br/>
And when its fire blazed we were the kindlers. </p>
<p>As we repelled the hypocrites at Badr their hopes unrealized <br/>
And through us victory was sent down. 1 <br/>
We were your army at the mountain slope of Uhud <br/>
When Mudar insolently gathered their adherents. </p>
<p>We were not remiss or cow'ardly, </p>
<p>And they did not find us stumblers though all others were. </p>
<ol>
<li>I have heard that Zayd b. Aslam said that when the apostle appointed <br/>
'Attab as governor in Mecca his allowance was a dirham a day. He got up </li>
</ol>
<p>1 Or perhaps 'Concerning us the verse about “victory” was sent down’. </p>
<p>7S2 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>and addressed the people in these words: ‘God make hungry the liver of a <br/>
man who is hungry on a dirham a day! The apostle has allowed me a dirham <br/>
every day and I have no need of any one.’ </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The apostle arrived in Medina on 24th Dhu’l-Qa'da according to what <br/>
'Amr al-Madanl alleged. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another version is Al-Ma’mur (the one under orders). The words <br/>
‘Tell me plainly’ are not from Ibn Ishaq. An authority on poetry quoted me <br/>
the lines thus: </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Who will give Bujayr a message from me: </p>
<p>Do you accept what I said at the mountain foot ? </p>
<p>You have drunk w r ith al-Ma’mun a full cup <br/>
And he has added a second draught of the same. </p>
<p>You have gone against true guidance and followed him. </p>
<p>Woe to you, to what has he led you? </p>
<p>To a religion your parents knew naught of <br/>
And your brother has naught to do with. </p>
<p>If you don’t accept what I say I shall not grieve <br/>
Nor say if you stumble God help you! </p>
<p>He sent this to Bujayr, and when he received it he did not like to hide it <br/>
from the apostle so he recited it to him. When he heard the W'ords ‘Al- <br/>
Ma’mun has given you a full cup* he said, ‘That is true and he is the liar! <br/>
I am al-Ma’mun’; and w r hen he heard the words ‘A religion your parents <br/>
knew naught of’ he said, ‘Certainly, his father and mother did not follow it.’ </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Or al-Ma’mur. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ka r b composed this ode after he came to the apostle at Medina. His <br/>
verses ‘The qurad crawls over her’ and ‘Onagerlike is she’ and ‘She lets a <br/>
tail’ and ‘When he springs on his adversary’ and ‘Albeit ever in his wadi’ <br/>
are not on the authority of 1.1. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is said that the apostle said to him when he recited to him ‘Su'ad is <br/>
gone’, ‘Why didn’t you speak well of the Ansar, for they deserve such <br/>
mention ?’ So Ka‘b spoke these words in an ode of his. I was told that ‘All <br/>
b. Zayd b. Jud'an said that Ka‘b recited ‘Su r ad has gone’ to the apostle in <br/>
the mosque. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A trustworthy person told me on the authority of Muhammad b. <br/>
Talha b. ‘Abdu’l-Rahman from Ishaq b. Ibrahim b. ‘Abdullah b. Haritha <br/>
from his father from his grandfather: The apostle heard that the hypocrites <br/>
were assembling in the house of Suwaylim the Jew (his house was by Jasum) <br/>
keeping men back from the apostle in the raid on Tabuk. So the prophet <br/>
sent Talha b. ‘Ubaydullah w T ith a number of his friends to them with orders <br/>
to bum Suwaylim’s house down on them. Talha did so, and al-Dahhak b. <br/>
Khalifa threw himself from the top of the house and broke his leg, and his <br/>
friends rushed out and escaped. Al-Dahhak said concerning that: </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By God’s temple Muhammad’s fire <br/>
Almost burnt Dahhak and Ibn Ubayriq. </p>
<p>Ibn Hi sham's Notes </p>
<p>783 </p>
<p>I had gone to the top of Suwaylim’s house </p>
<p>And I crawled away on one w'hole leg and my elbow. </p>
<p>My salaams to you, I’ll ne’er do the like again <br/>
I’m afraid. He whom fire surrounds is burned. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A trustworthy person told me that ‘Uthman spent on the raiding force <br/>
a thousand dinars. The apostle said, ‘O God, be pleased with‘Uthman for <br/>
I am pleased with him.’ </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He put Muhammad b. Maslama al-Ansarl in charge of Medina. <br/>
Abdu’l- Aziz b. Muhammad al-Darawardl from his father told me that <br/>
he put Siba b. ‘Urfuta (T. brother of B. Ghifar) over Medina when he <br/>
set out for Tabuk. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abu Khaythama (his name was Malik b. Qays) said: </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When I saw men hypocritical in religion <br/>
I undertook that which is more chaste and nobler. </p>
<p>And I pledged my fealty to Muhammad. </p>
<p>And did no sin or wrong. </p>
<p>I left the dyed one in the hut </p>
<p>Where dates had ripened and camels were full of milk. </p>
<p>When the hypocrite doubted my soul </p>
<p>Flowed gently to the religion following wherever it led. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I have heard that al-Zuhrl said: When the apostle passed by al-Hijr <br/>
he covered his face with his cloak and urged his camel on saying, ‘Do not go <br/>
among the houses of those who sinned unless you are riding fast for fear that <br/>
you may meet with the fate that befell them.’ </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Others say I. Lusayb. [T. also has this reading, so that an early <br/>
scribe is probably at fault.] </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some say Makhshly. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He was called Dhu’l-Bijadayn because when he broke away to Islam <br/>
his people tried to stop him and so persecuted him that they left him with <br/>
only one garment upon him. (The bijad is a coarse rough wrapper.) He fled <br/>
from them to the apostle, and when he came near he rent his bijad into two <br/>
parts, girding his middle with one and wrapping himself in the other. Then <br/>
he came to the apostle and was called ‘He of the two garments’. Bijad also <br/>
means a cloak of black hair, as in the words of Imru’u’l-Qays: </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And when at first its misty shroud bore dow r n on Aban’s top <br/>
He stood like an ancient man in a grey-streaked mantle wrapped. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Or ‘than their eyesight’. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BLfatrina is the same as bi-faturina. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Latubkayanna is not from 1 . 1 . [This is a most interesting note. <br/>
Obviously I.H. is querying only the one word, and in T. we have ala'bkiyan <br/>
which must be right. The doggerel is in the familiar ‘ I’m the king of the castle* <br/>
mould which seems to have been frequently used by women when uttering <br/>
taunts. The translation is no worse than the original!] </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>784 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<ol>
<li>Ill means hilf (treaty or oath). Aus b. Hajar, one of B. Usayyid b. <br/>
'Amr b. Tamlm, said: </li>
</ol>
<p>Were it not for Banu Malik who respect a treaty, </p>
<p>For Malik are an honourable people who respect treaties. </p>
<p>This verse occurs in an ode of his. Plural dial . The poet says: </p>
<p>There is no treaty whatever between me and you, </p>
<p>So do not relax your effort. </p>
<p>Dhimma means ’ahd (compact). Al-Ajda r b. Malik al-Hamdanl, who was <br/>
the father of Masruq b. al-Ajdai the lawyer, said: </p>
<p>There is an agreement binding on us </p>
<p>That you should not overstep our boundary near or far. </p>
<p>This is one of three verses of his. Plural dhimam. </p>
<ol>
<li>Wallja means dakhil (friend), plural zvala’ij from walaja, yaliju, he <br/>
entered; and in God’s book ‘until a camel goes through the eye of a needle’ <br/>
(7. 38). He says they have not chosen a friend other than him, concealing <br/>
feelings towards him other than they show, like the disaffected do displaying <br/>
faith to those who believe ‘and w r hen they go apart to their devils they say: <br/>
We are with you’ (2. 13). The poet says: </li>
</ol>
<p>Know that you have been made a friend <br/>
To whom they bring undiluted death. </p>
<ol>
<li>Auda'u khilalakum means ‘hurried among your lines’. Ida is a way <br/>
of moving, faster than walking. Al-Ajda' b. Malik al-Hamdanl said: </li>
</ol>
<p>My gallant horse wall catch a wild bull for you <br/>
By outrunning it at a pace between a gallop and a trot. </p>
<p>[Perhaps the wild bull itself is addressed.] </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Some ascribe the poem to his son 'Abdu’l-Rahman. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The last hemistich is not from 1 . 1 . </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The words ‘and he has given us a name’ are not from 1 . 1 . </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abu Zayd al-Ansari quoted to me the verses ‘They were kings, &amp;c.,’ <br/>
and ‘In Yathrib they had built forts’ and ‘Dark bays, spirited’ as from him. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abu 'Ubayda told me that that was in the year 9 and that it was called <br/>
the year of the deputations. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Not Habhab but) al-Hutat. The apostle established brotherhood <br/>
between him and Mu'awiya b. Abu Sufyan. The apostle did this between <br/>
a number of his companions, ,e.g. between Abu Bakr and 'Umar; 'Uthman <br/>
and 'Abdu’l-Rahman b. 'Auf; Talha b. ‘Ubaydullah and al~Zubayr b. al- <br/>
'Awwam; Abu Dharr al-Ghifari and al-Miqdad b. ‘Amr al-Bahrani; and <br/>
Mu'awiya b. Abu Sufyan and al-Hutat b. Yazld al-Mujashi'I. Al-Hutat died <br/>
in the presence of Mu'awiya during his caliphate and by virtue of this </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I bn Hishdm’s Notes &lt;78- </p>
<p>brotherhood Mu'awiya took what he left as his heir. AI-Farazdaq said to <br/>
Mu'aw'iya: </p>
<p>Your father and my uncle, O Mu'awiya, left an inheritance <br/>
So that his next of kin might inherit it. </p>
<p>But how come you to devour the estate of al-Hutat <br/>
When the solid estate of Harb was melting in your hand ? </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>And 'Utarid b. Hajib, one of B. Darim b. Malik b. Hanzala b. Malik <br/>
b. Zayd Manat b. Tamlm; and ai-Aqra' b. Habis, one of B. Darim b <br/>
Malik; and al-Hutat b. Yazld of the same; and al-Zibriqan b. Badr, one of <br/>
B. Bahdala b. 'Auf b. Ka'b b. Sa'd b. Zayd Manat b. Tamlm; and 'Amr b. <br/>
al-Ahtam, one of B. Mirtqar b. 'Ubayd b. al-Harith b. 'Amr b. Ka'b- b. <br/>
Sa'd b. Zayd Manat b. Tamlm; and Qays b. 'A?im, one of B. Minqar. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another version is: </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>From us kings are born and we take the fourth </p>
<p>and </p>
<p>From every land submissively, so we are obeyed. </p>
<p>One of the B. Tamlm recited it to me, but most authorities on poetry deny <br/>
al-Zibriqan’s authorship. </p>
<ol>
<li>Abu Zayd quoted the verse thus: </li>
</ol>
<p>Everyone whose heart is devout </p>
<p>Approves of it and the thing they have begun. </p>
<p>An authority on poetry among B. Tamim told me that when al-Zibriqan <br/>
came with the deputation to the apostle he got up and said: </p>
<p>We have come to you that men may know our superiority <br/>
Whenever they gather at the fairs <br/>
That we are the foremost in every field <br/>
And that none in al-Hijaz are like Darim. </p>
<p>That we put champions to flight in their arrogance <br/>
And smite the heads of the proud and powerful. </p>
<p>Ours is the fourth part in every raid <br/>
In Najd or in foreign lands. </p>
<p>Then Hassan got up and answered him saying: </p>
<p>Is glory aught but ancient lordship and generosity, </p>
<p>The dignity of kings and the bearing of great burdens ? </p>
<p>We helped and sheltered the prophet iVIuhammad <br/>
Whether Ma'add liked it or not <br/>
In a unique tribe whose root and wealth <br/>
Is in Jabiyatu’l-Jaulan among the foreigners. </p>
<p>W e helped him when he dwelt among us <br/>
Against every -wrongful aggressor. </p>
<p>We put our sons and daughters before him </p>
<p>And we were pleased to forgo the spoils for his sake. 1 </p>
<p>n 4080 </p>
<p>At Hunayn. </p>
<p>3 E </p>
<p>786 </p>
<p>The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>We smote men with our sharp swords <br/>
Until they flocked to his religion <br/>
And we begat the greatest of Quraysh. 1 <br/>
We begat the prophet of good of Hashim’s line. </p>
<p>Do not boast, O Banu Darirn, for your boast <br/>
Will turn to shame when noble deeds are mentioned. </p>
<p>Curse you, would you boast against us </p>
<p>When you are our servants, half wet-nurses and half slaves? </p>
<p>If you’ve come to save your lives and property <br/>
Lest they be divided as booty, </p>
<p>Then give not God an equal and embrace Islam <br/>
And do not dress like foreigners. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There is another verse which we have omitted because it is obscene. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another version is ‘O boil like the boils of a camel and death in the <br/>
house of a Saluli woman!’ </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Zayd b. Aslam from "Ata’ b. Yasar from I. "Abbas said: God sent down <br/>
concerning 'Amir and Arbad: ‘God knows what every female carries, what <br/>
the wombs keep small and what grows larger’ as far as the words ‘and they <br/>
have no friend against Him.’ He said, ‘The mu'aqqibat are those who “by <br/>
God’s order” protect Muhammad.’ Then He mentioned Arbad and how <br/>
God killed him and said ‘And He sends thunderbolts and He smites whom <br/>
He will’ as far as the words ‘powerful in device’ (13. 9-14). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His verse ‘Who spoiled the spoiler’ is on the authority of Abu "Ubayda <br/>
and his verse ‘Liberal when times were bad’ has not I.L’s authority. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The last verse has not I.L’s authority. [It is to be found in Die Gedichte <br/>
des Labid , ed. C. Brockelmann, Leiden, 1891, p. 2, with some variants.] </p>

<p>al-Jarud b. Bishr b. al-Mu'alla was in the deputation. He w*as a <br/>

among whom were Mahk b. Nam*, and Abu Thaur Dhu'l-.Mish'ar, and <br/>

al-Khanfi came and met the apostle on his return from Tabuk, wearing <br/>
robes ofV aman cloth, and turbans of Aden, with wooden saddles on Mahri <br/>
and ArhabI camels. Malik b. Namat and another man were the rajaz <br/>
singers or the people, one of them saying i </p>

<p>While the other responded: </p>
<p>Camels haltered with ropes of palm </p>
<p>Pass through land knowing water’s balm. </p>
<p>The dust of summer does no harm. </p>
<p>This Malik stood before the apostle and said, ‘O apostle of God, the <br/>
choicest of Hamdan’s settled and nomad folk have come to you on fine <br/>
swift camels, linked by the cords of Islam. No blame so far as God is con¬ <br/>
cerned attaches to them from the district of Kharif and Yam and Shakir <br/>
the camel and horse folk. They have answered the apostle’s call and have <br/>
withdrawn from the goddesses and sacrificial stones. Their word will not be <br/>
broken while stands mount La‘la r and while the young hart runs on SalaV </p>
<p>The apostle wrote a letter for them: ‘To the district of Kharif and the <br/>
people of the high country and the sand hills with their envoy Dhu’l-Mish'ar <br/>
Malik b. Nama{ and those of his people who are Muslims. Theirs is the high <br/>
ground and the low ground so long as they perform prayer and pay alms; <br/>
they may eat its fodder and pasture on its herbage. For this they have God’s <br/>
promise and the guarantee of His apostle and their witnesses are the emigrants <br/>
and the helpers.’ </p>
<p>Malik b. Nama{ said concerning this: </p>
<p>I remembered the apostle in the darkness of the night <br/>
When we were above Rahrahan and Saldad <br/>
While the camels tired with sunken eyes <br/>
Carried their riders on a far-stretching road. </p>
<p>Strong, long-striding camels </p>
<p>Carried us along like well-fed ostriches. </p>
<p>I swear by the Lord of the camels that run to Mina <br/>
Returning with riders from a lofty height <br/>
That the apostle of God is held true among us, </p>

<p>The apostle had sent some of his companions as messengers carrying <br/>
letters to the kings inviting them to Islam. One in whom I have confidence <br/>
on the authority of Abu Bakr al-Hudhali told me: ‘It reached me that the <br/>
apostle went out one day after his 'umra from which he had been excluded <br/>
on the day of al-Hudaybiya and said “God has sent me as a mercy to all <br/>
men, so do not hang back from me as the disciples hung back from Jesus <br/>
son of Mary.” ’ They asked how they had hung back and he said: ‘He called <br/>
them to that to which I have called you. Those who were sent on a near <br/>
mission were satisfied and content; those who w'ere sent on a distant mission <br/>
showed their displeasure and took it as a burden, and Jesus complained of </p>

<p>THE SENDING OF 'AMR B. UMAYYA AL-PAMRI TO KILL <br/>
ABU SUFYAN B. HARB AND WHAT HE DID ON THE WAY </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Among the missions and expeditions which the apostle sent out which Ibn <br/>
Ishaq does not record 1 is the mission of 'Amr b. Umayya al-Damn, whom the <br/>
apostle sent to Mecca—according to what a trustworthy traditionist told me— <br/>
after the killing of Khubayb b. c AdTy and his companions, ordering him to <br/>
kill Abu Sufyan b. Harb. With him he sent Jabbar b. $akhr al-Ansari. <br/>
When they reached Mecca they tied their two camels in one of the narrow <br/>
passes of Ya’jaj and entered the town by night. Jabbar suggested to 'Amr <br/>
that they should circumambulate the temple and pray two rak'as, to which <br/>
r Amr replied that at night the inhabitants were wont to sit in their court¬ <br/>
yards. ‘God willing they won’t be,’ he replied. 'Amr said: We went round <br/>
the temple and prayed and then came away making for Abu Sufyan. As <br/>
we were walking in the tow r n a man looked at me and recognized me and <br/>
cried, ‘It’s 'Amr b, Umayya. By God, he has come only for some evil <br/>
purpose.’ I told my companion to run and we went out quickly and got up a <br/>
mountain, and they came out in pursuit of us and did not desist until we had <br/>
got to its top. We came back and went into a cave in the mountain and passed <br/>
the night there, having piled rocks in front of it. In the morning came a <br/>
man of Quraysh leading a horse, cutting grass for it, drawing near to us as <br/>
we were in the cave. I said, ‘If he sees us he will give the alarm knd we shall <br/>
be taken and killed.’ Now I had a dagger with me which I had got ready for <br/>
Abu Sufyan, and I stabbed him in the chest and he gave a cry which reached <br/>
the ears of the Meccans, so I went back and entered the cave. The men came <br/>
running to him as he was at the last gasp and asked him who had stabbed him </p>
<p>1 This statement implies that the MS. which I.H. had contained no account of these <br/>
happenings, but the extract from T a h. 1437 f» which I have restored to the text gives a <br/>
graphic description on the authority of 1 . 1 . S. also points out that I.H. is in error in saying <br/>
that 1.1. does not report the story. </p>
<p>Ibn Hi sham’s Notes 791 </p>
<p>and he said '.Amr b. Umayya, and died on the spot without having revealed <br/>
where we were. They carried him away. When night fell I told my com¬ <br/>
panion that we must get away, so we left Mecca making for Medina. We <br/>
passed by some guards who w r ere watching the corpse of Khubayb b. <br/>
Adly when one of them said, ‘By God, I have never seen before tonight <br/>
anything more like the gait of 'Amr b. Umayya; were it not that he is in <br/>
Medina I should have said that it was he.’ When he came in face of the <br/>
gallows he ran to it and took it and carried it away, and the two of them <br/>
hurried off, while they (the guards) came behind him, until he came to a <br/>
hollow in the clifF at the ravine of Ya’jaj where he threw the gallows into the <br/>
hollow' and God hid him from them while they could do nothing. I said to my <br/>
companion, ‘Escape! Escape! until you get to your camel and mount it <br/>
while I occupy the men so that they cannot hinder you’, for the Ansarl <br/>
could hardly walk. </p>
<p>I went on until I came out at Dajnan; 1 then I betook me to a mountain <br/>
and entered a cave. While I was there suddenly an old man of B. al-Dil, a <br/>
one-eyed man, came in with a young sheep and asked who I was. I told him <br/>
I w&gt;as of B. Bakr and he said he was too. I said ‘Welcome,’ and as he stretched <br/>
himself out he lifted up his voice and said: </p>
<p>I won’t be a Muslim as long as I live <br/>
Nor heed to their religion give, </p>
<p>I said to myself ‘You wall soon know!’ I gave him time until when he was <br/>
asleep I took my bow- and inserted the end of it in his sound eye and bore <br/>
down upon it until it reached the bone. Then I hurried off until I came to <br/>
al-'Arj, 2 then Rakuba 3 until I dropped down to al-Naqf 4 where there w ; ere <br/>
two polytheists of Quraysh who had been sent as spies to Medina. I called on <br/>
them to surrender but they refused, so I shot one and killed him and the <br/>
other surrendered. I bound him tightly and took him to Medina. </p>

<li>ZAYD B. HARITHA’S EXPEDITION TO MADYAN </li>
</ol>
<p>This is recorded by 'Abdullah b. Hasan b. Hasan from his mother Fatima d. <br/>
al-Husayn b. 'All. Zayd was accompanied by Dumayra, a client of 'All’s, <br/>
and a brother of his. They took several captives from the people of Mina’ <br/>
which is on the shore, a mixed lot among them. They were sold as slaves and <br/>
families were separated. The apostle arrived as they were weeping and <br/>
inquired the reason. When he was told he said, ‘Sell them onlv in lots’, <br/>
meaning the mothers, with the children. </p>
<ol>
<li>I have heard that when he went on the little pilgrimage he uttered the <br/>
cry ‘Labbayka’ in the vale of Mecca. He w T as the first to enter Mecca with the <br/>
cry. Quraysh seized him and exclaimed at his audacity. They were about to <br/>
strike off his head when one of them said, ‘Let him alone, for you have need <br/>
of al-Yamama for your food’ so they let him go his way. </li>

<p>Ibn Hisham's Notes </p>
<p>792 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>Concerning this al-Hanafi said: </p>
<p>It was our man who said publicly in Mecca </p>
<p>In the sacred months ‘labbayka’ despite Abu Sufyan. </p>
<p>I was told that when he became a Muslim he said to the apostle: ‘Your face <br/>
used to be the most hateful to me, but now it is the most beloved.’ He spoke <br/>
similarly about (his) religion and country. Then he went on the little pil¬ <br/>
grimage, and when he came to Mecca they said, ‘Have you changed your <br/>
religion, Thumama?’ ‘No,’ he said, ‘but I follow the best religion, the <br/>
religion of Muhammad; and by God not a grain of corn will reach you from <br/>
al-Yamama until the apostle gives permission.’ He went back to al-Yamama <br/>
and prevented them from sending anything to Mecca. Then the people <br/>
wrote to the apostle: ‘You order that ties of kinship should be observed, yet <br/>
you sever those with us; you have killed the fathers with the sword and the <br/>
children with hunger.’ So the apostle wrote to him to let the carriage of <br/>
food go on. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Abu 'Amr al-Madani said: The apostle sent 'All to the Yaman and sent <br/>
Khalid b. al-Walld with another force and ordered that when the forces <br/>
met 'All was to be in supreme command. 1 . 1 . mentioned the sending of <br/>
Khalid in his account, but he did not reckon it among the missions and <br/>
expeditions so that the number of them in his account ought to be 39. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the last mission which the apostle dispatched. </p>

<p>THE APOSTLE’S WIVES </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>They were nine: 'A’isha d. Abu Bakr; Hafsa d. 'Umar; Umm Idabiba <br/>
d. Abu Sufyan; Umm Salama d. Abu Um£yya b. al-Mughlra; Sauda d. <br/>
Zama'a b. Qays; Zaynab d. Jahsh b. Ri’ab; Maymuna d. al-Harith b. <br/>
Hazn; Juwayriya d. al-Harith b. Abu Dirar; and $aflya d. Huyay b. Akhtab <br/>
according to what more than one traditionist has told me. </p>
<p>He married thirteen women: KhadTja d. Khuwaylid, his first wife whom <br/>
her father Khuwaylid b. Asad, or according to others her brother 'Amr, <br/>
married to him. The apostle gave her as dowry twenty she-camels. She <br/>
bare all the apostle’s children except Ibrahim. She had been previously <br/>
married to Abu Hala b. Malik, one of B. Usayyid b. 'Amr b. Tamim, an ally <br/>
of B. 'Abdu’l-Dar to whom she bore Hind b. Abu Hala and Zaynab. Before <br/>
that she had been married to 'Utayyiq b. 'Abid b. 'Abdullah b. 'Umar b. <br/>
MakhzQm to whom she bore 'Abdullah and Jariya. </p>
<p>He married 'A’isha in Mecca when she was a child of seven and lived with <br/>
her in Medina when she was nine or ten. She was the only virgin that he <br/>
married. Her father, Abu Bakr, married her to him and the apostle gave her <br/>
four hundred dirhams. </p>
<p>He married Sauda d. Zama'a b. Qays b. 'Abdu Shams b. 'Abdu Wudd b. <br/>
Na§r b. Malik b. Hisl b. 'Amir b. Lu’ayy. Salit b. 'Amr, or according to <br/>
others Abu Hafib b. 'Amr, married her to him, and the apostle gave her <br/>
four hundred dirhams. </p>
<p>Ibn Ishaq contradicts this tradition saying that Sallt and Abu Hapb were <br/>
absent in Abyssinia at this time. Before that she had been married to al- <br/>
Sakran b. 'Amr b, 'Abdu Shams. </p>
<p>793 </p>
<p>He married Zaynab d. Jahsh b. Ri’ab al-Asadlya. Her brother Abu Ahmad <br/>
married her to him and the apostle gave her four hundred dirhams. She <br/>
had been previously married to Zayd b. Haritha, the freed slave of the <br/>
apostle, and it was about her that God sent down: ‘So when Zayd had done <br/>
as he wished in divorcing her We married her to you.’ 1 </p>
<p>He married Umm Salama d. Abu Umayya b. al-Mughlra al-Makh- <br/>
zumiya. Her name was Hind. Her son Salama b. Abu Salama married her <br/>
to him and the apostle gave her a bed stuffed with palm-leaves, a bowl, a <br/>
dish, and a handmill. She had been married to Abu Salama b. 'Abdu’l-Asad <br/>
whose name was 'Abdullah. She had borne him Salama, 'Umar, Zaynab, <br/>
and Ruqayya. </p>
<p>He married Hafsa d. 'Umar with her father’s consent and the apostle <br/>
gave her four hundred dirhams. She had been married to Khunays b. <br/>
Hudhafa al-Sahml. </p>
<p>He married Umm Hablba whose name was Ramla d. Abu Sufyan. Khalid <br/>
b. Sa'fd b. al-'As married her to him when they were both in Abyssinia and <br/>
the Negus gave her on behalf of the apostle four hundred dinars. It was he <br/>
who arranged the marriage for the apostle. She had been married to <br/>
'Ubaydullah b. Jahsh al-Asadi. </p>
<p>He married Juwayriya d. al-Harith b. Abu Qirar al-Khuza'iya who was <br/>
among the captives of B. Mustaliq of Khyza'a. She had fallen to the lot of <br/>
Thabit b. Qays b. al-Shammas al-Ansari and he wrote a contract of redemp¬ <br/>
tion which she brought to the apostle asking his help. He asked her if she <br/>
would like something better than that, and when she asked what that could <br/>
be he said, ‘Shall I rid you of the contract and marry you myself?’ She said <br/>
Yes, and so he married her. This tradition was given us by Ziyad b. 'Ab¬ <br/>
dullah al-Bakka’i from Muhammad b. Ishaq from Muhammad b. Ja'far <br/>
b. al-Zubayr from 'Urwa from 'A’isha. 2 </p>
<p>It is said that when the apostle came back from the raid on B. al-Mustaliq <br/>
with Juw r ayriya and was in the midst of the army he gave Juwayriya to one <br/>
of the Ansar and ordered him to guard her. When the apostle reached Medina <br/>
her father al-Harith came to him with his daughter’s ransom. When he was <br/>
in al-'Aqiq he had looked at the camels which he had brought for the ransom <br/>
and admired two of them greatly, so he hid them in one of the passes of <br/>
al-'Aqiq. Then he came to the prophet saying, ‘Here is my daughter’s <br/>
ransom.’ The apostle said: ‘But where are the two camels which you hid <br/>
in al-'Aqiq in such-and-such a pass ?’ Al-Harith said, ‘I testify that there is no <br/>
God but Allah and that you are the apostle of God, for by God none could <br/>
have known of that but God most High’; so he became a Muslim, as did two <br/>
of his sons who were with him and some of his people. He sent and fetched <br/>
the two camels and handed them over to the prophet and his daughter <br/>
Juwayriya was given back to him. She became an excellent Muslim. The <br/>
apostle asked her father to let him marry her and he agreed and the apostle <br/>
gave her four hundred dirhams. She had been previously married to a cousin <br/>
of hers called 'Abdullah. It is said that the apostle bought her from Thabit <br/>
b. Qays, freed her, married her, and gave her four hundred dirhams. </p>
<p>He married $aflya d. Huyay b. Akhtab whom he had captured at Khaybar </p>
<p>1 Sura 33 . 37 . </p>
<p>2 This comment refers to what 1 . 1 , reported on W., p. 729. </p>
<p>794 The Life of Muhammad </p>
<p>and chosen for himself. The apostle made a feast of gruel and dates: there <br/>
was no meat or fat. 1 She had been married to Rinana b. al-Rabi' b. Abu’I- <br/>
Huqayq. </p>
<p>He married Maymuna d. al-Harith b. Hazn b. Bahir b. Huzam b. Ruwayba <br/>
b. "Abdullah b. Hilal b. 'Amir b. Sa'sa'a, Al-'Abbas b. 'Abdu’ 1 -Muttalib <br/>
married her to him and gave her on the apostle’s behalf four hundred <br/>
dirhams. She had been married to Abu Ruhm b. "Abdu’l-"Uzza b. \bu <br/>
Qays b. "Abdu Wudd b. Nasr b. Malik b. Hisl b. "Amir b. Lu'ayy. It is <br/>
said that it was she who gave herself to the prophet because his offer of <br/>
marriage came to her when she was on her camel. She said, ‘The camel and <br/>
what is on it belongs to God and His apostle.’ So God sent down: ‘And <br/>
a believing woman if she gives herself to the prophet.’ 2 </p>
<p>It is said that the one who gave herself to the prophet was Zaynab d <br/>
Jahsh, or Umm Sharlk Ghaziya d. Jabir b. Wahb of B. Munqidh b. ’Amr <br/>
b. Ma is b. Amir b. Lu ayy. Others say it was a woman of B. Sama b. <br/>
Lu ayy and the apostle postponed the matter. </p>
<p>He married Zaynab d. Khuzayma b. al-Harith b. "Abdullah b. 'Amr b. <br/>
Abdu Manaf b. Hilal b. "Amir b. Sa"sa"a who was called ‘Mother of the <br/>
Poor’ because of her kindness to them and her pity for them. Qablsa b. <br/>
Amr al-Hilali married her to him and the apostle gave her four hundred <br/>
dirhams. She had been married to ‘Ubayda b. al-Harith b. al-Muttalib b <br/>
Abdu Manaf; before that to Jahm b. "Amr b. al-Harith who was her cousin. </p>
<p>The apostle consummated his marriage with eleven women, two of whom <br/>
died before him, namely Khadija and Zaynab. He died leaving the nine we <br/>
have mentioned. With two he had no marital relations, namely Asma d. <br/>
al-Nu'man, the Kindite woman, whom he married and found to be suffering <br/>
from leprosy and so returned to her people with a suitable gift; and "Amra <br/>
d. Yazid the Kilab woman who was recently an unbeliever. When she came to <br/>
the apostle she said ‘I seek God’s protection against you,’ and he replied that <br/>
one who did that was inviolable so he sent her back to her people. Others <br/>
say that the one who said this was a Kindite woman, a cousin of Asma’ d. <br/>
aI-Nu"man, and that the apostle summoned her and she said ‘We are a people <br/>
to whom others come; we come to none!’ so he returned her to her people. </p>
<p>, There were six Quraysh women among the prophet’s wives, namely, <br/>
Khadija, "A’isha, Hafsa, Umm Hablba, Umm Salama, and Sauda. 3 </p>
<p>The ^ Arab women and others were seven, namely, Zaynab d. Jahsh, <br/>
Maymuna Zaynab d. Khuzayma, Juwayriya, Asma, and "Amra. The <br/>
non-Arab woman was Saflya d. Huyay b. Akhtab of B. al-Nadir. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Another tradition is ‘except Abu Bakr’s door’, </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abu "Ubayda and other traditionists told me that when the apostle was <br/>
dead most of the Meccans meditated withdrawing from Islam and made up <br/>
their minds to do so. Attab b. Asid 4 went in such fear of them that he hid <br/>
himself. Then Suhayl b. "Amr arose and after giving thanks to God mentioned <br/>
the death of the apostle and said, ‘That will increase Islam in force. If </p>

<p>1 Presumably because she was a Jewess and would eat only kosher meat. </p>

<p>3 The genealogies which have already been given have been omitted. </p>
<p>4 He was governor of Mecca when the prophet died. </p>
<p>I bn Hishains Notes </p>
<p>795 </p>
<p>anyone troubles us we will cut off his head.’ Thereupon the people aban¬ <br/>
doned their intention and "Attab reappeared once more. This is the stand <br/>
which the apostle meant w r hen he said to "Umar: ‘It may well be that he will <br/>
take a stand for which you cannot blame him’ [z/.s. p. 312]. </p>
<ol>
<li>Hassan b. Thabit said, mourning the apostle, according to what Ibn <br/>
Hisham told us on the authority of Abu Zayd al-Ansari: 1 </li>
</ol>
<p>In Tayba 2 there is still the impress and luminous abode of the apostle, <br/>
Though elsew'here traces disappear and perish. </p>
<p>The marks of the sacred building that holds </p>
<p>The pulpit w'hich the guide used to ascend will never be obliterated. </p>
<p>Plain are the traces and lasting the marks </p>
<p>And his house with its mosque and place of prayer. </p>
<p>There are the rooms w'here God’s light <br/>
Used to come down brilliant and bright, </p>
<p>Memorials for ever indestructible. </p>
<p>If part decay, part is ever renewed. </p>
<p>I know the marks of the apostle and his w r ell-known place <br/>
And the grave w'hose digger hid him in the dust. </p>
<p>There I stood weeping the apostle, </p>
<p>My very eyelids ran with tears, 3 </p>
<p>Reminding me of. his favours. Methinks my soul </p>
<p>Cannot recount them and halts bewildered. </p>
<p>Ahmad’s loss exhausted my soul with pain <br/>
While it recounted the apostle’s favours. </p>
<p>Yet has it failed to recapture a tithe of w'hat he did <br/>
But my soul can only report what it feels. </p>
<p>Long did I stand crying bitterly </p>
<p>Over the mound of the grave wffere Ahmad lies. </p>
<p>Be blessed, O grave of the apostle, and be blessed <br/>
The land in which the righteous guided one lived, </p>
<p>And blessed the niche that holds the good one <br/>
Surmounted by a building of broad stones! </p>
<p>Hands poured dust upon him, eyes their tears, </p>
<p>And the lucky stars set at the sight. </p>
<p>They hid kindness, knowledge, and mercy <br/>
The night they laid him unpillowed in the dust <br/>
And w'ent away in sorrow without their prophet, </p>
<p>Their arms and backs devoid of strength. </p>
<p>They mourn him whose day the heavens mourn—- <br/>
The earth too—yet men grieve more. </p>
<p>Can any day the dead is mourned </p>
<p>Equal the mourning of the day Muhammad died ? </p>
<p>On which the seat of revelation was taken from them <br/>
Which had been a source of light everywhere. </p>

From him came the easing of their difficulty. </p>

<p>He was anxious that they should go on the right path. </p>
<p>He sympathized with them one and all 1 <br/>
In his kindness he smoothed their path. </p>
<p>But while they enjoyed that light <br/>
Suddenly death’s arrow hit its mark <br/>
And sent the praised one back to God <br/>
While the very angels wept and praised him. 2 <br/>
The holy land became desolate <br/>
At the loss of the revelation it once knew: </p>
<p>Deserts uninhabited save the grave in which our lost one descended <br/>
Whom Balat and Gharqad 3 and his mosque mourn. </p>
<p>In those places desolate, now' he is gone, </p>
<p>Are places of prayer devoted to him, </p>
<p>And at the great stoning place there dwellings and open spaces, <br/>
Encampment, and birthplace are desolate. </p>
<p>O eye, weep the apostle of God copiously, </p>
<p>May I never find you with your tears dried! </p>
<p>Why do you not weep the kindly one <br/>
Whose bounteous robe covered all men? </p>
<p>Be generous with your tears and cries </p>
<p>At the loss of him whose equal will ne’er be found. </p>
<p>Those gone by never lost one like Muhammad </p>
<p>And one like him will not be mourned till Resurrection Day </p>
<p>More gentle and faithful to obligation after obligation; </p>
<p>More prone to give without thought of any return; </p>
<p>More lavish with wealth newly gained and inherited </p>
<p>When a generous man would grudge giving what had long been his. </p>
<p>More noble in reputation when claims are examined; </p>
<p>More noble in princely Meccan ancestry; 4 </p>
<p>More inaccessible in height and established in eminence </p>
<p>Founded on enduring supports, </p>
<p>Firmer in root and branch and wood <br/>
Which rain nourished making it full of life. </p>
<p>1 Or ‘not preferring one to another’. </p>
<p>2 Another reading is ‘the unseen angels’ (jinn) and yuhmadu. But perhaps jafn should <br/>
be read here for haqq. 'The eyes of the angels’, &amp;c. </p>
<p>3 Bala{ lay between the mosque and the market of Medina, while Gharqad was its <br/>
cemetery. A.Dh. renders ‘plane and box-tree’. </p>
<p>4 Lit. ‘valley ancestry’. The valley-dwellers of Quraysh were regarded as the aristocracy. </p>
<p>797 </p>
<p>Ibn Hishdm’s Notes </p>
<p>A glorious Lord brought him up as a boy <br/>
And he became perfect in most virtuous deeds. </p>
<p>To his knowledge the Muslims resorted; </p>
<p>No knowledge was withheld and no opinion was gainsaid. </p>
<p>I say, and none can find fault with me <br/>
But one lost to all sense, </p>
<p>I shall never cease to praise him. </p>
<p>It may be for so doing I shall be for ever in Paradise <br/>
With the chosen one for whose support in that I hope <br/>
And to attain to that day I devote all my efforts. </p>
<p>Hassan also said: </p>
<p>What ails thine eye that it cannot sleep <br/>
As though its ducts were painted with the kohl of one suffering from <br/>
ophthalmia </p>
<p>In grief for the guided one who lies dead ? </p>
<p>O best man that ever walked the earth, leave us not! </p>
<p>Alas, would that my face might protect thee from the dust, </p>
<p>That I had been buried before thee in Baqfu’I-Gharqad! </p>
<p>Dearer than father and mother is he whose death I saw <br/>
On that Monday—the truly guided prophet. </p>
<p>When he died I lost my wits distracted, </p>
<p>Would that I had ne’er been born! </p>
<p>Am I to go on living in Medina without you? </p>
<p>Would that I had been given snake poison to drink; </p>
<p>Or that God’s decree would reach us soon, </p>
<p>Tonight or at least tomorrow; </p>
<p>That our hour might come and we might meet the good, </p>
<p>The pure in nature, the man of noble descent! </p>
<p>O blessed firstborn of Amina </p>
<p>Whom that chaste one bore on the happiest of days! </p>
<p>He shed a light on all creatures, </p>
<p>He who is guided to the blessed light is rightly guided. </p>
<p>O Lord, unite us with our prophet in a garden <br/>
That turns away the eyes of the envious, </p>
<p>In the garden of Paradise. Inscribe it for us, </p>
<p>O Lord of Majesty, Loftiness, and Power. </p>
<p>By God as long as I live I shall not hear of the dead <br/>
But I shall weep for the prophet Muhammad. </p>
<p>Alas for the prophet’s Helpers and kin </p>
<p>After he has been hidden in the midst of the grave. </p>
<p>The land became too strait for the Ansar, </p>
<p>Their faces were black as antimony. </p>
<p>We gave him his ancestors, 1 his grave is with us, </p>
<p>His overflowing goodness to us is undeniable. </p>
<p>God honoured and guided us his Helpers by him <br/>
In every hour that he was present. </p>

<li>The last half of the first verse has not I.I.’s authority. </li>
</ol>
<p>1 It is worth noting that the verse </p>
<p>The Christians and Jews of Yathrih rejoiced <br/>
When he was laid in his grave </p>
<p>included in I.I.’s Diwdn (cxxxiii) without comment is not to be found in any MS. of I.II., <br/>
nor is it in C. or W. or Suhayll’s text. It may well be condemned as a later addition. W. <br/>
(iii, pp. liv-lv) held that I.H.’s text of 1 lassan’s poems w'as superior to the Dlvcan which has <br/>
been published several times since his day but never with the care it deserves. W.’s judge¬ <br/>
ment still stands. </p>
<p>ADDENDA </p>
<p>p. 28, n. r. I have discussed the significance of this story in the The Islamic <br/>
Quarterly, 1954, pp. 9 f. </p>
<p>p. 30, 1 . 13. For the text of Sabaean inscriptions recently discovered in <br/>
Su'udt Arabia sec G. Ryckmans in Museon, ixvi, 1953, pp. 267-317; and for <br/>
an historical commentary on the same ib., pp. 319-42. Professor Sidney <br/>
Smith, ‘Events in Arabia in the 6th century a.d.’, in B.S.O.A.S., 1954, <br/>
pp. 425-68, has‘discussed all that Greek, Syriac, Sabaean, and Arabic <br/>
authorities report. So far as the Arabic -writers are concerned, his verdict is <br/>
that their account ‘is not incompatible with the known facts’. </p>
<p>p. 65, n. 3. The Meccan editor of al-Azraql (ii. 176 and 179) throws no light <br/>
on the confusion. </p>
<p>p. 88, 1 . 14. I have adopted the reading of C. against W. in spite of the intro¬ <br/>
duction to the verse. </p>
<p>p. 100, 1 . 13 from end. The last three verses are reminiscent pf the Quran, as <br/>
are the lines beginning ‘I submit myself’ on p. 102, 1. 28. </p>
<p>p. 180, pen. Perhaps what 'Umar said was ‘(The birds) must be ostriches’ <br/>
(na'amci), and the prophet immediately punned on the word by saying anama. </p>
<p>p. 181. I have shown in Al-Andalus , xviii, 1953, pp. 323-36, that the Masjid <br/>
al-Aqsa was not at Jerusalem but at al-Ji'rana, a place within the sacred area <br/>
of Mecca. </p>
<p>p. 191, 1 . 11. For ‘protection’ read ‘neighbourliness’. </p>
<p>p. 226, 1 . 6 from end. Dhu Kashr is correct. See Yaqut, iv. 276 ult. W, has <br/>
Dhu Kashd. </p>
<p>p. 233, II. 16 and 18. The host has only a limited control over his ally ( hallf ), <br/>
who is his equal, but the sojourner {jar) is his dependant and he is responsible <br/>
for his acts because he has authority over him. Cf. p. 723. </p>
<p>p. 238, 1 . 11. AzraqT, ii. 118, who says that Ibn 'Abbas was frequently seen to <br/>
visit $irmaas he repeated this poem, apparently knew no more than seven lines <br/>
corresponding roughly to 1-3 and 6-9 in I.I.’s version and to No. XIX in <br/>
Hirschfeld’s edition of the Diwan of Hassan b. Thabit. I.H. in his note <br/>
No. 291 says that lines 12 and 13 were not composed by $irma but by a <br/>
certain Taghlibite called Suraym b. Ma'shar. He accepts lines 4-5 and 10-12 <br/>
without comment. Azraqi’s version is complete in itself. It falls into the <br/>
pattern of An sari propaganda; it shows how the Medinans welcomed <br/>
Muhammad when Quraysh (Hirschfeld’s ‘Mecca’ violates the scansion) <br/>
spurned him, and how they devoted their lives and their wealth to his service. <br/>
Thus the history of this 'p° em illustrates what has been said on pp. xxvi f. <br/>
about Ansari propaganda and about poems fathered on Hassan. </p>
<p>p. 384, I. 7 from end. W. has 'Abdullah b. Payf. Authorities differ. </p>
